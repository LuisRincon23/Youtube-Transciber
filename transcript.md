[00:15] Evan help me cheerful
[00:17] [Music]
[00:19] it's not easy fun in your place this
[00:24] could be our opportunity to take control
[00:25] of our lives but if it's not love it'll
[00:28] just break it'll surround
[00:31] we can't stop fighting for the ones you
[00:33] love you can be strong
[00:35] in place knowing your leaders to you I'm
[00:38] not fighting about bathrooms I'm
[00:40] fighting about her life
[00:42] [Music]
[00:56] I like the idea that the world is
[00:58] changing and I get to be whoever I want
[01:01] when it comes to war I fight when it
[01:04] comes to love I don't use science

[02:17] [Music]
[02:23] there's no way to get an accurate count
[02:26] of LGBT suicides in the Mormon community
[02:28] but we do know that youth suicide rates
[02:30] in Utah where a majority of the populace
[02:33] is Mormon has skyrocketed over the past
[02:35] decade
[02:36] I grew up gay and Mormon and in Utah in
[02:38] my morning prayers I would ask that God
[02:40] would do something drastic like cause me
[02:43] to die in a car accident or for me to
[02:46] get cancer or something awful like that
[02:48] when the God that you believe in and the
[02:50] family that raised you and loves you
[02:52] when they reject you you don't have a
[02:54] lot left to live for you see the church
[02:56] between kind of a rock and a hard place
[02:58] when it comes to gay issues we've taken
[03:01] this topic on a number of occasions it's
[03:04] not going away where do we stand on this
[03:06] we regard same-sex marriage as a
[03:09] significant serious kind of sin simply
[03:13] being attracted to someone of the same
[03:15] gender is not a sin it is when we act on
[03:19] the inclination or the attraction [ __ ]
[03:22] hurts finally said there's nothing wrong
[03:24] with being gay as long as you don't do
[03:27] gay stuff so if you're a gay Mormon and
[03:30] you're in a relationship with a man
[03:31] you're fine as long as you don't hug him
[03:34] or kiss him or hold hands with him or
[03:36] have sex with him or marry him or live
[03:37] with him or be in a relationship with
[03:39] him and today I'm talking with Las Vegas
[03:41] resident Dan Reynolds who is the lead
[03:43] singer of imagine dragons Reynolds is on
[03:46] a mission quite apart from his musical
[03:48] career he's putting together a
[03:49] documentary examining policies in the
[03:52] Mormon Church regarding the LGBTQ
[03:54] community Dan Reynolds it's great to
[03:56] have you back
[03:57] [Applause]
[04:14] there are far too many Mormons in Utah
[04:17] that are taking their lives and so this
[04:20] is this is an issue that needs to be
[04:22] discussed now the families need to be
[04:24] having this this discussion in their
[04:25] homes and now
[04:28] [Music]
[04:33] you grew up Mormon you don't have to be
[04:36] a member of the church a lot of people
[04:38] will say you know what if you don't
[04:39] agree just get out I don't feel a need
[04:42] to denounce Mormonism
[04:44] I do feel a need as a Mormon to speak
[04:47] out against things that I think are
[04:48] hurting people
[04:49] [Applause]
[04:50] [Music]
[04:54] [Applause]
[04:58] dan do you feel like in some ways you
[05:02] yourself might be leading people astray
[05:03] people have reached out and said hey you
[05:06] know you've lost your way and God
[05:08] believes that being gay is a sin and you
[05:11] should you know you're dragging down you
[05:13] know your you are spreading a message of
[05:16] against God's will
[05:21] [Music]
[05:26] like a lot of rich people you could just
[05:29] ignore all this go on with the rest of
[05:31] your life why are you doing this why are
[05:33] you putting yourself out there the
[05:34] community I was raised with is Mormonism
[05:36] and I was always taught that if you want
[05:39] to make a difference in the world you
[05:41] start with your community that's a
[05:42] question I had as well Dan I mean do you
[05:45] actually think you're gonna change the
[05:46] church
[05:53] [Music]
[05:57] [Applause]
[06:31] [Music]
[06:39] this song I think is probably gonna be
[06:41] our next single it's been a little bit
[06:45] of the debate of my existence for the
[06:47] last couple months because I just
[06:49] haven't felt like it was totally right
[06:51] yet I woke up at like 3 a.m. this
[06:56] morning with like countermelody idea in
[06:58] my head for this end part
[07:17] this song's it's called thunder but it's
[07:20] like you know this you know this time in
[07:23] my life was lightning before the Thunder
[07:25] it was like you know when I was young
[07:27] feeling a little misplaced feeling never
[07:30] quite like I settled in a pocket I am
[07:42] the seventh son nine kids
[07:44] I was raised Mormon latter-day Saint as
[07:49] Mormon say LDS there's really all I knew
[07:52] growing up because when you grow up you
[07:54] just you think everybody's Mormon or at
[07:56] least most of the world's Mormon so in
[07:59] the Mormon Church you're supposed to go
[08:01] on a mission when you turn 19 years old
[08:03] a mission is two years away from your
[08:06] family you knock doors all day
[08:09] we're missionaries from the Church of
[08:11] Jesus Christ of latter-day saints thank
[08:14] you okay that's okay when you start as a
[08:16] missionary you get into one like out of
[08:20] every $100 you knock what carries you on
[08:25] is your complete resolute belief in what
[08:30] you're doing you are resilient about it
[08:33] and so you knock those hundred doors
[08:36] tonight it would just eat it my
[08:38] testimony of this gospel is
[08:40] I know it's real and it does bring true
[08:43] happiness I came home from my mission
[08:44] and I allowed my brain to really think
[08:47] about life and what I wanted out of it
[08:49] and who I wanted to be everybody you
[08:52] know in the Mormon community knew my
[08:53] family was like the smart Reynolds the
[08:55] the the doctors the lawyers the good
[08:58] kids you want your daughter to date a
[08:59] Reynolds boy you know they're good kids
[09:01] you know my brothers I went to BYU they
[09:04] all married you know great Mormon girls
[09:07] had great women families and I didn't
[09:09] want to be the one to break that cycle
[09:10] and so it just you know it seemed like
[09:13] the easy route like you follow the line
[09:26] [Applause]
[09:45] [Laughter]
[09:47] no it's okay I'll just look and see oh
[09:54] just honey it's like my family so I have
[09:59] a four-year-old daughter
[10:00] Eero she was born right when her first
[10:02] album came out let's just say I am the
[10:05] boss and now I have two more little
[10:11] girls twins fraternal she is so huge
[10:14] unnie my wife who is the greatest human
[10:21] being ever stopped taking on it I'm not
[10:23] I'm just trying to feel like she's a
[10:24] free head and boogers in her eyes well
[10:26] no I just want to get the boogers out of
[10:28] her eyes because that what drives me
[10:29] crazy too
[10:30] when I met him he was just a part of
[10:33] this kind of I don't want to say closed
[10:36] community but it was like there wasn't
[10:38] really a lot of outside it's like a very
[10:42] Mormon community you know and I was
[10:45] definitely an alien to that
[10:49] we had this like connection but there
[10:52] were conversations early on that we're
[10:54] like you know we can't date if I was
[10:57] Mormon we could entertain the idea but
[10:59] we can't we did try to be friends a lot
[11:06] we kept being like okay look we're just
[11:08] I can't have you like out of my life so
[11:11] we have to we have to try to figure out
[11:13] how to be friends but then it would just
[11:14] we would hang out or see each other or
[11:16] whatever and it was just like too much
[11:18] energy between us too and it couldn't go
[11:21] anywhere and the energy somewhat mojo in
[11:25] the air I would always be like I can't
[11:27] do this I can't talk to you anymore if
[11:30] we can't be together I cannot see you
[11:32] like I can't talk to you because I was
[11:34] so in love with him and it just hurt Dan
[11:40] had sent a song that he had written and
[11:42] he had only written part of it the song
[11:44] and I was like oh well I'll just write a
[11:47] verse and send it back it was like
[11:53] written to me you know and so I would
[11:56] like write a response in the song and it
[11:59] was like the stuff we couldn't say in
[12:01] real life
[12:02] [Music]
[12:07] but it was like still very much like you
[12:10] have to be Mormon if we're gonna date
[12:14] [Music]
[12:22] I'm not gonna forget about this person
[12:25] he felt like he was my soulmate and so I
[12:28] decided to start going and just learning
[12:31] more about the church that's when I
[12:33] started to say okay well if I can like
[12:35] really just follow my own heart inside
[12:37] of it I don't see why I can't like
[12:39] progress in this direction so I did kind
[12:44] of just do that and I felt fine about it
[12:48] except for the gay rights the Mormon
[12:52] Church supported proposition 8 a
[12:54] proposal restricting the definition of
[12:57] marriage as being a union solely between
[12:59] a man and a woman
[13:00] Mormons became the most powerful force
[13:03] in California's fight against gay
[13:05] marriage because the church called upon
[13:07] its members to donate as much money and
[13:09] time as they could to the cause and so
[13:12] we asked you to give your best to this
[13:15] most significant effort support in every
[13:19] way possible
[13:19] the sacred institution of marriage as we
[13:23] know it to be when prop 8 was going down
[13:26] in my heart I was like I don't I I don't
[13:29] feel good about this but whatever
[13:30] doesn't affect me which i think is a
[13:33] mentality of probably a lot of
[13:34] Christians and people it doesn't affect
[13:36] me and it'll figure itself out in the
[13:39] eternities with God it was right when I
[13:41] was meeting aja her two best friends who
[13:44] were lesbians and they were you know all
[13:45] very act like very very active
[13:48] I was like marching alongside them yeah
[13:52] and so it was like she was like well
[13:54] they told me that Mormons believe this
[13:56] and that they're really like funding
[13:58] these things of Prop 8 is that true and
[13:59] I'm like well it is true but I think no
[14:04] part of me was just like why are you
[14:05] Mormon then I'm like it's complicated
[14:08] when I started to look into and take the
[14:11] lessons and convert I really had to
[14:14] ignore that whole thing I
[14:16] had to just ignore it because I was it
[14:19] was inferior
[14:20] infuriating we got married in my parents
[14:23] backyard and her two best friends didn't
[14:28] come to our marriage because she was
[14:31] basically marrying into Mormonism in
[14:32] their eyes which was in the heat of prop
[14:35] 8 was the reason they couldn't get
[14:37] married
[14:38] his wife's lesbian roommates not wanting
[14:42] to go to their wedding I think he saw
[14:44] something and said oh there's something
[14:46] wrong here there's something that can be
[14:48] better here something I can fix I can do
[14:50] something and I don't think you knew
[14:52] what or how but I know he wanted to so I
[14:56] I still feel guilt you know with that
[15:00] that I I just was like a silent person
[15:04] you know granted my voice was pretty
[15:07] meaningless it's not to say a voice is
[15:10] meaningless but I didn't have any reach
[15:12] you know my dad was a big puddle of
[15:15] nothing growing up dan was in different
[15:18] bands and he'd always been making music
[15:21] but there is no guarantee you can make
[15:24] something marketable and earn a living
[15:25] at this and I remember one time sitting
[15:30] down with my mom and dad and they said
[15:34] so Dan wants to do this rock thing being
[15:37] a rock band so just tell us what's his
[15:39] chance of success regardless of the fact
[15:41] that I knew he was driven and he had a
[15:45] good voice and I thought he wrote
[15:46] amazing melodies I said zero
[15:48] [Applause]
[15:49] [Music]
[15:51] [Applause]
[15:53] imagine dragons just like
[15:55] [Music]
[16:01] [Applause]
[16:03] suddenly it was like everybody just
[16:05] screaming at you you know great things
[16:09] and terrible things and it was all just
[16:11] a new thing to me what's been like the
[16:13] biggest crowd response that you just
[16:14] felt overwhelmed I've been overwhelmed
[16:16] honestly every name I don't know that I
[16:18] could think of many more opposite worlds
[16:21] than that of a Mormon missionary and
[16:24] that of a rock star it was completely
[16:27] shocking to me to be kind of thrust into
[16:29] the world like I had to relearn
[16:32] everything about everything I had known
[16:53] love your music
[16:55] I heard you have depression I also have
[16:57] depression but listen to your music
[17:00] really takes me away from it right now I
[17:03] feel worthless life is just really hard
[17:06] I have no self esteem but your music
[17:08] makes it much easier I'm thankful for
[17:10] your music I'm also very thankful that
[17:12] you were Mormon and if I type in like
[17:15] Mormon there's like you know hundreds of
[17:18] emails I'm in middle school and I'm
[17:20] Mormon but I'm very different I'm not
[17:22] I'm not pretty I'm not popular but I
[17:25] don't care I have anxiety and depression
[17:28] I've had them since I was young I was
[17:31] also told this was Dan Reynolds and I
[17:32] thought it'd be cool to tell him about
[17:34] myself suddenly I started to really
[17:36] realize the weight of something that I
[17:39] think I already knew which was that
[17:41] there's not a lot of famous Mormons I
[17:47] want to tell you something personal to
[17:49] show you how important you are for me
[17:51] and how much you help me I'm struggling
[17:53] a lot with self-acceptance and anxiety
[17:55] this is because of many reasons there's
[17:57] one big thing that annoys me the most my
[17:59] sexuality I hate myself for a lot of
[18:02] this I don't even want to know where I
[18:05] would be without your music I've no idea
[18:07] if you support same-sex marriage since
[18:10] you are a Mormon
[18:11] if you don't it's okay and I respect you
[18:14] but if you do support it thank you a lot
[18:16] and it means the world to me
[18:19] Tom who sent me this email says all
[18:22] these sweet things and at the bottom you
[18:24] know hey you know if you do I respect
[18:27] you but I know that how he I know that
[18:30] he is hurt and is looking for someone
[18:34] from this band that he likes to tell him
[18:36] no Tom I'm not judging you you know and
[18:38] I never even wrote him back because I
[18:40] haven't read that email - right now cuz
[18:43] there's so many emails but
[18:53] this is this is something that I've
[18:56] really had on my mind for years and it's
[19:00] come to a head I think lately because um
[19:04] because I associate my my my families
[19:08] more menu it's my culture I know that
[19:12] there's so many people like this Mormons
[19:14] who I know look up to me as a person you
[19:17] know standing as a face for the Mormon
[19:19] Church and I've been so conflicted
[19:27] because I don't know whether to you know
[19:30] let down all these people were Mormon
[19:32] and looking to me or to be part of to
[19:37] stand back and then be if I'm passive if
[19:43] if I'm just standing if I just stand
[19:45] back and say I don't wanna talk about
[19:47] Mormonism or something in the past and
[19:48] stuff then I I have felt this Bert which
[19:52] I have done then I feel this burden like
[19:55] I feel guilt I feel like I am standing
[20:01] then for bigotry
[20:10] I went on a mission at 19 I think it
[20:16] just felt like a safe choice to go and
[20:18] give me more space to figure out myself
[20:20] so I got called to Nebraska and I was
[20:24] kind of hoping I was gonna go to like
[20:26] Tokyo or something
[20:29] [Music]
[20:34] Tyler and I both served in Omaha
[20:37] Nebraska he had finished his two years
[20:38] right as I was coming out like we barely
[20:40] linked like that but it was enough that
[20:42] like the shadow of Tyler was still there
[20:46] my first companion had a CD that said
[20:50] like Tyler Glenn on it and he told me
[20:52] that it was this missionary and was
[20:54] writing songs in his spare time
[20:58] [Music]
[20:59] yeah on my mission I had really a great
[21:02] experience it really shaped this sort of
[21:06] headphone wearing like kind of pseudo
[21:09] goth kid into like a someone that could
[21:13] talk to people yeah I got home and and
[21:20] then I decided to be gay for a little
[21:23] bit and that started the conflict I got
[21:33] home for my mission and Tyler had
[21:36] started a band called Neon Trees
[21:39] his bamboo up and then my band blew up I
[21:42] would see him at festivals I'd be like
[21:44] hey guy that's Mormon in that band hey
[21:47] I'm guy that over here that's more of an
[21:48] in this band I followed him I saw the
[21:51] things he was saying cuz he was like a
[21:53] Mormon in the press being gay and
[21:55] closeted that became a master
[21:57] compartmentalize er I was able to sort
[21:59] of compartmentalize a version of
[22:01] Mormonism that fit so come 29 we've put
[22:07] out two successful records and we toured
[22:08] the world six times I'm living my dream
[22:11] you know so like I should be happy and
[22:13] I'm not content at all and I'm thinking
[22:16] I can't keep thinking this is a cool
[22:18] secret that I can live with the rest of
[22:19] my life it was like I just I have to
[22:22] come out I came out to my producer I was
[22:29] just like Tim do you want to know what
[22:30] these songs are about and like just
[22:34] saying it to him and having sort of the
[22:37] reaction from us from like a straight
[22:40] man like I always feared would probably
[22:44] ridicule me because that was my
[22:45] experience um he like said I'm so happy
[22:49] for you and it was the first time that I
[22:52] ever attributed like positivity ever to
[22:56] being gay I was expecting my life
[22:59] determined to [ __ ] or to feel sinful or
[23:03] shame and I didn't know all of his I was
[23:05] met with such
[23:08] you know just inclusion it was you know
[23:12] three years after prop 8 so I was met
[23:15] with a lot of LDS people saying we need
[23:17] this conversation to broaden as a church
[23:21] nobody should be more loving and
[23:23] compassionate no family who has anybody
[23:26] who has the same gender issue should
[23:28] exclude them from the family circle
[23:31] Tyler did an interview with Rolling
[23:33] Stone that was like I'm gonna be gay and
[23:35] Mormon and I'm gonna make it work and I
[23:38] feel like a lot of the Mormon community
[23:39] was like whoa look at this he's gay and
[23:43] he's warm he's gonna make it work what
[23:44] does that mean maybe he's celibate I
[23:45] don't know but hey he's gonna make it
[23:47] work he's happy you know started dating
[23:49] guy openly and I took him to Temple
[23:53] Square for me it was like when you and I
[23:56] have a kid we're raising a Mormon and
[23:58] this means a lot to me and about a month
[24:01] after that it was November 5th and a pop
[24:05] the policy was leaked the Church of
[24:09] Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints has
[24:10] come under intense scrutiny following
[24:12] their new official orders against
[24:14] homosexuality baptism and children the
[24:17] new policy change states that same-sex
[24:19] couples will also now be considered
[24:20] apostate saying it will no longer bless
[24:23] or baptize children of same-sex couples
[24:25] until the child turns 18 once a child
[24:28] turns 18 he or she will have to disavow
[24:31] same-sex marriage then they can be
[24:33] blessed and baptized by the church say
[24:37] they're in a church
[24:38] it suddenly felt dark and I'd never felt
[24:41] dark at church at always fully this is
[24:42] the safe place and I need to cling to
[24:44] this I'm watching my brother baptize his
[24:48] son and he and I don't ever get to do
[24:51] that because I'm gay and he's straight
[24:52] and um I just had taken you know the guy
[24:57] was seeing to the temple and I was doing
[24:59] all of these these things to sort of
[25:02] remain and I it just hit me that I have
[25:06] to leave and I remember
[25:08] telling my mom on the way to dinner
[25:10] after the baptism I'm like mom I i I
[25:16] believe and I um and I know the Book of
[25:20] Mormon is true I know the church is true
[25:21] but I have to leave because like they've
[25:23] clearly drawn a line and it feels like
[25:25] the last you know gut punch please have
[25:33] a little in me
[25:35] I know you hate it when I stray that I
[25:40] tried everything I drank the wine and
[25:43] stained the sheets I'm clumsy when I
[25:46] speak I just realized I need to make an
[25:50] album about all these feelings time to
[25:56] put out a record that was very
[25:58] controversial within the Mormon
[26:00] community
[26:03] [Applause]
[26:09] it was very visceral I'm like very angry
[26:12] he was like ripping up the Book of
[26:14] Mormon he was painting on like the
[26:16] Apostles faces a lot of Mormons saw that
[26:18] and we're like offended and angry at
[26:21] Tyler and then I think a lot of Mormon
[26:23] sod and were hurt for Tyler
[26:25] he definitely weighed like very heavily
[26:28] on my heart so I'm not coming Sunday
[26:34] it's all right
[26:36] I probably talked to you man
[26:53] hey how you doing man good man yeah I
[26:56] don't even know where to start really
[27:00] III feel like I should have made this
[27:03] call like two years ago you know I've
[27:07] watched you over the last you know a
[27:11] couple years and I've watched you just
[27:13] go through this and I've been like a
[27:15] really shitty bystander honestly and so
[27:20] I guess first I just want to like
[27:21] apologize because I feel like you know I
[27:24] feel like you know I don't know who else
[27:29] you could relate to how many other
[27:31] people you could relate to in this
[27:32] industry that are like Mormon and and
[27:34] have to feel conflicted about all these
[27:37] things and I don't know I just feel
[27:39] thank you wow that's really cool but the
[27:44] question I want to ask you is what now
[27:46] like what can I do what can like you
[27:51] know I had like this little idea in my
[27:52] head and tell me if it's stupid what if
[27:54] me and you got together and we put on
[27:56] like a big event in Salt Lake City me
[27:59] and you so people can come together and
[28:01] be like inclusive of everybody and tell
[28:05] them all like this needs to change you
[28:08] know I know we can't force the church to
[28:09] change it but maybe we can like by
[28:11] raising more awareness and making more
[28:13] Mormons in their heart feel like this
[28:15] isn't right maybe that's the but you
[28:17] know what I mean maybe that's what's
[28:18] gonna start that's good a snake man
[28:20] dude I'm done like absolutely let's do
[28:23] it I'm so amped right now I'm like where
[28:28] does this amazing thing this is for
[28:30] Mormons this is for non-mormons is for
[28:33] the LGBT non-mormons LGBT Mormons like
[28:36] this is where the world to come to so
[28:38] you know what I thought about first
[28:39] thing came to my mind food food if we
[28:43] can get food trucks awesome that's what
[28:46] I think nothing in food and really what
[28:48] the thinking is how do we not offend 50
[28:50] percent of the people who come you're
[28:51] just trying to
[28:52] people you're not trying to who you just
[28:55] said right there enlighten people that
[28:57] says the people you're you're in the
[29:00] dark let me enlighten no no educate
[29:03] you're stupid
[29:05] let me educate no that's not true I
[29:08] think people don't know statistics they
[29:09] don't know the reality of what's
[29:11] happening you can't come in and say
[29:12] you're wrong
[29:13] let's come in and say let's talk and
[29:16] believe that you change people's minds
[29:20] you don't that changes people's minds
[29:22] they have to change their minds we have
[29:24] to like in my opinion it's like could
[29:27] you put Bologna in this there's ham in
[29:29] there it's really weird taste it is it
[29:31] we don't usually put him in sandwiches
[29:33] right this is but it's like what was in
[29:35] there the Mormon this is where I was
[29:37] raised Mormonism so this is my community
[29:39] these are my people
[29:40] that's the last thing I want to do is to
[29:43] say I'm right you're wrong but come and
[29:44] let me tell you why it needs to be
[29:46] everybody come to the table and let's
[29:48] see what's happening this is these are
[29:51] the people who are in it you know their
[29:54] message is 10 times more powerful than
[29:56] me getting up hey I'm the singer of
[29:58] imagine dragons you know that song
[30:00] radioactive radioactive now let me tell
[30:03] you everything that I know about this
[30:04] subject because I really don't know that
[30:06] much and everybody's gonna be like I'm
[30:09] all heart I'm the education is yet to
[30:11] come
[30:11] [Laughter]
[30:25] John how you doing - talking to me yeah
[30:36] yeah I hear and I see good you're a
[30:39] little choppy here and there but not bad
[30:41] I'll close about your windows and just
[30:43] make sure you know you play World of
[30:45] Warcraft for your time
[30:49] my name is Shawn Dylan and I'm a 6th
[30:52] generation Mormon raised as a devout
[30:55] Orthodox believing Mormon Mormonism was
[30:59] everything to me because my parents had
[31:00] been divorced and I felt like the church
[31:02] took care of me and nurtured me when my
[31:04] family was falling apart
[31:05] in 2009 I started a PhD in clinical and
[31:08] counseling psychology I was just
[31:10] noticing all these LGBT Mormons that
[31:12] were depressed and suicidal and the
[31:16] church was encouraging mixed orientation
[31:17] marriages where you're gay but you
[31:19] married a straight person
[31:20] my name is Ricardo I am a Mormon
[31:24] I'm a father of six children and I am
[31:28] attracted to men the attractions aren't
[31:30] gonna go away they're gonna be there my
[31:32] whole life but I don't feel that I'm
[31:35] losing anything in my life to me that's
[31:38] been out and thick is finding that core
[31:41] happiness within you
[31:43] and for me is important that that core
[31:46] happiness is aligned with my beliefs of
[31:48] the gospel they were encouraging
[31:50] celibacy I feel now being around people
[31:53] that know that I'm gay I'm able to be
[31:56] myself and I'm not having to make up
[32:01] excuses of why I'm not dating or I'm not
[32:04] married or I'm not falling in love
[32:06] what's been so great about this
[32:09] experience is that I've been able to
[32:12] understand what really makes me happy
[32:14] and that is pleasing God so we decided
[32:18] to study what decisions led to help the
[32:22] outcomes for LGBTQ people and what
[32:24] decisions led to unhealthy outcomes I
[32:27] just wanted to understand a couple
[32:29] things
[32:30] can you change being gay or lesbian if
[32:33] you try what happens if you just try and
[32:35] be celibate what happens if you just try
[32:37] and marry a woman makes orientation
[32:40] marriages we're a disaster celibacy was
[32:43] the worst possible option that they
[32:45] could have chosen hundreds and hundreds
[32:49] of the people mentioned suicide in their
[32:51] narratives of wanting to kill themselves
[32:52] because of the struggle feeling like God
[32:55] didn't love him that God wouldn't heal
[32:58] them and so they must have been beyond
[32:59] God's love and power the suicide rates
[33:02] in Utah are alarming we've seen suicide
[33:07] rates of youth between the ages of 15
[33:09] and 19 double in the past two to three
[33:11] years and triple over the past eight or
[33:14] nine years since 2008 nowhere else in
[33:17] the entire United States are we seeing
[33:19] youth suicide rates double and triple
[33:23] over that same time period and so what's
[33:26] the cause what happened in 2007-2008 it
[33:30] was when the predominant religion within
[33:33] the state of Utah declares war on LGBT
[33:37] people
[33:38] today I'd like to explain how he became
[33:41] an LGBT ally as a Mormon I gave a TED
[33:45] talk in 2013 I want to begin by making a
[33:50] point that you can literally save the
[33:54] lives of your LGBT brothers and sisters
[33:57] sons and daughters through love well I
[34:01] gave the TED talk in like October or
[34:03] November 2013 and by January or February
[34:07] of 2014 my bishop had called me in and
[34:10] told me he was starting an investigation
[34:12] into my membership and in senator of
[34:15] 2015 I was excommunicated from the
[34:17] church there's no doubt in my mind that
[34:21] my public support of LGBT people was a
[34:23] major factor my excommunication
[34:27] excommunication
[34:28] is is about the worst thing that a that
[34:30] a Mormon could ever experience it
[34:32] basically means from a religious
[34:34] perspective that you're cut off from
[34:36] your family for all of eternity that
[34:38] your family is going to go to this
[34:40] really nice place in heaven and you're
[34:42] gonna be alone in a dark set place and
[34:45] that's what excommunication means it
[34:46] means you can't participate at church
[34:48] it's basically condemning you to the
[34:50] Mormon equivalent of Hell and it was but
[34:53] but more than that it's cutting you off
[34:55] from your tribe it's cutting you off
[34:57] from your people from your friends from
[34:59] your family I have family members that
[35:02] won't speak to me
[35:02] and it's it's devastating oh man
[35:09] my family is all Mormon and they're very
[35:13] active I have a I have a real fear of
[35:17] losing all that maybe you've heard the
[35:20] quote the only thing required for evil
[35:26] to persist is for good men to do nothing
[35:28] you've probably heard that right yeah
[35:31] I've always loved the church I still do
[35:33] I still consider myself Mormon and so
[35:37] and I felt the same way you did I didn't
[35:39] want to leave it I didn't want to be a
[35:40] significant cated I do think the number
[35:44] of overt bigots out there is a
[35:47] percentage is really small but the
[35:49] of of Mormons frankly you know just have
[35:53] decided to remain silent is extremely
[35:55] large and so I've been watching you guys
[35:58] and in my heart I'm just like things are
[36:02] gonna change when these guys are willing
[36:04] to speak up
[36:13] [Music]
[36:15] Joey
[36:24] this house was built 125 years ago by a
[36:27] polygamous named William D Alexander
[36:29] yeah you actually you have the view of
[36:30] it out there
[36:31] Wow yeah little did he know that someday
[36:34] his rainbow window would perfectly in
[36:36] case that Rona
[36:38] tapped him or on the top of the Mormon
[36:39] temple so the kids can kind of just come
[36:43] in here after school's out just come
[36:45] hang out find a place at this refuge
[36:47] yeah the whole idea is they just walk in
[36:50] like it's their own home I did have an
[36:52] area thority asked me when these kids
[36:55] come here and you're going to make them
[36:56] more gay and their families aren't and I
[37:00] was like no no no we are just here to
[37:03] love and support them and give them a
[37:05] safe place to be
[37:08] so maybe tell me about how you got
[37:12] involved here my mom volunteered when
[37:20] you came out how was that received with
[37:24] your friends the church it was only this
[37:28] Sunday that I came out to the church
[37:39] I went up during testimony meeting and I
[37:44] bore my testimony and how everyone has
[37:47] made the certain way that they are and
[37:50] how I was made to be gay I felt nervous
[37:55] actually because I didn't know what
[37:58] people react I didn't get to finish all
[38:21] the way through my testimony I think it
[38:24] was like a paragraph later after I said
[38:26] the word lesbian they cut me off it was
[38:40] a member of the state presidency that
[38:41] was their leave over and how to turn off
[38:45] the mic in a stirred request it it was a
[38:49] little depressing and sad but when it
[38:52] happened but I feel more happy now that
[38:55] it has happened because now I got to
[38:58] share my feelings you know if my answer
[39:04] of what resonates here doesn't line up
[39:06] with what the Prophet etc says you know
[39:10] it's like hard for my family to see that
[39:14] all I can do is accept them and love
[39:17] them where they're at and like hope that
[39:19] they can offer the same thing
[39:25] back to me something that happened
[39:30] recently with my brothers honest mission
[39:32] Mikey was like we're in the first year
[39:34] with that I came out to bat the time I
[39:38] told him and when I came out he's like
[39:39] no it's just a dead one he slapped me
[39:41] there pretty hard so when you told him
[39:44] he said it's the devil and he slapped
[39:46] you because you were like following the
[39:49] devil yes all of you in my opinion even
[39:55] being here right now our far braver that
[39:59] I could have could have ever understood
[40:01] because I'm just like dealing with like
[40:03] Oh religion and these things no but but
[40:06] you guys are are so brave thank you
[40:10] thank you for letting me sit and be part
[40:12] of what could be so uncomfortable and I
[40:14] can be the most awkward and you guys
[40:17] made me feel totally comfortable here
[40:19] too and so thank you I love you all and
[40:22] love is love and
[40:30] [Music]
[40:37] and here are our crisis counselors here
[40:41] are ready to take phone calls our
[40:44] research here at The Trevor Project has
[40:46] found that if an LGBTQ young person has
[40:49] one supportive adult the risk of suicide
[40:52] is lessened by 30 percent Wow it's
[40:55] incredible
[40:56] Mormons are way over here in the LGBTQ
[40:57] community is way over here so it's like
[40:59] to me I was like well what's a safe way
[41:01] we can bring everybody together but also
[41:03] a place to be a little more educated and
[41:05] for some Mormons
[41:07] guarantee this will be the first time
[41:08] they'll sit down and listen to someone
[41:11] who is LGBTQ talk for more than like
[41:13] five minutes I have these Mormon moms
[41:16] come in from their temple shift and they
[41:18] they're very defensive until they fall
[41:20] in love with a gay person they could
[41:22] fall in love a tiler for just 5 min and
[41:24] oh then it's game over
[41:29] so dragons trees strike and Dragons
[41:33] trees interspersed with speakers I mean
[41:36] that alone is gonna be like Brad twenty
[41:38] thousand people have you thought about
[41:39] where I think Pioneer Park isn't right
[41:42] next to the temple someone was telling
[41:43] us um it's like three blocks from it
[41:46] three blocks from the temple mm-hmm yeah
[41:49] so they hold huge events here and today
[41:52] of like the dead food trucks or anything
[41:54] yes so there's like vent vendors we
[41:57] think the name of the festival should be
[41:58] it needs to be something that the
[42:00] Mormons are like all this sounds rad and
[42:01] I want to come to it but it should sound
[42:02] progressive and cool and not boring love
[42:05] loud lovely or louder love large
[42:07] festival love loud festival that's kind
[42:09] of cool it is love loud festival are you
[42:12] going to love that that's kind of cool
[42:13] no I'm going to love louder no I'm going
[42:15] to love
[42:23] this new commandment love
[42:32] shall men know ye are my disciples if ye
[42:41] have love one to it's actually pretty
[42:47] yeah it is it's really it's a it's a
[42:50] Mormon
[42:50] and when you're a young Mormon you're in
[42:53] a group called primary and it's like all
[42:56] the young kids like get together and
[42:58] they all have this rambunctious class
[43:00] where they learn about God and you learn
[43:02] like these songs together primary songs
[43:04] yeah primary songs children's hymns yeah
[43:06] basically and one of them first ones you
[43:08] learn is love one another which is a
[43:10] really rad it's actually beautiful yeah
[43:12] it's a beautiful song and the whole
[43:13] point of it is about just love one
[43:15] another and so it's interesting that
[43:18] that gets lost in you know it's when
[43:22] it's really just such a simple idea
[43:24] total it's hot super young in the church
[43:31] [Music]
[43:33] a lot of Mormons are really good-hearted
[43:34] loving kind charitable people who want
[43:38] what's right and they want to be kind
[43:40] and loving and tolerant but they have
[43:43] leaders that are telling them what to
[43:44] think and how to behave if children have
[43:47] a happy family experience they will not
[43:49] want to be homosexuals which I am sure
[43:52] is an acquired addiction just as drugs
[43:54] alcohol and pornography are adultery
[43:56] fornication committing homosexual acts
[44:00] and other deviations approaching these
[44:03] in gravity are not acceptable alternate
[44:06] lifestyles they are serious sins we
[44:10] regard same-sex marriage as a
[44:12] particularly Grievous or a significant
[44:16] serious kind of sin that requires church
[44:19] discipline it means that it's Mormon
[44:21] leaders claim to talk to God so when the
[44:25] church makes statements in the 80s and
[44:27] 90s and 2000's that to be gay is evil
[44:29] that to be in a same-sex marriage or
[44:33] committed relationship is evil they're
[44:35] not just saying that as their own
[44:37] opinion they're basically saying that
[44:38] God speaks to the leader of our church
[44:41] and takes that position as the church is
[44:45] seen in the past when when the church
[44:47] takes a position and then the rest of
[44:49] the nation changes so in the late 1800s
[44:52] the church was a polygamist Church and
[44:54] the rest of the nation wasn't cool at
[44:56] that the church was almost destroyed and
[44:59] so the church had to change fast forward
[45:01] to the 1960s the whole United States is
[45:04] starting to support African Americans
[45:05] and civil rights and the LDS Church is
[45:09] opposing the civil rights movement and
[45:13] that almost destroyed the church and so
[45:15] in 1978 the church changes again he has
[45:18] heard our prayers and by revelation has
[45:21] confirmed that the long-promised day has
[45:23] come when every faithful worthy man in
[45:26] the church may receive the holy
[45:28] priesthood so just like the church
[45:30] eventually got rid of polygamy the
[45:31] church eventually accepted blacks into
[45:34] full fellowship accordingly all worthy
[45:36] male members of the
[45:36] Church maybe ordained to the church to
[45:39] the priesthood without regard for race
[45:41] or color the church changed and said
[45:44] okay now is the time God has spoken
[45:46] now you gotta have the priesthood the
[45:48] thing is you're not going to change
[45:50] God's will
[45:51] he's basically with my mom said my mom
[45:53] said to me when I told her I was doing
[45:54] this she's like well just because you're
[45:56] a rock star dude you can't change God's
[45:58] will well we are to value the rights and
[46:01] feelings of all of God's children we
[46:04] cannot change his doctrine it is not
[46:07] ours to change false prophets and false
[46:10] teachers are those who attempt to change
[46:13] the god-given and scripturally based
[46:16] doctrines that protect the sanctity of
[46:18] marriage just because you go and pound
[46:20] on the brother in store and you're like
[46:22] Thomas s Monson come on change this man
[46:24] come on change it he's not gonna change
[46:26] it for you and cuz God's not he's only
[46:28] doing what God tells him doing God's not
[46:30] gonna change for you but if all the
[46:31] members of a church are talking about
[46:33] something then the prophets gonna pray
[46:35] about it more right I think that maybe
[46:38] I'm one part of this puzzle that's like
[46:40] you know coming together and hopefully
[46:42] the Apostles and the Prophet go pray
[46:43] about it and God comes down and and
[46:46] tells them what's up so you know there's
[46:51] there's a glimmer of hope and in the
[46:53] long-term I think there's a lot of hope
[46:54] the question is is how long will it take
[46:58] to get there and how many people will be
[46:59] hurt along the way so we have three kids
[47:07] and Stockton is the youngest of the
[47:10] three and really our story kind of
[47:14] begins with him at age 12 us finding a
[47:19] letter with him saying that he thought
[47:22] he was gay at earlier times in his life
[47:25] had either of you said maybe he's gay or
[47:29] do you think he's gay does he seem no we
[47:32] yeah our our gaydar was pretty weak how
[47:36] did you think that they would react
[47:40] I thought they'd direct kind of badly
[47:43] because I mean they're Mormon not all
[47:46] morons react kindly to that I don't know
[47:52] I didn't really think they're going to
[47:53] kick me out of the house I didn't think
[47:55] they were going to be oh yeah you're
[47:56] getting cool
[47:57] just kind of hide it yeah you know when
[48:04] we said well let's just kind of ride
[48:06] this out that wasn't his MO his Mo was
[48:08] yeah I think I'm gonna announce it at
[48:10] school tomorrow type thing so yeah yeah
[48:13] his own bullhorn yeah you know he was
[48:15] pretty proud and out I remember I gave
[48:19] him this a pink t neon pink t-shirt that
[48:23] said queer new world and he was so
[48:26] excited by this neon pink shirt because
[48:28] it was gonna scandalize everyone in his
[48:30] school you know he just thought well
[48:33] this is me what's the problem and
[48:36] unfortunately not everybody was ready
[48:38] for that
[48:39] I was kind of like internally realizing
[48:41] that I was gay I got handed a pamphlet
[48:44] for the strength of youth and they said
[48:47] homosexuality is a serious sin and I got
[48:50] very angry about that and kind of just
[48:54] spiraled downward from there
[48:57] [Music]
[49:04] so did you feel that even when he cut
[49:07] ties he probably still felt angry nanny
[49:13] and he just didn't feel safe in a place
[49:15] that he should have felt the safest the
[49:23] rest of society around him from church
[49:25] to school to government kept sending a
[49:29] message to Stockton that he was less
[49:31] than you know often kids would say to
[49:34] him I can associate with you but if my
[49:37] parents find out then I can't it was
[49:40] always you know this constant I like you
[49:44] but or I love you but I could sense you
[49:59] know his frustrations and his anger and
[50:02] his fears would say anything off he'd
[50:06] say what's so wrong with me that he'd
[50:10] just keep her friends
[50:13] [Music]
[50:26] I really didn't see it coming we were in
[50:30] st. George and just got a call that he
[50:38] was calm
[50:48] why didn't he call me because I would
[50:51] have done anything that's what breaks my
[50:55] heart is that he felt that much despair
[50:58] and that he wouldíve out not alone he's
[51:04] he's like all of us we're looking for
[51:06] the community right your tribe and so he
[51:09] was looking for his community and his
[51:11] tribe and so he yeah was it was hard
[51:15] because the the community that should
[51:17] have been so loving and accepting of him
[51:20] and appreciative of his of who he is
[51:22] just I mean Ally thing a lot of these
[51:25] kids really did love him and accept him
[51:27] but they were in at war with their
[51:30] dynamic they're being taught a church
[51:32] for it he's not at home right right yeah
[51:35] we need more voices it's just we need
[51:38] more voices
[51:45] he deserves
[51:57] [Music]
[52:07] [Music]
[52:14] I think amidst all of this a lot of
[52:17] people would wonder why even associate
[52:19] with Mormonism if you know it's causing
[52:21] this much harm why not just walk away
[52:23] and be done
[52:24] we've lost our loved ones we've lost
[52:27] them to suicide I'm not gonna just walk
[52:29] away and let the house on fire burn I'd
[52:33] rather do all that I can with this lucky
[52:37] spot that I've been put in to hopefully
[52:39] put out a fire
[52:40] [Applause]
[52:42] [Music]
[53:07] I'm never
[53:12] I have these tools of like you know hey
[53:19] if I want to put on a festival we're
[53:21] gonna put on a festival and at least
[53:22] some people are gonna come out because
[53:23] mad dragons spike we can get these this
[53:25] press and we can get this interview
[53:26] because of imagine dragons I'm doing
[53:32] great
[53:32] I don't know if you can hear my baby
[53:34] screaming in the background we're doing
[53:37] this documentary I'm also putting on a
[53:38] festival in Utah August 26 called love
[53:41] loud there's gonna be parents we're
[53:42] gonna get up who've lost their child to
[53:45] suicide love loud was this ginormous
[53:48] beast suddenly I was like okay I'm gonna
[53:50] hire an assistant I don't think he had
[53:52] any idea what he was signing up for
[53:53] music festivals usually take at least a
[53:56] year if we're trying to pull us off in a
[53:58] few months we're gonna hopefully create
[54:02] enough rumblings that it gets a ton of
[54:04] press coverage and that people start to
[54:06] understand that telling your child that
[54:08] it's sinful to be gay
[54:11] can be so destructive are you worried
[54:14] about fans being maybe turned off by
[54:17] activism you know come on Dan just play
[54:20] your music I have to to pay attention to
[54:22] my heart and then speak things that are
[54:24] in my heart I felt that by not speaking
[54:26] out I was doing a big disservice to my
[54:29] community my goal is to change this in
[54:32] the church and not to say that I can
[54:34] change the church but at least to bring
[54:36] together a ton of people who are Mormon
[54:38] who have said you know we've had enough
[54:40] with this
[54:43] [Music]
[55:00] I first met Dan in 2006 when I was a shy
[55:18] closeted singer in a local band in Provo
[55:20] Utah called Neon Trees Dan it's
[55:26] unbelievably exciting to see you use
[55:28] your platform to spread the love you
[55:30] have in your heart that is the heroic
[55:32] move we have a special message for you
[55:36] from one of our fans hi Dan my name is
[55:40] Miranda I'm 16 and I am bisexual but for
[55:43] anything else I want to say

[55:47] a difference what you're doing means so
[55:48] much to people like me and I cannot

[55:57] dear friend Dan Reynolds with the Trevor
[55:59] hero award please join me in a round of
[56:01] applause

[56:34] humbling it's humbling and it was it was
[56:36] good for me but I want to I'm sure you
[56:39] wondered where is he going with all this
[56:40] and this is this is where I'm going with
[56:41] it for those two years when people asked
[56:45] me what the doctrine was and they said
[56:48] hey I am gay or I feel you know like I
[56:52] feel like I like girls and what do I do
[56:55] about this I taught that it was a sin
[56:58] because that's what I had been raised to
[57:01] teach I never felt it in my heart since
[57:05] I was young I hold regret about that to
[57:07] this day I wish I could knock all those
[57:09] doors I wish I could Rinat them and tell
[57:12] them that I was wrong I can't do that
[57:14] all I can do is come forward to you
[57:16] today and tell you I sincerely I'm sorry
[57:19] I really am I heart
[57:20] [Applause]
[57:26] thank you for this this is such a great
[57:28] honor thank you thank you thank you
[57:31] [Applause]
[57:33] it's been said but I love is love love
[57:35] is love thank you so much
[57:40] we're less than two months out from the
[57:42] love loud festival which is super
[57:44] intimidating and scary for a million
[57:47] reasons because it feels like we're
[57:48] still just getting stuff together and
[57:51] just say take one take one I'm here to
[57:53] make a very special announcement on
[57:54] August 26th in the Provo area we're
[57:58] gonna be putting on a concert called
[58:00] love loud so with love loud we knew it
[58:03] was important to be in Utah I don't want
[58:05] to say that people were intentionally
[58:08] trying to curb this event we can give
[58:11] him a sponsorship like but when we
[58:12] started realizing it was a lot of people
[58:14] being afraid to touch this issue I
[58:16] thought we have a massive park we're
[58:20] gonna show that the whole state of Utah
[58:21] actually believes in this the reality
[58:25] hitting me is that not all of Utah wants
[58:28] this I had tons of people who were like
[58:31] you shouldn't talk about how we have
[58:33] like any issues with suicide let's not
[58:37] talk about that
[58:38] Wilner stephen click on the comments
[58:40] section of the answer here I know many
[58:42] LGBTQ x-y-z people and while I treat
[58:45] them like any other person I know I
[58:47] don't agree with their choices to live
[58:49] that lifestyle people might laugh
[58:51] because they might say like why is this
[58:53] straight white guy the poster child for
[58:56] this now I don't know people have to
[58:59] hate you know so we'll see what happens
[59:01] get your imagine dragons music because
[59:03] Dan Reynolds embraced the pause poz I
[59:07] had no idea what that was so I googled
[59:09] that gay slang willing to have sex with
[59:12] someone who is HIV positive by someone
[59:14] who is not you start to feel upset that
[59:19] it's like so blatantly on obviously look
[59:23] how obvious this is like of course we
[59:25] have to love and accept everybody come
[59:27] on guys
[59:28] it's a terrible challenge to go into
[59:32] this intersection of LGBTQ individuals
[59:34] and communities of faith which requires
[59:39] sensitivity on both sides and a lot of
[59:41] nuance and that is not an easy spot to
[59:45] be when you're someone like Dan
[59:48] you know I just did an interview with
[59:50] billboards and my family saw it and
[59:52] that's been a little difficult feeling
[59:55] like the family thinks that I'm doing
[59:56] something wrong or I'm like making them
[59:58] look like bigots or something that's
[60:00] that's been probably the hardest thing
[60:02] for me the risk is that in going to this
[60:06] vulnerable intersection I'm not just I
[60:07] want to help LGBT individuals have more
[60:10] peace and love and acceptance their
[60:11] lives but I'm gonna have an event in
[60:12] Provo Utah and I'm going to talk about
[60:15] Mormon doctrine will you express it in a
[60:18] way that sounds like kicking somebody
[60:21] when they're down or throwing a stone or
[60:23] will it come across as someone that's
[60:25] putting his arms around his fellow
[60:27] brothers and sisters and saying hey
[60:29] let's do better
[60:30] it makes the family nervous but I love
[60:34] Dan know he wants to do good I know he's
[60:36] trying to be good and I know he means
[60:38] well
[60:57] [Music]
[61:05] [Music]
[61:10] [Music]
[61:17] it's follow you down burning sky fees
[61:29] there is a week in particular where
[61:32] everything with love loud was basically
[61:34] falling apart
[61:36] was so much more difficult but let me
[61:40] just say hey let's all meet this part is
[61:42] stay and do something as of yesterday
[61:44] our whole team we have together was kind
[61:47] of feeling like we needed to cancel the
[61:48] event was just making it impossible to
[62:01] put weight on my feeling the Sun will
[62:11] turn
[62:12] what would I burn I am upon with the
[62:16] urine so many voices
[62:22] [Music]
[62:22] [Applause]
[62:35] [Music]
[62:42] what do i do where do I turn even my
[62:47] scream system that was on a phone call
[63:07] with one of my fundraisers just going
[63:13] over a bunch of details on my phone my
[63:16] phone kept ringing I looked down and my
[63:19] mom then she called again and then she
[63:24] called it a third time and at that point
[63:27] I realize I need to need to talk to my
[63:28] mom and so I just said hey I need Edna's
[63:33] calling you I need to call my mom and I
[63:35] called my mom and she was hysterical
[63:46] [Music]
[63:48] you told me my brother Landon and just
[63:51] hung himself
[63:58] in Provo in place of you I paid the
[64:07] strong with a color cyan the blue and
[64:11] share our Cougars a BYU
[64:13] Oh rah rah so Landon was attending BYU
[64:17] the LDS Church's University he also had
[64:22] a really cool girlfriend and he had kind
[64:26] of blossomed down there and then he and
[64:29] his girlfriend they had sex which is
[64:31] against the honor code Landon was honest
[64:35] with the University and explained what
[64:37] had happened and told them and they said
[64:42] you're kicked out for five years and you
[64:46] can't associate with any of your
[64:48] professors you're done it's hard to put
[64:53] him into a downward spiral of depression
[64:54] and emotional wound after emotional
[64:57] wound it was it was hard for him even
[65:00] though in the eyes of his is God he was
[65:03] clean in the culture there he wasn't he
[65:06] was just a sinner and that's how a lot
[65:09] of people looked at him as less than he
[65:14] just felt worthless this was really hard
[65:20] because night after night day after day
[65:26] I'm spending all my time trying to bring
[65:29] this trying to bring this festival to
[65:31] life to save lives and to help people
[65:34] not feel alone it breaks my heart
[65:50] knowing that Landon got to a point where
[65:52] he believed that the only way his soul
[65:53] could go on was for it to leave his body
[65:57] and the harsh reality is that I mean
[66:01] here in Utah the leading cause of death
[66:03] for teenagers a suicide I think we all
[66:10] can agree that we need to find a
[66:12] solution to this it's gonna take every
[66:15] single one of us in this room to make a
[66:18] difference I believe and I know that
[66:25] Mormons are good people that we have
[66:30] sincere hearts that were not no less
[66:35] broken than any other society but the
[66:41] way that our culture is failing right
[66:43] now is in a very unique way and in a
[66:47] deadly way
[66:51] the shaming that happens in this culture
[66:55] needs to end I believe in a higher power
[66:58] and I believe in goodness and love and I
[67:01] know we can do this this isn't some
[67:03] insurmountable task it's feasible
[67:07] because I believe in us
[67:10] [Music]
[67:16] and I responded to them and I said Lance
[67:18] I'm so sorry that your brother just get
[67:21] it suits [ __ ] you don't have to do this
[67:23] anymore you know you don't have to be on
[67:26] these calls please like go take off time
[67:28] with your family like you can like all
[67:31] do love loud and you keep just refuses
[67:36] he texts when he says I'm gonna be with
[67:41] my family for a few days but we'll still
[67:44] be working on everything and want you to
[67:46] know we will make it happen no one
[67:49] deserves to feel the way my mother does
[67:50] right now and I'm going to work my
[67:52] hardest to ensure that the suicide
[67:54] epidemic ends man this is so long it has
[67:57] to stop
[67:58] I know you're stressing about this
[67:59] festival but I assure you
[68:01] we're going to pull this off there are
[68:03] too many things going right love loud is
[68:05] going to happen it's going to change the
[68:07] world
[68:08] he just said we're gonna do this damn we
[68:11] can do this I have an idea let's do it
[68:15] grassroots we don't you just get a bunch
[68:17] of money we don't need to dumb it down
[68:19] or clean it up or make it more vanilla
[68:21] to get sponsors you know you told me on
[68:24] the phone but if we didn't get the money
[68:26] we go stand in a park soapbox and just
[68:31] scream to the world that things needed
[68:33] to change in Utah one we want it to be a
[68:35] safe space for everybody to come out and
[68:37] be able to feel the love and acceptance
[68:41] together for LGBTQ and
[68:43] want them to hear it with resounding
[68:44] cries from all across Utah we went from
[68:48] the event not happening to me begging
[68:52] people to take it on we have the chance
[68:55] to do something that's really powerful
[68:56] and great but it has been doing it in
[69:00] Utah has been difficult finally we got
[69:03] somebody who said okay we can do it if
[69:05] we do it in this ballpark and we're
[69:07] gonna have to set it up the morning of
[69:09] so we need a small stage you can roll in
[69:11] a mutual love of music is a great way to
[69:13] foster love understanding and acceptance
[69:15] that's how our next guest wants to
[69:17] support the LGBTQ community
[69:20] it's basically come together in such a
[69:22] crazy last-minute way that every single
[69:25] person told me that I was stupid doing
[69:27] it
[69:53] [Music]
[69:55] yeah I guess I've never thought about
[69:58] how big the churches versus the band how
[70:01] influential the churches versus the band
[70:02] I guess if I really stand back and look
[70:04] at it it's like the band reaches
[70:06] millions millions and we put out a video
[70:09] and it's like five hundred million views
[70:17] we have a show in November in Salt Lake
[70:22] City that sold out and it sold out super
[70:25] fast it's twenty thousand people plus we
[70:29] figured oh well we do this love loud
[70:30] it's just gonna sell out and so when we
[70:33] put up the tickets it's just nowhere
[70:35] near selling as fast as and imagine
[70:37] dragons show sells I mean that tells you
[70:40] everything you need to know in order for
[70:42] Mormons to feel safe to come to this
[70:45] the truth is Mormons will feel safe
[70:49] about something when the Prophet says to
[70:52] feel safe about something we know that
[70:55] there are conversations going on in the
[70:58] hierarchy of the church
[70:59] I don't know fully what they look like I
[71:02] hope that the church is able to make a
[71:04] statement and to let people know that
[71:07] these conversations are okay to have if
[71:10] the Prophet said hey love loud is cool
[71:16] then that's would be incredible and that
[71:20] would shift that would be like
[71:22] everything I could ever hope for for me
[71:25] that is a bridge that has never been
[71:28] like that is not a bridge that that has
[71:32] been created it would be the most
[71:35] amazing huge step of progress if the
[71:38] church says hey there's this LGBTQ event
[71:40] and yeah even the guy who's behind it
[71:42] doesn't believe that it's a sin to be
[71:44] gay and there's a stamp of approval like
[71:47] that to me I'm like amazing be amazing
[71:50] so yeah I've just I've been waiting on
[71:52] pins and needles to see if they're gonna
[71:55] come through with a proposal and
[71:58] I hope it's sooner rather than later do
[72:12] you know what daddy is doing what so
[72:15] daddy's putting on a festival because he
[72:19] wants people to understand that that do
[72:26] you know what being gay is remember how
[72:29] we talked about how like boys can love
[72:32] boys and girls can love girls or they
[72:34] can love girls can love boys their voice
[72:36] can love girls and sometimes what please
[72:44] want to be girls and girls wanna be boys
[72:46] and then what can happen remember I told
[72:48] you sometimes people can be mean to that
[72:50] person yeah yeah and so we have to be
[72:53] protect that person huh yeah
[72:56] so the festival is called love loud
[73:00] because it means love everybody no
[73:04] matter what
[73:09] I saw something on your phone so it's
[73:11] better read it it's 10:30 p.m. 10:30
[73:16] p.m. we're just about to go to bed and

[73:35] applaud the love it's long jeez ah quo
[73:38] we applaud the love love festival for
[73:42] LGBTQ youths first of all I've never
[73:44] heard the church say LGBTQ it's always
[73:47] they say same-sex attraction I've never
[73:49] this is that's I've never ever heard
[73:52] them say that we applaud the love love
[73:57] festivals the festival for LGBTQ youth

[74:03] teen safety and to express respect and
[74:06] love for all of God's children we join
[74:09] our voice with all who come together to
[74:11] foster a community of inclusion in which
[74:14] no one is mistreated because of who they
[74:17] are or what they believe who they are
[74:23] thanks Sharon beliefs among them the
[74:26] priceless nosov our youth and the value
[74:28] of families we earnestly hope this
[74:31] festival and others other related
[74:33] efforts can build respectful
[74:35] communication better understanding and
[74:37] civility as we all learn from each other
[74:46] that's really great big it's a step it's
[74:54] pretty awesome
[75:19] [Music]
[75:32] this is the reality of life dan and I
[75:36] both have nerves and we're like nervous
[75:38] but I just think that there's some sort
[75:40] of a deeper feeling of just like I feel
[75:44] like this is the kind of stuff that life
[75:46] is really the purpose of it all so
[75:49] there's like a real gratification in
[75:52] actually pulling something like this off
[75:54] even though it hasn't been pulled off

[81:36] old 8 year old Mormon boy I was so
[81:38] afraid I might be gay because if I was

[81:44] family so much
[81:47] that 7 year old boy the flash Lord has
[81:51] seen tonight with 20,000 Mormons here
[81:55] celebrating us I would have had more
[81:57] hope for the future and I hope that that
[82:00] the 7 and 8 year old queer kids out
[82:02] there will feel hope for their future I
[82:06] need some more time a couple last year's
[82:10] few more days before I disappear thank
[82:17] you
[82:38] give a lovely advance welcome to
[82:41] Savannah and her mother Heather
[82:54] I was invited here to share my truth
[82:57] thanks to you for giving me the space to
[83:00] speak today I believe I was made the way
[83:03] I am all parts of me by my heavenly
[83:05] parents they did not mess up when they
[83:08] gave me brown eyes or and I was born
[83:10] bald they did not mess up when they gave
[83:13] me freckles or when I was made to be gay
[83:15] I want to love myself and not feel shame
[83:36] and I know my Heavenly parents of it
[83:39] except me
[83:42] [Applause]
[83:55] [Music]
[83:55] [Applause]
[83:59] it's quite a privilege to be able to
[84:00] share your voice 15 years ago I was a
[84:03] student at BYU and I was coming out and
[84:05] I was suicidal and I'm here and I just
[84:08] got this hug from this little girl who
[84:09] stood up just 13 and she just told
[84:12] everybody that God loves her because he
[84:14] made her I mean it took me until I was
[84:16] almost 30 to have that in my brain say I
[84:19] don't have to be better or trying to be
[84:22] better God made me exactly who I am I'm
[84:25] the best I can be I'm exactly exactly
[84:28] one said I made you so it's just been
[84:31] the most amazing day I feel like I'm in
[84:34] a dream right now
[84:39] [Music]
[84:50] it feels like Mormon Woodstock that's
[84:54] how I feel it feels like it feels like a
[84:57] historic moment really it feels like we
[85:01] we fought so hard for so long and
[85:03] finally were able to do something
[85:05] significant we've reached critical mass
[85:07] a scripture I cherish says of God that
[85:11] he invited all to come unto Him and
[85:14] partake of his goodness and all are
[85:16] alike unto Him made this be a new
[85:20] beginning for all of us that this
[85:22] community may hereafter be known as a
[85:24] place of love for all
[85:27] [Applause]
[85:29] [Music]
[85:36] the church did endorse this right yeah
[85:38] that was great
[85:39] but now for me I want them to put their
[85:41] money where their mouth is if they're
[85:43] gonna say we love all of our LGBT people
[85:45] then let's get rid of that policy and
[85:47] let's bring them into full fellowship I
[85:50] mean for me personally nothing less will
[85:52] do because you can say I love you all
[85:54] you want but until you act on that in a
[85:57] way that feels inclusive and complete
[86:00] then it's it's a no-go I totally get
[86:05] where people are coming from where they
[86:06] say like it's a big step it's historic
[86:09] but they're approving of anything LGBT
[86:13] related but I don't know I'm a little
[86:16] salty because there's still a policy
[86:19] intact and it doesn't take away from
[86:20] everyone that the pain that I went
[86:22] through like that policy caused me to
[86:26] completely go through faith crisis I've
[86:28] you know had suicidality this last year
[86:31] like I don't know where I fit in all the
[86:34] time and that's because of them
[86:37] it's a tiny step with the church it's a
[86:40] huge step for this area I'm the mother
[86:44] of a 17 year old gay son that we lost to
[86:48] suicide a year ago we work hard to
[86:51] spread the message of unconditional love
[86:53] for all of God's children so
[86:56] heartbreaking stories like mine won't
[87:00] happen again
[87:02] [Applause]
[87:05] I'm absolutely just blown away this is a
[87:08] great message to parents to say you know
[87:10] what it is okay to love your gay kids I
[87:13] think the thing is kind of hitting me
[87:15] the most is uh
[87:29] I know stock is really
[87:34] it's really proud
[87:38] he would be he's got they're just
[87:42] probably dancing with the club he did
[87:49] he's loving us
[87:51] [Applause]

[87:56] [Applause]
[87:59] [Music]
[88:01] [Applause]
[88:06] [Music]
[88:16] you have to know how much it means to me
[88:19] personally in my heart to play this
[88:23] event put my band near trees on the
[88:27] stage in front of this crowd
[88:39] being an openly gay man performing with
[88:43] my band up here should speak volumes
[88:45] I am happy I'm proud I'm open I have
[88:49] friends and family that love me and you
[88:51] will too
[88:52] [Applause]
[88:58] it started with
[88:59] [Applause]

[93:03] [Music]
[93:31] [Music]
[93:45] love loud was everything we could have
[93:48] hoped for and more
[93:50] it showed it's not just me as a Mormon
[93:54] who is antsy for change the whole Mormon
[94:01] community came out and droves to say
[94:03] this is a place within the church that
[94:06] is broken how can we fix it
[94:10] leading up to love loud the church
[94:13] obviously reached out to me and we have
[94:16] been having kind of an open dialogue
[94:18] coming out of love loud everybody was
[94:21] feeling positive momentum I had been
[94:25] extremely excited for General Conference
[94:27] and General Conference happens twice a
[94:30] year it's where the Apostles and the
[94:32] prophets speak like on live television
[94:35] to the world and to all the Mormons and
[94:39] I think a lot of Mormons myself were
[94:43] waiting to hear an apostle say now let's
[94:48] start to do something to change this
[94:50] members of the Church of Jesus Christ of
[94:53] latter-day saints are blessed with
[94:55] unique doctrine and different ways of
[94:59] viewing the world we've witnessed a
[95:02] rapid and increasing public acceptance
[95:04] of cohabitation without marriage and
[95:07] same-sex marriage elder Oaks talked
[95:10] about the family proclamation which is
[95:12] basically an old piece that was put
[95:15] together from the church that was
[95:17] released about marriage between a man
[95:19] and a woman and these are the things
[95:22] that make up a good healthy family the
[95:24] family proclamation begins by declaring
[95:26] that marriage between a man
[95:29] woman is ordained of God and that the
[95:32] family is central to the creator's plan
[95:35] for the eternal destiny of his children
[95:39] it also affirms that gender is an
[95:43] essential characteristic of individual
[95:45] premortal mortal and eternal identity
[95:48] and purpose the church basically just
[95:51] doubled down on everything they've been
[95:54] pounding into my head and Mormons heads
[95:58] for years which is to be gay and act
[96:02] upon it is a sin marriage is between man
[96:05] and a woman popular culture popular
[96:08] people will try to tell you otherwise
[96:11] every generation has its tests in its
[96:14] chance to stand and prove itself I
[96:16] believe our attitude toward and use of
[96:20] the family proclamation is one of those
[96:22] tests for this generation I pray for all
[96:26] latter-day saints to stand firm in that
[96:29] test in light of love loud that for me
[96:36] was a dark day to say the least is a
[96:40] dark week a dark month
[96:43] [Music]
[96:51] [Music]
[96:53] with that being said if there's one
[96:56] thing my Mormon values have taught me
[96:57] since I was young things first I must
[97:00] say all the words inside my head I'm
[97:03] fired up and tired of the way things
[97:06] have been oh it's that no matter what
[97:10] the world says about who you are what
[97:13] you believe still do it a hundred
[97:16] percent that spirit was the spirit that
[97:20] carried me through my mission I felt
[97:21] like I was baring my truth regardless of
[97:27] what anybody thought about me that's all
[97:29] because of Mormonism and my parents and
[97:31] so they have all prepped me for this
[97:35] moment now hey you made me a you made me
[97:38] a believer believer pain you break me
[97:45] down you build me a believer believer a
[97:52] determined Mormon was a scary thing I
[97:54] will tell you that because they don't
[97:58] stop I knocked a hundred doors to get
[98:02] into one door I knocked thousands of
[98:05] doors on my mission
[98:07] there's one thing I can guarantee is
[98:10] that I will continue to knock this door
[98:13] until somebody answers my life my love
[98:16] my drive it came from you made me uh he
[98:21] made me a believer believe
[98:25] [Music]
[98:28] you
[98:40] you
[98:44] [Music]
[98:53] wake up live alone
[98:58] to
[99:00] [Music]
[99:05] because of love loud my dad felt like he
[99:08] had the permission to love and accept me
[99:10] for who I am and love loud gave us a
[99:14] bonding and that I am really grateful
[99:18] for it gave me the guts to talk about my
[99:21] son sexuality in ways that I'd never
[99:23] been able to before I've had four people
[99:25] come out to me since love loud they said
[99:27] that love loud gave them the courage to
[99:29] live their truth love loud gave me the
[99:32] opportunity to tell my story and declare
[99:35] that I am worth it in front of thousands
[99:38] of people love loud gave my family the
[99:41] chance to stand shoulder to shoulder
[99:43] with our transgender son and not only
[99:46] him but with neighbors and extended
[99:48] family who never would have ever showed
[99:51] up for an LGBT event love love gave me
[99:54] hope and inspiration that things can
[99:56] change that I myself can be a force for
[99:59] good in my own community looking at this
[100:01] crowd of thousands of people I realized
[100:03] these are people I don't have to be
[100:05] scared of there's a lot of support in my
[100:08] community that I didn't realize was
[100:09] there and it was honestly one of the
[100:13] best days of my life when I was 13 14 I
[100:16] felt completely isolated and silenced
[100:19] and it hasn't even been that long and I
[100:22] just feel so hopeful
[100:25] about the future and that things will
[100:29] just keep getting better and I hope it
[100:33] does
