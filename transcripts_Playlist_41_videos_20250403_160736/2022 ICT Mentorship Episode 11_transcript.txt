[00:05] all right folks welcome back
[00:07] a little bit earlier broadcast today
[00:11] has some plans this evening so i want to
[00:12] get it out of the way
[00:14] all right so we're looking at
[00:16] obviously a hindsight view of something
[00:18] i
[00:19] pointed to before it happened so that
[00:21] way you guys got a chance to see what it
[00:23] was like for
[00:25] my private mentorship group when i say
[00:27] these things it's almost like an
[00:29] invitation for some of you to email me
[00:32] to ask to join out you can't join it
[00:33] okay i'm teaching mentorship
[00:36] on youtube okay so that way
[00:38] you don't need to reach out to me okay
[00:41] it's
[00:41] i'm teaching right here and you didn't
[00:43] have to send me any credit card
[00:45] information you'd have to set up any
[00:46] kind of paypal account
[00:48] there's nothing to worry about
[00:50] you either watch it and enjoy it and get
[00:52] something from it or you never come back
[00:53] and watch anymore okay it's very simple
[00:56] but i'm getting a lot of feedback from
[00:58] the comments and it's been very positive
[00:59] so thank you for that
[01:01] it's very encouraging all right so we're
[01:03] looking at the
[01:04] e-mini nasdaq futures contract for the
[01:07] march delivery
[01:09] if you remember
[01:11] i was outlining this imbalance in here
[01:14] okay and i gave you the high of this
[01:16] candle below that candle which it should
[01:18] be
[01:18] sitting right on that
[01:21] so
[01:22] with this imbalance
[01:24] we traded down to a discount back up to
[01:27] a premium
[01:28] again measure the high
[01:30] to the low and i'll do that for you now
[01:31] because i know somebody like can you
[01:32] just do it for me
[01:40] all right so here's 50 that's
[01:42] equilibrium inside this dealing range
[01:44] high
[01:45] and low
[01:46] so we traded from these lows up into a
[01:49] premium above 50
[01:52] below 50 is a discount up here we tried
[01:55] to rally up above this high failed broke
[01:57] back down below 50 percent
[01:59] and then created a gap
[02:02] okay so it comes up back into a premium
[02:04] market above 50
[02:05] and fills in the gap i mentioned how
[02:09] this type of retracement
[02:12] can lull traders into likely thinking
[02:14] it's going to go higher
[02:16] but we're thinking down here okay the
[02:19] liquidity resting below here is what
[02:20] they're going to attack
[02:22] so all of this consolidation just sets
[02:24] up another selling opportunity to run
[02:26] down there
[02:27] and again you're welcome to go back and
[02:28] listen to the previous discussions
[02:30] and you'll hear me basically say that
[02:31] we're going down here
[02:34] all right so it needs to rebalance this
[02:37] first and it spends three days in that
[02:39] range
[02:40] notice that
[02:42] then
[02:43] it releases the downside attacks the
[02:44] cell side here
[02:46] and trades into the cell cell liquidity
[02:48] resting below here
[02:50] so let's go into a lower time frame
[02:52] hourly chart
[02:53] and fared out some more information and
[02:55] details all right so here is the hourly
[02:57] chart you can see that high end of the
[02:59] fair value gap and the low end of the
[03:01] favorite gap we traded up into that sold
[03:04] off
[03:05] consolidated
[03:06] sold off once more
[03:09] and you watched
[03:10] me share
[03:11] on the community tab
[03:13] my live trades from
[03:15] yesterday it was traded through td
[03:17] ameritrade it was not a
[03:19] demo account okay
[03:21] so
[03:22] i want to go into what i used
[03:25] what i saw and then obviously
[03:28] i'll show you in the account
[03:29] where the details were okay
[03:32] all right so the market started trading
[03:37] rallied up took out a short-term high on
[03:39] friday
[03:41] see that
[03:42] then started the breakdown now the
[03:44] overnight i was watching this but i was
[03:47] hoping that it didn't take out
[03:49] that low before the morning i wanted to
[03:51] see it trade up here take the high out
[03:54] and then consolidate after running below
[03:56] that short term low i didn't want it to
[03:57] be in a hurry before the new york
[03:59] session in the morning because that
[04:01] would have set up a nice short up here
[04:02] where i could have taken a run under
[04:05] this low and then see if i can capture a
[04:07] re-entry
[04:09] which is the entry you'll actually see
[04:10] me do
[04:12] and then
[04:13] the drop down in here now on monday it
[04:15] was a bank holiday and trading stops at
[04:18] one o'clock in the afternoon on holidays
[04:20] generally
[04:21] and resumes around six o'clock in the
[04:22] afternoon new york time
[04:25] and when we stopped here we had already
[04:27] moved aggressively lower and stopped
[04:29] right there so i felt very strongly that
[04:31] we were going to gap down below it and
[04:33] it gave just a beautiful
[04:35] gap lower and run immediately
[04:37] but i was
[04:39] looking at the 13 5 ninety thirteen five
[04:42] eighty six level
[04:44] real time and i couldn't get to my
[04:46] screen fast enough
[04:48] to close it out there
[04:50] and i didn't wanna put a limit order in
[04:53] because if it got really far down below
[04:55] and started running you know really
[04:56] lower
[04:57] with a lot of speed and such i didn't
[04:59] want to limit my
[05:01] profitable
[05:02] exit with having a limit order in so i
[05:04] just left it open-ended
[05:06] and i wanted to see how far it would
[05:07] reach down in there by the time i closed
[05:09] the trade it closed me at thirteen
[05:11] thousand six twelve and a quarter so my
[05:13] entry was thirteen thousand eight fifty
[05:15] eight and a quarter the exit was
[05:17] thirteen thousand six twelve and a
[05:18] quarter
[05:19] that's not
[05:20] a little bit of ticks okay 204 some plus
[05:25] handles so
[05:27] you take that 240 sum
[05:29] times that by four there's your tick
[05:31] value for those like to keep counting
[05:32] them
[05:35] you're going to drop down into a 15
[05:36] minute time frame
[05:44] all right so
[05:46] we had that run on
[05:48] friday's high here
[05:52] to break down
[05:53] and at 10 30 in the morning
[05:55] 10 33 was the actual fill so it's right
[05:58] in that candle
[06:01] right in here
[06:04] i'm trading in that candle going short
[06:07] so we're going to go into the details
[06:08] and look at why that was the case
[06:10] and again
[06:12] you'll see the live account log in in
[06:14] the business okay so just hold on to
[06:16] your horses if that's the attitude you
[06:18] have right now oh you in the hindsight
[06:21] so we're going to go into a
[06:23] five-minute chart start going down
[06:26] into
[06:31] the details here
[06:37] this is a little bit taller so that way
[06:38] you can appreciate the imbalances that
[06:41] are being shown
[06:43] all right so we had
[06:44] this rally up
[06:47] which in my mind was acting like a judah
[06:49] swing in the morning
[06:50] okay so here's 8 30
[06:52] it starts to run higher
[06:54] so i want to be in
[06:56] going short
[06:58] at this candles opening
[07:01] and you can see that well maybe you
[07:02] can't see it
[07:04] the opening price over here okay
[07:06] here is 8 30's candle right there
[07:11] the opening at 13 7 98 and a half
[07:15] so i want to be preferably going short
[07:17] something above that
[07:18] price
[07:19] okay so i'm anticipating further
[07:21] weakness
[07:23] and before i go any further in this one
[07:26] i got several people
[07:28] probably about
[07:29] half a dozen or so
[07:31] mentioning
[07:32] their confusion with why i mentioned the
[07:34] opening price at new york at midnight
[07:36] and in the opening price at 8 30 in the
[07:38] morning
[07:40] there's two
[07:41] reference points being specifically
[07:43] dealt with there
[07:44] if you're looking at the entire daily
[07:46] range you're going to use the opening
[07:47] price at midnight
[07:49] but if you're going to be looking at the
[07:50] morning session
[07:51] you're going to be looking at the 8 30
[07:53] in the morning opening price
[07:54] okay so hopefully it's made a
[07:56] distinction there don't worry i have a
[07:58] market structured lesson coming up on
[07:59] thursday that will further solidify and
[08:02] remove all doubts and concerns about
[08:03] that okay but for now let's just go
[08:05] through this one
[08:07] so 8 30 in the morning the opening price
[08:09] i'm bearish i'm thinking we're going to
[08:10] go down below that green level there
[08:12] that's the old daily low
[08:15] so
[08:17] on this candle here at 8 30 i'm
[08:18] expecting
[08:20] all this being a fake rally it's
[08:22] something to lull in traders that chase
[08:24] it going higher the retracement people
[08:27] that don't really understand order
[08:28] blocks they're going to say look at that
[08:29] it's a down closed candle i'm going to
[08:31] buy that and then when it starts to go
[08:32] up like that they feel wow this is
[08:34] really easy every down closed candle
[08:36] after a run-up is a bullshore block it's
[08:38] not
[08:40] in here is the real context okay we have
[08:42] an imbalance there
[08:44] and that's what i'm looking at i'm
[08:46] looking at this
[08:51] imbalance right
[08:53] there so i'm trying to operate inside
[08:56] that range for a short
[08:58] now i know because of the volatility
[09:02] it can color outside the lines and it's
[09:05] okay
[09:08] the bodies of the candles are kind of
[09:10] supporting the idea of what i'm looking
[09:11] for but the wicks i could care less
[09:13] about because i want to get in when it's
[09:16] ideal and i'm going to show you what
[09:18] that was looking like for me at the time
[09:19] so we're going to drop down into
[09:21] a four-minute chart
[09:27] okay so here is that imbalance and fair
[09:29] value gap on the five-minute chart but
[09:31] now it's a little skewed because it
[09:33] takes up two candles to show that range
[09:35] the market trades up
[09:37] and
[09:38] right
[09:40] in that candle
[09:41] that one right there that's where i'm
[09:43] going short i got in at 10 33 okay that
[09:45] was my short
[09:47] dropping down into a
[09:49] three minute chart
[09:56] okay the market trades up
[09:58] works inside that imbalance and right
[10:00] there 10 33 that candle
[10:03] when it's starting to bump up against
[10:05] the top end of that fair value got right
[10:07] there
[10:08] as it hits that and starts to move away
[10:10] i'm in there
[10:11] i'm going short right there
[10:13] the reason why i'm trusting that
[10:15] and not thinking it's going to go higher
[10:17] is because we have this high here
[10:19] okay
[10:20] and then we have this high here which
[10:22] highs higher
[10:24] this one or that one
[10:26] obviously this one
[10:28] now this candle is high
[10:30] watch what happens
[10:31] from this high we have a short-term
[10:33] swing high next to it here and then we
[10:35] have one here
[10:37] so this one makes
[10:39] a intermediate term high
[10:42] so we have a long-term intraday
[10:44] on a three-minute chart which sounds
[10:45] like an oxymoron though but
[10:48] long-term high
[10:51] intermediate term high
[10:53] because this high is lower than that one
[10:55] but we have a swing high here
[10:58] and here that are lower
[11:00] both being lower than this one
[11:02] then we have the same context
[11:04] right here we have a high
[11:06] with a lower high on either side of it
[11:10] so i have market structure
[11:12] behind me showing that this is number
[11:15] one it's a bearish market because my
[11:17] draw and liquidity is down here it
[11:18] hasn't traded down there yet okay so
[11:20] it's gonna act like a big magnet
[11:22] so all these fluctuations in here
[11:23] without understanding what i'm showing
[11:25] you it's gonna feel like it's just noise
[11:27] it's chop it's not it's actually telling
[11:30] you exactly what it's going to do
[11:32] so the swing high here
[11:33] is an intermediate term swing high so i
[11:35] want to be going short real close to
[11:37] this high
[11:38] because it's likely to break like it
[11:39] does here
[11:42] so at
[11:43] 10 33
[11:45] when it hits the upper end of that fair
[11:46] value got
[11:47] i have at now at this moment
[11:50] go back one candle we have this high a
[11:53] higher high and a lower high so we have
[11:54] a high with a lower high on either side
[11:56] of it that's a swing high that is lower
[11:59] than this one
[12:01] that is lower than that one
[12:04] so
[12:06] it's far more than just oh he's just
[12:08] looking at lower lows lower highs
[12:11] that's what a
[12:13] myopic individual would come and watch
[12:15] this so like when they see me put a
[12:17] rectangle in the chart they're saying oh
[12:18] it's supply and demand it's not there's
[12:19] so many more factors involved that
[12:22] it's just not even in the same vicinity
[12:25] okay
[12:26] so
[12:28] sparing all that compare and contrast
[12:30] because i've done a lot of that already
[12:32] on the videos on this youtube channel
[12:35] the elements of intermediate term
[12:38] short-term highs
[12:40] i learned that from larry williams okay
[12:41] that
[12:43] mode of
[12:45] deciphering market structure
[12:47] he taught that
[12:50] in a video course that i bought back in
[12:52] the early 90s and it was a video course
[12:54] that i mentioned many times in this
[12:55] youtube channel
[12:57] the future millionaires confidential
[12:59] trading course
[13:01] something to that effect it was for vhs
[13:02] tapes and
[13:04] when he talked about market structure
[13:06] it
[13:07] kind of went over my head the first few
[13:09] times listening to it like i didn't
[13:10] really
[13:11] understand what he was showing until i
[13:13] started literally going into the charts
[13:15] and saying okay here's a swing high and
[13:16] this is how you learn it okay because
[13:18] trust me
[13:19] watching this video
[13:21] or watching someone else parrot what i
[13:23] say and then say wow he did it in five
[13:25] minutes he's teaching it better that's
[13:26] not it's not jealousy me saying that i'm
[13:29] telling you you have no idea what you're
[13:31] doing you're not even teaching it
[13:32] correctly and those that believe that
[13:33] they're learning it correctly are going
[13:35] out there and wrecking themselves
[13:37] what you're looking at
[13:39] is a price chart with a
[13:42] directional bias okay something that's
[13:44] leading to a draw on liquidity so i've
[13:47] already told you last week that we were
[13:49] going to go below that green line
[13:51] that's where we were heading
[13:52] so what you're doing is you're looking
[13:55] at
[13:56] all the swing highs
[13:58] and every time you see a swing high on a
[13:59] song high is simply a high that has a
[14:01] lower high candle to the left of it and
[14:03] a lower high candle to the right of it
[14:05] and then one in the middle that's your
[14:06] swing high
[14:08] note that okay in the old days when we
[14:10] printed out our charts and such and we
[14:12] had chart books delivered to us we would
[14:14] get them once a week they would give us
[14:16] the friday's closing data and all the
[14:18] daily candles and then until we got our
[14:21] new updated chart book
[14:23] we had to hand draw in the open high low
[14:25] and close
[14:26] on the charts when the markets say we
[14:28] were following
[14:29] so
[14:31] whenever we saw a swing high or swing
[14:33] low we would just put a little ring
[14:34] above it little circle okay like a
[14:36] little halo
[14:37] and that would be
[14:39] a short term high
[14:40] now
[14:41] i would do a double
[14:43] circle or double halo for an
[14:45] intermediate term high
[14:47] and then three halos for a long term
[14:50] swing high
[14:51] so that way when i'm looking at price it
[14:53] allows me to
[14:56] classify
[14:57] the level of
[14:59] high that is forming
[15:01] so it's not just
[15:02] lower low low or high no you got to look
[15:04] at the nesting effect of the highs and
[15:07] lows and again that concept i learned
[15:09] from larry williams in the early 90s he
[15:11] talks a little bit about it in
[15:13] his book how i made a million dollar
[15:15] trading commodities last year which i
[15:16] believe is absolutely still essential
[15:18] reading even though there's a lot of
[15:19] things in that book i think is just
[15:21] fluff and just like all the moon phases
[15:23] and things i'm not into all that stuff
[15:25] but his
[15:27] chapters on
[15:29] market structure and
[15:31] his million dollar trading concepts
[15:34] those ideas and that premise behind it
[15:36] they are still true today and they
[15:38] probably will always be true so
[15:41] if you don't have that book my
[15:43] recommendation is to get it
[15:45] go and get it where we can i'm not going
[15:46] to put any kind of affiliate links up
[15:47] that way you can't think i'm making any
[15:49] money
[15:50] by showing his uh his books i just think
[15:53] it's a really good book and at least
[15:54] once a year i go through and read it
[15:55] just for nostalgia reasons but i got it
[15:58] pretty much remembered
[16:00] verbatim
[16:02] but by looking at that relationship of
[16:04] the highs
[16:06] i trusted this because we had a swing
[16:09] high here already in effect and i know
[16:11] this candle here is not likely to go
[16:12] above this one because this one didn't
[16:14] go above that one and this one didn't go
[16:15] above that one
[16:17] not because it's
[16:18] lower lows and lower highs there's much
[16:21] more going on
[16:22] underneath
[16:24] the the surface than just lower lows and
[16:26] lower highs that's just
[16:30] it's cringy when you hear people talk
[16:32] like that and they try to reduce it down
[16:33] to something like that or it's a support
[16:35] resistance idea it's just by the floor
[16:37] and sell the ceiling okay or why does an
[16:40] ict look at this trade over here
[16:41] industry because those trades are being
[16:44] referred to in hindsight by those people
[16:45] that talk like that
[16:47] i'm literally taking live trades i'm
[16:48] taking them i'm executing on them and i
[16:50] know why i'm doing it i'm not guessing
[16:52] i'm not trying to figure out or
[16:54] deciphering what it is after i get into
[16:56] trade i know what i'm looking for and i
[16:58] know why i'm waiting for it
[17:00] that is something that you learn by
[17:04] developing patients and trusting a model
[17:07] the only way you trust it is to go
[17:09] through back testing look at all these
[17:11] price action moves
[17:13] and start classifying the swing highs
[17:14] and swing lows i will amplify what i
[17:16] just talked about here on thursday's
[17:18] lesson okay because thursday's lesson is
[17:20] going to be on market structure okay i'm
[17:21] going to teach a lot of people out there
[17:22] to think they know market structure they
[17:24] don't really know that much at all
[17:25] actually but
[17:27] if this is
[17:29] the candle i'm trying to get in at
[17:31] and i execute on with all the
[17:33] understanding of this outline there
[17:36] i want to see displacement
[17:38] we get it here
[17:40] now if i didn't take this trade here
[17:42] i could trade with the return back to
[17:44] this right here why
[17:47] why is that possible
[17:49] we have a swing high
[17:51] it's broken to the upside
[17:54] this low
[17:56] is taken out here
[17:59] this candle is high here
[18:02] if it touches that again i can be short
[18:03] there
[18:05] just using the imbalance
[18:07] in the fair value gap entry technique
[18:09] i'm teaching you
[18:11] so
[18:11] i can go there and get short or i want
[18:14] to get up here as close as i can
[18:17] to that important high that i've already
[18:19] outlined here
[18:21] so i want to be in that
[18:23] and wait for that initial move because
[18:24] then when this occurs
[18:27] when you're that high up in the
[18:31] well the session high
[18:34] so at 8 30
[18:36] right there this run up
[18:39] i'm real close to this high
[18:41] by entering there
[18:42] notice that
[18:44] i'm not waiting for a breakout below
[18:45] that low
[18:48] so i'm getting up in there where
[18:50] it's
[18:53] an optimal entry
[18:56] i don't need to get the highest high
[18:58] you don't need to get the highest high
[19:00] but you need to understand why it should
[19:02] be trading away from the levels you're
[19:04] trying to enter at
[19:06] and that's kind of like what i'm showing
[19:07] you here i'm hinting at a deeper lesson
[19:09] i'll give you on thursday
[19:11] but the displacement comes
[19:13] which is what i was waiting for and it
[19:15] gives you a confirmation when this
[19:16] occurs it's just almost like okay just
[19:18] sit back and just relax and just let it
[19:20] do its thing
[19:21] now monday again was a holiday so i knew
[19:23] i had abbreviated session hours so it's
[19:26] going to close at one o'clock so that's
[19:30] right in here
[19:34] and then next candle obviously would be
[19:36] one o'clock and it's not trading so it
[19:37] closed
[19:39] but it closed here ahead of one o'clock
[19:41] and then
[19:43] the holiday session closing at 1 pm in
[19:45] new york local time
[19:47] and the low that green level here
[19:50] remember go back to the daily chart at
[19:51] the beginning of the video and what we
[19:52] were referring to last week
[19:54] the liquidity the cell stops below this
[19:58] green line that's where it was going to
[19:59] attack
[20:00] okay
[20:02] and it came in
[20:04] and did so it opened up six o'clock in
[20:07] new york time opened up and slammed down
[20:10] accelerating lower
[20:12] that
[20:13] is the move that you want to see
[20:16] being short up here
[20:18] and covering down below here
[20:20] once it does that and it runs into it
[20:22] low deep
[20:24] that's it
[20:26] take your profits and move the sidelines
[20:27] and then wait because you have a big gap
[20:29] here
[20:30] it's likely to come back and rebalance
[20:31] that and fill it in and it does
[20:35] and then ultimately
[20:37] trades
[20:38] around that old low
[20:42] and eventually pumps up
[20:44] into the afternoon
[20:49] consolidates
[20:53] then goes into the early morning
[20:54] afternoon hours
[20:57] right there
[20:58] and i
[21:00] showed how this setup because after a
[21:03] big move
[21:05] you don't want to trade in the morning
[21:06] session
[21:07] just don't do it and i purposely go into
[21:10] a demo account to appease that desire to
[21:12] want to trade
[21:13] so i don't
[21:14] burn
[21:15] the account i don't take the
[21:18] heat off of
[21:19] a nice win
[21:21] and replace it or dampen it by taking a
[21:24] losing trade
[21:25] in my history in the last 30 years i've
[21:28] been fortunate enough to know
[21:32] how i have hurt myself
[21:34] those things are the things that i like
[21:35] to mentor with but those are also the
[21:37] lessons that everybody complains about
[21:39] until they lose money and then they come
[21:40] back to me and they're like i wish i
[21:42] would listen
[21:44] so i get it you know everybody has their
[21:46] own interpretation of what they should
[21:47] be doing how they should be learning it
[21:48] but
[21:50] you know i've lived it you're just now
[21:51] the you're learning about it
[21:53] so
[21:54] when i have a nice winning day as you'll
[21:56] see it was a nice little win
[21:58] um
[22:00] i'm not gonna hurry to go back in
[22:03] and then you have these days here
[22:05] where it can trip you up you don't know
[22:07] what's going on you don't know what's
[22:08] likely to occur
[22:10] so i went in and i demo traded and used
[22:12] again quote unquote discount broker
[22:14] leverage
[22:15] to compare and contrast those
[22:17] fellows out there that like to
[22:19] work in their market replay and
[22:21] paper trade their stuff with ninjatrader
[22:24] and then
[22:24] you know compare and contrast you know
[22:26] what i'm doing with trading view
[22:28] so
[22:30] it kind of like scratches an itch
[22:32] and it keeps me out of
[22:33] trouble with a live account because
[22:37] if you catch a good lick in the
[22:39] marketplace
[22:41] and you've had winning trades or you
[22:43] caught a really nice winning trade that
[22:45] you had to wait for the setup to pan out
[22:47] when that occurs
[22:49] if you're new you have an impulsive
[22:52] tendency to want to go back in
[22:53] immediately and get that dopamine hit
[22:55] again i i did something right you know i
[22:58] made money
[22:59] when i was a younger man
[23:01] i did that and i had some really nice
[23:03] run-ups in the account and then boom
[23:06] i get a really big winning trade
[23:09] all of a sudden
[23:10] i feel like
[23:11] it wasn't enough
[23:13] because i was so low nobody around me
[23:14] was supporting me i had no support
[23:16] structure around me none
[23:18] i didn't have anybody saying hey what
[23:19] you do is awesome
[23:21] you don't need to worry about anymore so
[23:23] it was just me saying i had to do more
[23:26] so
[23:27] one of the
[23:28] mental hurdles you're going to have to
[23:30] contend with
[23:32] is knowing when enough is enough
[23:35] and when you've made money real money in
[23:37] a live account
[23:39] you just don't want to rush to get back
[23:41] in there again you get folks out there
[23:43] that sit on social media and say you
[23:44] know you got to push your edge
[23:46] no you don't want to push your edge
[23:47] because if you keep pushing your edge
[23:50] you're gonna dull it
[23:52] you sharpen it by
[23:54] knowing when to get in when to get out
[23:56] and you don't dull your edge
[23:58] okay so when i hear people talk like
[24:00] that i already know they're not
[24:01] profitable i know they're not profitable
[24:03] because they're gamblers and they want
[24:05] to sound like they're doing something
[24:06] all the time and they're not and if they
[24:08] are they're doing it probably
[24:09] unprofitably
[24:11] so
[24:14] this morning
[24:15] after 9 30
[24:18] again what's the bias
[24:20] bearish
[24:21] that has not changed even though we had
[24:23] this run up it hasn't changed so at 9 30
[24:26] equity is open
[24:27] after consolidation
[24:30] it runs up creates a high and then runs
[24:32] up again takes out the high that right
[24:34] there is your
[24:35] run on stops
[24:37] wait to see if it wants to break down it
[24:39] does
[24:42] so we're going to look at that
[24:43] and
[24:44] refer back to the video i just put a
[24:46] little short video up uh this morning
[24:49] and outlined the whole business there i
[24:50] don't want to do it here because this is
[24:51] rehashing what i already showed in a
[24:53] very short one minute or so video
[24:56] but ultimately
[24:57] right in here
[24:58] we have a nice little selling
[25:00] opportunity
[25:01] and you can attack
[25:03] the fair value gap in here between the
[25:05] low and the high
[25:07] right there it would be and if you want
[25:08] to trade with the longer term bias you
[25:10] could attack the cell side liquidity
[25:12] resting below here and here because
[25:14] they're relative equal lows and then you
[25:16] would have got a nice fill there as well
[25:18] so
[25:20] i teach in a manner that allows my
[25:22] students to pick
[25:24] number one the style or trader they want
[25:25] to be they want to be a day trader they
[25:27] want to be a scalper do you want to be
[25:28] intraday swing trader if they want to be
[25:31] a short-term trader where you're holding
[25:32] over you know overnight or if you want
[25:35] to be a
[25:36] daily chart swing trader or four-hour
[25:39] chart swing trader where you're holding
[25:40] you for a week or more or if you want to
[25:43] do a position trader which to me is i
[25:46] don't have
[25:47] i don't have that mentality to do that i
[25:48] have too many things that show up on a
[25:50] chart that make me change my mind all
[25:52] the time
[25:53] so i have a lot more opportunities
[25:55] because i think short term and i excel
[25:57] in the short term
[25:58] it does not mean that
[26:00] that is not a profitable way of trading
[26:02] when it's position trading because i
[26:04] don't match that personality wise so
[26:07] i like to excel where i'm strongest and
[26:09] it's in intraday trading and i can
[26:12] run
[26:13] the account pretty quick with velocity i
[26:16] can get in get short-term moves and just
[26:17] parlay them out real quick which is kind
[26:19] of like what i was demonstrating
[26:21] you know facetiously this morning with
[26:22] the one minute video
[26:24] thumbing my news at the quan so we're
[26:27] looking at the
[26:29] likelihood of potentially going back
[26:30] down below that level again if it does
[26:32] it'll probably start to accelerate
[26:36] i like 13 thousand three hundred
[26:39] if we get you know on a roll going lower
[26:41] i like that one and maybe even if we get
[26:43] really excited it can trade down into
[26:44] twelve thousands okay twelve thousand
[26:46] eight fifty twelve thousand eight
[26:48] seventy five in that area so
[26:50] just something to think about i'm not
[26:52] suggesting you should take a trade in it
[26:53] or not but just
[26:54] thinking out loud uh this lesson
[26:56] obviously it was a little bit fast and
[26:58] loose and it will be a lot more
[26:59] structured on the market structured
[27:01] lesson on thursday hopefully you found
[27:02] this one insightful and i'm going to
[27:04] show you again this was a trade actually
[27:06] took with a live account
[27:09] all right so i'm going to log into my
[27:11] tdmr trade account
[27:14] and i'll show you a result of a trade i
[27:17] took
[27:19] yesterday
[27:20] i have not taken any live trades today
[27:30] again this is just the show
[27:32] real executions are being done
[27:35] i like to teach with a demo
[27:37] but just to answer the folks that are
[27:39] just
[27:40] really hardline critics or just want to
[27:41] know
[27:42] can i push the button
[27:44] push the button on ct
[27:47] all right so here is the business
[27:50] for
[27:51] uh last six days
[27:53] trading
[27:54] and again this
[27:55] account is just to show what i believe a
[27:57] student could do now right away look at
[27:59] this right here this is this is not a
[28:01] losing trade it looks like negative
[28:03] twenty seven hundred dollars and fifty
[28:04] five twenty seven fifty five what that
[28:06] is is an adjustment by the broker
[28:08] because at the time of settlement when i
[28:10] closed the trade
[28:12] it showed that i was up four thousand
[28:14] nine hundred twenty dollars and then
[28:16] because of their accounting they were
[28:17] just showing that they were reflecting a
[28:19] gain of seven thousand six hundred
[28:21] seventy five dollars which is not a
[28:22] actual realized result for me it was
[28:25] them doing their administrative side
[28:27] it's a broker thing trust me i cannot do
[28:29] anything to make that happen it's not me
[28:31] doing some funny money business okay
[28:33] anybody that trades with live funds
[28:35] they've probably seen this happen in
[28:36] their own account
[28:37] so over here you can see the executions
[28:39] yesterday
[28:40] at a scratch where i got in a little too
[28:42] early i was only ambitious and then the
[28:44] second one i wasn't sure if it was going
[28:46] to go higher or lower and just to
[28:48] appease my curiosity i threw a short end
[28:51] just to see what we get
[28:53] snapped against me a little bit
[28:55] not not much but still enough to get my
[28:57] attention and i knew what i was looking
[28:59] for so there's the short i just outlined
[29:01] in the previous portion of this video
[29:03] wrote all that down held for the gap
[29:05] opening after reopen at six o'clock and
[29:07] there is the close of the trade right
[29:09] there
[29:11] nice little dandy four thousand nine
[29:13] hundred twenty dollars fixes the
[29:16] little pinch i took on
[29:18] the one trade earlier in the day
[29:20] and the one scratch was nothing it was
[29:22] covering costs
[29:24] okay and again there's the business
[29:26] there that's the entry and that's the
[29:28] exit and there's no commission costs on
[29:29] the one above that as you can see that
[29:31] was not a trade hope you found this
[29:33] insightful until talk to you on thursday
[29:36] be safe
