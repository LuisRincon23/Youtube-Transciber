[00:05] all right folks welcome back
[00:07] a little bit of a different type of
[00:09] presentation style tonight i'm gonna be
[00:11] blending both of my communities okay i
[00:14] have a private mentorship group which i
[00:16] usually do a midweek review and
[00:18] commentary and teaching
[00:20] with on wednesday monday and friday
[00:23] and then obviously you know youtube
[00:25] mentorship group you all get a video
[00:27] from me on tuesday night
[00:29] and on thursday night
[00:31] well this is part of the video when i
[00:32] talk to my private group i do a little
[00:34] bit of jaw boning so
[00:36] bear with me because i'm trying to save
[00:38] myself a lot of time
[00:39] i went on holiday last week
[00:41] and we went down to florida did some gum
[00:44] shoe
[00:45] detective work found some interesting
[00:47] things
[00:48] and i'll bring that up in the coming
[00:50] weeks it'll be a little interesting
[00:53] but in the meantime
[00:55] i came back obviously late we had a lot
[00:57] of traffic and it delayed me i couldn't
[00:59] get back home
[01:00] to do the video for the youtube
[01:02] community
[01:03] and i got home late today and i had a
[01:06] lot of admin
[01:07] tasks to do because of mentorship and
[01:10] businesses that i'm running so
[01:13] with that said
[01:14] just know that this is not going to be a
[01:16] regular thing i'm doing it because i
[01:18] have a lot of work to do when i'm
[01:20] producing these videos
[01:21] for my private group so i am blending
[01:24] both okay so i'm gonna cover
[01:26] what i promised i was gonna cover in the
[01:29] youtube commentary
[01:30] on tuesday night but was unable to do so
[01:34] and then
[01:35] also i'm gonna
[01:37] give the private mentorship group
[01:39] their commentary and
[01:41] blend both communities together okay so
[01:43] it'll kind of give you a little bit of a
[01:46] an appreciation for just how much i
[01:49] really am teaching here
[01:51] on youtube
[01:52] okay and
[01:54] just so you know i know there's a lot of
[01:56] you that are commenting in the videos
[01:58] and you're asking how to join the
[02:00] private mentorship group and what is the
[02:02] distinction between that
[02:04] and the youtube community
[02:06] well the private mentorship group
[02:09] they get to see things before it happens
[02:11] okay and as i call moves before it
[02:13] happens i call
[02:15] analysis i break that down before it
[02:17] happens and i'll give you a little taste
[02:18] of that what was given to them on monday
[02:20] night
[02:21] and i'll use that to segue into the
[02:23] teaching that i promised i would give
[02:24] you youtube community on tuesday night
[02:26] but was unable to
[02:29] and kind of give you also a
[02:32] a preview kind of like what i'm going to
[02:34] be doing when i start doing live streams
[02:37] what do you say i see he's going to be
[02:39] doing live streams
[02:40] he said
[02:41] he said he was going to do live streams
[02:43] didn't they say he would never do that
[02:46] yep it's 2022 i'm doing everything they
[02:48] said i wouldn't do okay
[02:51] so anyway the point is i'm going to give
[02:53] you a little bit of a taste of what i'm
[02:55] going to be outlining in real time with
[02:58] intraday charts okay which is a lot
[03:00] easier because it's
[03:02] it's quicker number one
[03:04] and it won't feel quicker when you're
[03:06] watching it with me okay it's going to
[03:07] be probably me
[03:09] droning on about things while the price
[03:11] action is moving okay so i'm going to
[03:13] drive most of you that
[03:16] don't like all of my lectures where i
[03:18] have a lot of
[03:20] insight being shared and things that you
[03:23] don't think are relevant to you because
[03:24] you want to get to give me an entry
[03:26] pattern give me a targeting technique
[03:28] and that's it that's all i need
[03:30] that's not all you need okay because if
[03:31] it was that easy
[03:33] everybody would be rich but
[03:35] i understand everybody has to go through
[03:37] that growth period
[03:39] but
[03:40] when i get to that part i'll tell you
[03:41] this is the part
[03:43] where i'm gonna show you
[03:44] basically what i'm going to be doing in
[03:46] the live streams okay so
[03:48] with that
[03:50] i just want to make this point here
[03:52] because
[03:53] my private group
[03:55] you know who you are
[03:57] i have been telling you
[03:58] for over a year now to download all of
[04:00] your videos okay because the server will
[04:02] not be hosted any longer starting june
[04:05] 1st 2022
[04:07] as i mentioned we're going to be moving
[04:08] away from videos
[04:10] and we're going to forum posts only so
[04:13] everything i say usually in audio
[04:15] commentary over a video
[04:17] i'll be just simply typing out on a
[04:19] chart because you are now charter
[04:21] members so i don't need to do so much
[04:24] leg work with the audio okay or
[04:26] commentary i can point to certain things
[04:28] and you'll know exactly what i'm
[04:29] referring to what it means and what it's
[04:31] useful for
[04:33] and then obviously i'll point to where
[04:34] it's going to go before it's going to go
[04:35] so there you go
[04:36] makes things a lot easier quicker for me
[04:38] everyone else as well and
[04:40] it doesn't cost me a
[04:42] fortune to run this community it's
[04:44] rather large
[04:45] and since you all don't pay anymore i'm
[04:47] not running a mentorship anymore where
[04:49] you pay me okay no one can join this
[04:52] so that's the distinction they get to
[04:54] see analysis before the fact and
[04:57] incorporate the things that they learned
[04:59] whereas on youtube i'm giving you one
[05:01] specific model a bread and butter
[05:03] approach where you can literally go in
[05:05] there isn't a lot of moving parts
[05:07] i stripped it down to its chrome okay
[05:11] no
[05:13] fluff
[05:14] in it okay straight right to the brass
[05:17] tacks
[05:18] now the same thing i've done with this
[05:20] youtube model
[05:21] my mentorship
[05:23] that is charter member
[05:25] they can do the same thing with what was
[05:27] taught to them
[05:28] they can strip it down or they can make
[05:30] it as intricate and complex as they want
[05:34] that's the private mentorship group it
[05:36] goes into a lot of detail that is
[05:38] honestly
[05:40] overwhelming for the majority of them
[05:43] and as i mentioned when i promoted it
[05:45] it's only for the freaks that want to
[05:47] just know everything okay not that it's
[05:49] going to be useful for everyone but
[05:53] in contrast to what they get and what
[05:56] i'm giving you on youtube
[05:58] i've literally
[05:59] laid a working
[06:01] model
[06:03] with
[06:04] very easy rules
[06:06] that don't really go beyond what i'm
[06:08] going to show
[06:09] so far
[06:10] that in my opinion
[06:12] can make you a consistently
[06:14] successful analyst let's say it that way
[06:17] okay because i can't promise
[06:18] profitability no one can
[06:20] the only thing i promise and this is
[06:21] what i promised in my product mentorship
[06:23] too it's
[06:24] i promise that you're going to learn how
[06:26] to read the markets better than anybody
[06:28] else would be able to show you
[06:29] and i can prove that these things work i
[06:31] do it every single week every single
[06:34] week i outline these things and if it
[06:36] doesn't work it won't hold up
[06:38] so right away you can read the comments
[06:41] in the youtube
[06:42] mentorship and you can see people are
[06:44] really excited because they're seeing
[06:45] the results of simply going in and
[06:47] looking for the things i've outlined
[06:50] i'm not giving you a lot of different
[06:51] things to look for i'm giving a very
[06:52] specific thing during a specific time of
[06:55] day
[06:56] and if you focus there over a period of
[06:58] time you'll start to see things that
[07:00] repeat over and over and over again now
[07:02] they're going to have subtle
[07:04] differences but they generally have the
[07:06] same framework
[07:08] and what do i mean by that
[07:10] well they'll have certain signatures in
[07:11] price where it creates the fair value
[07:14] gap
[07:15] and then it breaks a low comes back up
[07:17] and fills in the gap maybe it partially
[07:19] fills it maybe it goes halfway
[07:21] maybe it completely closes it in
[07:23] we don't need that
[07:25] we don't need to be precise that's what
[07:26] i'm trying to show you here that you
[07:27] don't need to be
[07:30] pinpoint precision accurate you can be
[07:32] very
[07:35] well
[07:35] average in your entry
[07:38] and as long as you're using sound money
[07:39] management you can obviously fare it out
[07:42] you know setups that will yield
[07:43] consistency okay
[07:45] so
[07:47] with all that said
[07:49] now you know the real story
[07:51] i'm not getting shut down okay i'm not
[07:53] going to stop teaching in fact i'm
[07:54] probably going to now
[07:56] uh do more youtube how's that sound okay
[07:58] just to get under the skin of those that
[08:00] just don't like it
[08:02] all right so the dollar index is our
[08:05] daily chart
[08:06] and i mentioned obviously this is you
[08:08] know
[08:09] for the folks that were with me on
[08:10] monday so you're going to have to just
[08:12] take that in stride if you weren't part
[08:14] of that group but nonetheless
[08:17] the idea is that we were looking for a
[08:19] bullish dollar we've been bullish on
[08:21] dollar for a while now and i was
[08:23] mentioning that we would go for the full
[08:25] 100 level we hit that i mentioned we
[08:27] would go to 101.
[08:29] and i mentioned how we could probably
[08:30] draw back down in after hitting 101.
[08:33] that's one of our targets and the second
[08:35] one was going to be
[08:37] 101.947 and just for clarity's sake
[08:41] the other one was just
[08:42] short of 103 but i just rounded it to
[08:45] the 103.
[08:46] i'm not calling a top here in dollar you
[08:49] know i don't do that i'm staying with
[08:51] the
[08:52] online narrative that
[08:54] dollar should keep being pressed higher
[08:57] this is just a
[08:58] in my mind right now until proven
[09:00] otherwise uh just a retracement after
[09:02] hitting another
[09:03] uh premium level
[09:05] now what changes my mind on about the
[09:08] dollar being bullish if we go below
[09:09] these lows in here
[09:11] that to me signals a potential turn or
[09:14] enemy term high forming in the
[09:16] marketplace and it would take a little
[09:17] bit of time even after that for me to
[09:19] change my long-term bullish stance one
[09:21] dollar
[09:23] so what am i saying in short
[09:25] i'm
[09:26] allowing for sloppy price action as i
[09:29] mentioned on monday night's commentary
[09:31] for the private group i know this is
[09:33] going to be confusing for me oh you're
[09:34] confusing me just deal with it folks
[09:36] okay it's free okay
[09:38] so
[09:40] i mentioned on monday night that we
[09:41] could probably see some sloppy price
[09:43] action and i'm not in a hurry
[09:46] to make decisions about actually going
[09:48] in and taking live trades again yet
[09:49] because we just came off passover
[09:52] there's a lot of
[09:54] holiday volume and a lot of money stays
[09:56] on the sidelines during that weekend
[09:58] it may not seem
[10:00] practical to some of you but it's true
[10:03] so we have to work out that little bit
[10:06] of
[10:07] lull in the volume and
[10:10] i give that a few days and in fact it
[10:12] might even be the rest of this week and
[10:13] then maybe next week things will be a
[10:15] little bit cleaner in terms of the price
[10:16] action so higher prices on dollar that's
[10:19] what i'm looking for until proven wrong
[10:22] and we've obviously seen two targets
[10:24] here hit the 100 level and the 101
[10:27] rather handsomely so i have that level
[10:29] highlighted here we'll drop down into
[10:30] the hourly chart now
[10:33] okay you see how we moved up in at the
[10:35] 101 level
[10:37] look what they left here
[10:39] see that see how clean that is
[10:41] price does not like to leave those types
[10:43] of formations in in its week so in other
[10:47] words
[10:48] even though we had a market drop
[10:50] even though we took out a swing low even
[10:52] though we had a fair value got even
[10:53] though it came up here and filled it in
[10:55] look at the body's respecting that it's
[10:56] beautiful
[10:58] that's beautiful price action
[11:01] yes there's a little bit of movement
[11:02] above it with the wicks here okay
[11:04] but the bodies look how it's telling the
[11:07] story there that is algorithmic price
[11:10] action okay that is delivered by an
[11:12] algorithm that is not buying and selling
[11:14] pressure
[11:15] okay that's not supply and demand it's
[11:17] not harmonic it's
[11:19] none of that stuff
[11:20] it is
[11:22] the algorithm
[11:23] delivering price
[11:25] on its terms and we as speculators
[11:28] have the
[11:30] fortunate
[11:31] opportunity to be participants in these
[11:34] opportunities
[11:36] when they are presented
[11:38] but they're not going to be profitable
[11:40] because of things we learned in books
[11:43] indicators didn't drive markets higher
[11:45] or lower
[11:46] any retail logic did not drive markets
[11:48] higher or lower these markets are going
[11:50] to book
[11:51] print and deliver
[11:53] on the basis of its algorithm
[11:56] now either you understand that and get
[11:58] in line with that or get run over
[12:01] if you're winning
[12:03] in any school of thought and i don't
[12:05] care what it is i've done all of that
[12:06] stuff okay
[12:09] the only time
[12:10] that i can look back and see when my
[12:11] trades were profitable is when i was in
[12:13] line with what the algorithm would do
[12:16] anyway
[12:17] now some of you watching and you may be
[12:19] watching this as a new viewer for some
[12:21] of you this may be the first viewing
[12:23] opportunity you had with me
[12:25] it's going to sound like this guy's
[12:26] talking conspiracy well it's not
[12:28] conspiracy it's obviously you know we're
[12:30] running electronic markets now and ai is
[12:33] driving it and there's really nothing
[12:35] you can do
[12:36] to change it so the only thing i can
[12:39] suggest you is just investigate the
[12:40] things i suggest
[12:42] are happening in the marketplace
[12:44] and i promise you if you spend no i
[12:46] don't know a good month
[12:48] you'll either see it if you don't move
[12:50] along there's a lot of other people that
[12:52] are very friendly on youtube i'm not
[12:53] saying that they're good
[12:55] i'm not trying to represent anybody
[12:56] saying as a good teacher
[12:59] but
[13:00] there's other people out there are
[13:02] willing to give you their time and you
[13:04] go chase them but
[13:08] with the dollar index
[13:10] showing even the signatures that i have
[13:12] been showing you
[13:13] in the youtube community
[13:16] doesn't this low being broken here in
[13:18] that very gap
[13:20] hits it right there we have another
[13:21] higher variable you got so what does
[13:22] that mean it could trade up into that
[13:25] but we're looking for the entry in here
[13:27] and then look at that now is this a
[13:29] one-minute chart no
[13:31] how about a two-minute chart
[13:33] five no of course not five fifteen
[13:35] minute no it's an hourly chart
[13:38] and that same fractal nature of that
[13:40] pattern i'm teaching you in the youtube
[13:42] community
[13:44] it exists here
[13:46] now
[13:48] if we look at the high
[13:50] and the low that whole price swing here
[13:52] from that low up to this high here
[13:54] that parent price swing if you put a fib
[13:57] on that and find out 50 percent of that
[13:59] it's going to put you about in this area
[14:00] you're saying i'm eyeballing it but
[14:02] ultimately right below that low isn't it
[14:04] interesting that's exactly what i was
[14:05] teaching you in the youtube
[14:07] model
[14:08] but i'm teaching you
[14:11] to use it on
[14:13] any market
[14:14] don't be on this team mentality because
[14:17] i already see it brewing in the comments
[14:19] section
[14:20] a lot of futures traders are like yeah
[14:22] ict you know i love the nasdaq trades
[14:24] and the e-mini s p i love it we're
[14:26] future traders we you know we love what
[14:28] you're doing like i just discovered
[14:29] future trading
[14:31] i did that stuff back in the 90s 1992 i
[14:33] cut my teeth on all that stuff
[14:37] this is applicable to forex it's
[14:38] applicable to bonds it's applicable to
[14:42] futures
[14:43] okay i have students that'll swear by it
[14:45] working in crypto for the folks that are
[14:48] asking about crypto i am not a crypto
[14:50] trader if i traded crypto i would blow
[14:53] my accounts out okay there you go i'm
[14:55] not good at trading crypto if i was
[14:58] believe me you'd hear about it but i'm
[15:00] not okay so i bloomed where i was
[15:03] planted okay so i'm good in forex i'm
[15:06] good at futures that's it okay i don't
[15:08] need to be anything else i don't need to
[15:10] be a jack of all trades and meet
[15:12] everyone's expectations if that doesn't
[15:14] you know tickle your fancy i apologize
[15:16] but again back to the website earlier
[15:18] you're welcome to go see someone else if
[15:19] that's not what you're looking for
[15:22] but it goes to about 50 of that parent
[15:24] price like here from here to here that's
[15:26] algorithmic so we have a break in
[15:28] structure here fair value gap here the
[15:32] volume of the move
[15:33] is inside the bodies of the candle see
[15:36] that
[15:37] we always allow for some inherent price
[15:39] action
[15:40] with the wicks and the tails of the
[15:42] candles but we're looking for the
[15:44] underlying
[15:45] narrative
[15:47] it's likely to go back in here and fill
[15:48] this one single candle that created that
[15:51] imbalance
[15:53] this candle's low this candle is high
[15:55] that small little imbalance right in
[15:56] here it goes up and fills in that spends
[15:58] some time there
[15:59] then
[16:00] breaks aggressively attacking all the
[16:02] stops below here here here fills in the
[16:05] gap and then goes right below that low
[16:07] why
[16:08] because equilibrium exists between this
[16:10] low
[16:12] and this high
[16:13] why did it drop like this because it hit
[16:16] our second target of 101 and plus it's
[16:19] 100 points or pips
[16:22] above the full 100 level where is wait
[16:25] where's that good grief here it is okay
[16:27] so we really stretched above it and then
[16:30] we had this now to me
[16:33] this looks a little bit like
[16:35] them trying to produce
[16:37] this sentiment idea that the dollar has
[16:39] topped
[16:39] i'm not convinced of that yet okay
[16:43] it could and i could be absolutely wrong
[16:44] and these highs are may be the you know
[16:47] the ones that top the dollar that always
[16:50] exists that's where i can be wrong
[16:52] i don't mind being wrong
[16:54] by not trying to pick tops and bottoms i
[16:57] don't mind that okay it doesn't make me
[16:58] feel inferior does it make me feel like
[17:00] i don't know what i'm doing it keeps me
[17:03] on the right side of institutional order
[17:05] flow institutional order flow is rooted
[17:08] on higher time frame
[17:10] bias
[17:11] okay and that being for the dollar it's
[17:13] bullish well it's bullish in my opinion
[17:16] let's say it that way
[17:17] so
[17:19] while i don't subscribe to the idea that
[17:21] we have topped here i like the idea that
[17:23] we came back down into this run
[17:26] and it looks like for everyone else that
[17:28] may be looking for
[17:30] resistance ideas
[17:32] and a break in
[17:33] you know the market structure
[17:35] and a break and re-test idea i don't
[17:38] think it's that simple i know some of
[17:40] you will argue and snickers oh it is
[17:41] that simple that's fine that's for your
[17:43] model but i'm talking about calling tops
[17:45] and bottoms in the marketplace that's
[17:47] what i'm specifically honing in on
[17:50] i think that we're going to revisit that
[17:51] 101 level and we have unfinished
[17:53] business above it that means it's likely
[17:55] go a little bit higher than that that's
[17:57] what i'm subscribing to right now i'm
[17:59] not convinced at all that we've changed
[18:02] gears
[18:02] now why am i beating this up
[18:04] because some of you
[18:06] didn't listen to me when i said that
[18:09] some of you didn't listen to me when i
[18:11] said it the second time
[18:13] because you have selective hearing
[18:14] you're waiting for the word order block
[18:16] or fair value gap or break in market
[18:18] structure
[18:19] because you came into this video
[18:22] with
[18:23] preconceived notions or expectations
[18:26] that i'm going to somehow
[18:28] qualify your analysis that you think is
[18:31] going to happen in forex so therefore
[18:33] when i say these buzzwords your ears are
[18:36] going to perk up and you'll be real
[18:38] attentive then
[18:39] and then what will happen is
[18:41] you're going to do something in the
[18:42] marketplace based on that and not even
[18:44] listen to anything else in this video
[18:46] because i'm talking too much that's
[18:48] going to be the excuse but you're not
[18:50] listening
[18:51] okay you have to listen and understand
[18:53] what i'm teaching you that's the lecture
[18:55] here do not try to pick tops and bottoms
[18:58] you don't need that there's a lot of
[19:00] opportunity between
[19:01] intermediate term highs and lows i don't
[19:03] mind missing the long-term high in a
[19:05] long-term low i don't need that i can be
[19:08] wrong in trades trying to be bullish on
[19:11] dollar i don't trade the dollar but if
[19:13] i'm bullish on dollar that means
[19:15] essentially i'm what
[19:16] bearish euro bearish british pound
[19:19] versus us dollar
[19:21] all foreign currencies i'm bearish on
[19:23] and bullish one dollar that's
[19:25] essentially what i'm saying here so
[19:28] i don't want any of you taking what i'm
[19:30] saying here in one sentence or one
[19:32] little notation that i make reference to
[19:35] in a specific chart
[19:36] and make a
[19:38] sentiment idea
[19:40] okay or a justification for your trade
[19:43] so just be mindful that okay
[19:47] all right so 15 minute time frame we
[19:49] finally made
[19:50] it south side liquidy resting below
[19:53] these
[19:54] lows in here swing low and we had cell
[19:57] side resting below here as well so as i
[19:59] mentioned too clean up here they're
[20:01] really building the idea that this is
[20:03] resistance
[20:04] i don't think that's
[20:06] the case and we might want to go a
[20:08] little bit deeper
[20:09] if it retrades back let's go back up to
[20:12] this here we could trade back to the 100
[20:14] level maybe
[20:16] sneak below just a little bit to make
[20:18] everybody think this is really done
[20:20] if i was making the market for a dollar
[20:22] i would take it down below 100.
[20:24] dip it into
[20:25] 99.95 or 92
[20:28] in that area here and then start to work
[20:30] it higher that's that's how i would do
[20:32] it because it would convince everybody
[20:34] out there that the dollar is probably
[20:36] topped and
[20:38] then i would take it the other direction
[20:41] you know what i'm talking about it
[20:42] happens most of the time in your trades
[20:44] you get in and you take something all
[20:46] sudden no it's not as bullish as i
[20:47] thought it was and it went lower
[20:50] i've been there focused on i'm not
[20:51] making fun of you
[20:53] all right so here is that hourly fair
[20:56] value gap but now look at it with the
[20:58] lens of the 15 minute time frame
[21:01] so we have this area here
[21:03] but then we have this
[21:05] imbalance
[21:06] right there
[21:08] so it comes up a little bit deeper
[21:09] closes that in what do these two up
[21:12] close candles represent
[21:14] a bearish order block
[21:17] so we can use the low
[21:20] of the lowest
[21:21] up close candle
[21:23] and its opening price
[21:25] you draw that out in time
[21:27] hammered it
[21:29] why is this an order block
[21:31] well it's because it's
[21:34] where
[21:35] price was delivered on the upside even
[21:37] though it's indecisive candles here that
[21:39] up close
[21:41] right before this
[21:42] displacement to the downside
[21:44] it's not listen to me folks it's not
[21:46] what these folks are taking from my
[21:48] videos and writing books on amazon
[21:50] completely wrong
[21:52] and there's a lot of things i'm going to
[21:53] keep from even my private mentorship
[21:55] group about order block theory until my
[21:58] books are released okay and i've
[22:00] purposely held that back why is he
[22:02] holding back everything you know it's
[22:04] because i have four books coming one's a
[22:05] one's a fiction and three are technical
[22:09] okay so
[22:10] i'm gonna put things out there
[22:12] because there's a lot of people out
[22:13] there have
[22:14] falsely
[22:16] stated that they created this or i
[22:18] copied it for something and you don't
[22:20] know anything about order blocks okay
[22:22] trust me you don't know anything about
[22:23] it but
[22:24] you know enough to find something that
[22:27] repeats over and over again
[22:30] in
[22:31] the second book in my trilogy i'm
[22:33] writing
[22:34] when is it coming out you'll know more
[22:35] about that as i come this is a whole
[22:38] pandemic thing messed up the delivery
[22:40] schedule i had for him but
[22:42] the second volume in that trilogy i'm
[22:44] gonna divulge a lot about order blocks
[22:47] so that way
[22:48] the world the community and trading will
[22:50] know it's mine and you'll know more
[22:53] about it there so anything that happens
[22:55] after the fact i'm going to correct a
[22:57] lot of people that think they need to
[22:58] talk about blocks because actually
[22:59] harming people that pay them or listen
[23:01] to them
[23:03] and it's not true
[23:05] so really what they're saying is the
[23:07] stuff that goes along with supply and
[23:08] demand and i'm not supplying demand
[23:11] but why are these candles here on order
[23:13] block
[23:14] it's because we had the change in the
[23:15] state of delivery where it's already
[23:17] dropping then it goes higher so the
[23:20] algorithm is
[23:22] putting a
[23:23] it's kind of like a a bookmark
[23:26] okay this is where
[23:27] it will want to refer back to in the
[23:29] future
[23:31] okay think of it like that
[23:32] so
[23:34] let's say you're reading a book okay and
[23:36] you're in this chapter and all of a
[23:38] sudden real life kicks in you got to go
[23:40] back to work or you
[23:42] can't read anymore because your spouse
[23:44] says you know you need to do some things
[23:46] around the house
[23:48] and it knows nudge so you have to stop
[23:51] reading you put your little bookmark in
[23:53] the page where you're at okay and then
[23:54] you come back to it later on well
[23:57] when you stop reading that's essentially
[23:59] where this candle closes
[24:01] and then all this happens while you're
[24:03] away from the book
[24:04] and then when you come back to the book
[24:06] here you pick up with the storyline and
[24:07] what was the story line it was dropping
[24:09] it just had a little pause in here and
[24:11] then we go right back to the storyline
[24:12] so maybe that analogy doesn't fit you
[24:14] but
[24:16] it makes sense
[24:17] a lot of ways to me okay it's like a a
[24:20] reference point that the algorithm will
[24:22] go back to because
[24:23] the algorithm doesn't know where your
[24:25] specific stop is at all times
[24:28] your broker does
[24:29] but the algorithm doesn't necessarily
[24:32] know where your stop is or my stop is
[24:34] at any given time
[24:36] but it's based on the logic that is
[24:40] really
[24:41] promoted and regurgitated
[24:43] all the time in books and seminars and
[24:45] course teachers and things
[24:47] put your stop rate above the high
[24:49] put your stop right above the highs you
[24:50] know it's always the same thing all the
[24:53] time and it doesn't take
[24:55] you know a rocket scientist to sit down
[24:56] on the chart and say yeah well if it's
[24:58] been dropping find a short-term high
[25:00] most recently and that's where right
[25:02] above that there's going to be buy stops
[25:03] for anyone that's short they've trailed
[25:04] their stop-loss down
[25:06] so what does that mean it's like anyone
[25:08] that went short up here and was
[25:09] fortunate to be right
[25:11] and it does this move here starts to
[25:13] break down their stop would be moved
[25:14] from here to right above this short term
[25:16] high that trailing stop loss mentality
[25:18] okay
[25:19] i'm not a real big fan of rushing my
[25:21] stop
[25:22] and that's why i teach the way i teach
[25:23] because i'm looking for things that make
[25:25] sense and i'm not trying to strangle the
[25:28] marketplace
[25:29] but this order block
[25:32] here is a change in the state of
[25:33] delivery it's been going lower it's
[25:36] likely to go lower
[25:39] this
[25:40] displacement qualifies
[25:44] that order block because it creates a
[25:46] fair value
[25:47] and the narrative is likely to go lower
[25:51] now this lower movement is short term in
[25:53] nature it's
[25:55] counter
[25:56] long-term bias
[25:58] okay
[26:00] you can and will absolutely lose money
[26:03] trading this style trading
[26:06] because you're going against the higher
[26:08] time frame order flow this type of
[26:10] trading if you go in and you're trying
[26:12] to be very nimble trying to go in and
[26:14] think you can
[26:16] you swing up and down buy sell buy sell
[26:19] and you just recently started you're
[26:21] going to absolutely blow your account
[26:23] okay that is exactly what's going to
[26:25] happen so don't do this so why am i
[26:27] teaching this so that way you don't do
[26:29] it understand that this is all part of a
[26:31] natural retracement
[26:33] and you can trust and study and back
[26:35] test all the things that i've been
[26:36] teaching you and they exist even in
[26:38] these moves here but you may not and
[26:40] don't be offended by this you may not
[26:42] have the skill set
[26:44] to see this type of retracement lower
[26:46] and short it
[26:48] that's okay you don't need to have that
[26:50] skill set i have students that are
[26:52] really good with trading
[26:54] contrary in setups like this
[26:57] that don't trust bias because they think
[26:59] the moment they get in it's going to
[27:01] turn on them so they like to take
[27:03] contrary in trades where they trust it
[27:06] more because it just makes sense for it
[27:07] to be broken
[27:10] if that makes any sense in other words
[27:13] they
[27:14] they know that this possibly makes heat
[27:15] going higher because they hear me saying
[27:17] it
[27:18] but that doesn't change their
[27:20] convictions about being a contrarian
[27:23] and in some ways they're
[27:25] going against what i'm saying is a
[27:27] higher time frame overflow
[27:29] bias
[27:30] but they know how to pick these
[27:31] opportunities where there is
[27:33] confirmation is not likely to continue
[27:35] at that very moment
[27:36] so therefore they'll go in and go
[27:38] against that bias and take trades now is
[27:41] that wrong no because it matches their
[27:43] personality and they know where those
[27:45] opportunities exist
[27:47] do i think that all new students should
[27:49] go in with that expectation and that
[27:51] mode of study absolutely not
[27:55] no way absolutely no way
[27:57] because
[27:58] if that's what you really are internally
[28:00] as a trader it'll materialize and
[28:03] manifest itself over time
[28:06] but the only way you're going to know
[28:07] that is by learning the way i'm teaching
[28:09] it because i'm teaching you how to trust
[28:11] the higher time frame bias
[28:13] okay i'm not teaching the trend as your
[28:15] friend because
[28:16] the things that they're
[28:18] using to
[28:20] you know promote those ideas i don't
[28:22] subscribe to so since i don't subscribe
[28:24] to those views
[28:25] i don't look at it that way so i'm
[28:27] looking at how the market moves from
[28:28] discount to premium premium to discount
[28:30] and also within market structure
[28:33] so some of you at times will point and
[28:36] say it looks like this or it looks like
[28:37] that over here
[28:39] it's only momentary
[28:43] familiarity it looks familiar
[28:46] but it's not there's a whole lot of
[28:48] other things going on that just
[28:50] sometimes look very similar to certain
[28:53] things but there's a specific criteria
[28:56] that takes place that i'm looking for
[28:57] that i teach my students
[28:59] and you've learned a very simple
[29:01] approach to that that's existing right
[29:02] here in this chart in the youtube model
[29:08] alright so you're a dollar daily chart
[29:11] all right so it's been a while since
[29:13] i've talked to the youtube community i
[29:15] think it's been like
[29:17] two weeks or so and that something to
[29:19] that effect um
[29:21] but i drove your attention to
[29:24] that low i said we were aiming for that
[29:26] and
[29:28] as luck would have it look it went down
[29:29] there
[29:30] so
[29:31] that is an example of
[29:34] bias that is an example of what i've
[29:36] actually talked to my
[29:38] community about for well weeks as it was
[29:41] starting to come down we were up here
[29:43] looking forward to come down to that low
[29:45] i mentioned this low here i mentioned
[29:46] these lows here and this low there
[29:49] and you all on youtube
[29:51] knew that we were looking for this run
[29:53] on euro
[29:54] the problem and this is why i'm not
[29:57] trading forex at the moment okay no
[29:59] forex is not broken no i don't think
[30:01] they're ever going to change the
[30:01] algorithm no i don't think that they're
[30:03] going to change their algorithm or go
[30:05] against the things i'm teaching because
[30:06] the way i'm teaching is the market
[30:08] itself
[30:10] it's the internal engines that make
[30:12] these price deliveries
[30:14] appear on your chart
[30:17] okay
[30:18] that's why i'm teaching it
[30:20] and with with no real reservations
[30:22] because i know
[30:24] me teaching this
[30:26] isn't going to change anything
[30:29] the level of trades that are being
[30:31] pushed through these markets
[30:34] is not going to be changed
[30:37] by you watching these videos because
[30:38] honestly
[30:40] i've taught for years
[30:42] and there's a lot of people that just
[30:44] simply cannot follow instructions they
[30:46] can't follow rules and they want to
[30:48] fault somebody else they're going to
[30:49] fault this one over here they want to
[30:51] fault me they want to fault the concepts
[30:53] when there's people already out there
[30:54] proving just from the free stuff
[30:56] that they're passing
[30:58] competitions and challenges and you know
[31:01] making money in their own accounts
[31:03] you're doing very well in demo they all
[31:04] have a wide range of experiences already
[31:07] and i've only started the last week or
[31:08] so in january
[31:10] so
[31:11] this business is very personal
[31:14] and it's going to reveal a lot of things
[31:15] about you and you're going to see things
[31:16] that you didn't recognize before and
[31:18] sometimes it's gonna be ugly
[31:21] you're not as
[31:23] good as you thought you were
[31:25] you're not as astute as you thought you
[31:27] were you're not as responsible
[31:29] as you thought you were
[31:31] believe me i learned those lessons in
[31:33] the 90s and it was
[31:34] not fun
[31:36] and you resist it and the folks that
[31:37] resist it will never get it
[31:40] and they'll never learn how to trade
[31:41] properly from anyone else because they
[31:42] have a deep-rooted issue within
[31:44] themselves so it won't make a difference
[31:46] if somebody else steps in and says hey i
[31:47] got something that's going to do it for
[31:48] you ict complicates things i'm going to
[31:51] give you this thing here you push a
[31:52] button and it gets you in
[31:54] no the same underlying issues that are
[31:57] plaguing the individual will manifest in
[32:00] any trading approach because they lack
[32:03] responsibility number one
[32:05] they lack the
[32:08] adherence to rules
[32:11] and they have not put enough time
[32:14] if you're not getting instant
[32:15] gratification
[32:16] you're done
[32:17] that's what the main critical thing
[32:19] about me is
[32:21] because i'm lecturing i'm teaching you
[32:24] what you're going to encounter you may
[32:25] not feel this is applicable to you but i
[32:27] guarantee you stay long enough in this
[32:30] you're going to be met with this and if
[32:31] i don't tell you
[32:33] how to deal with it or overcome it or
[32:35] think about how you should be
[32:37] overcoming it when you get to that
[32:39] bridge okay because you're all going to
[32:40] get to it eventually
[32:42] different times different people
[32:44] everyone grows differently
[32:46] but you're going to have these
[32:47] crossroads where you come to where you
[32:49] feel like you know i don't think i
[32:50] should be doing this anymore i think i
[32:52] should be doing that or the grass looks
[32:53] greener on that over here or this person
[32:55] made money over here and i haven't made
[32:57] money this week so maybe my stuff's
[32:59] broken let me go and look at this that's
[33:01] nonsense
[33:02] there's people out there that don't
[33:04] trade like me
[33:05] and they make millions
[33:08] because they are good money managers
[33:11] period that's it
[33:13] they
[33:14] have something that gives them a
[33:15] decision-making process they call it
[33:16] their system okay or their edge
[33:20] but really they're just good money
[33:21] managers
[33:23] period
[33:26] they have something that instigates the
[33:28] idea of a transaction in the marketplace
[33:31] they have a faith based
[33:33] system in believing that as long as it
[33:35] doesn't do this go down to a level where
[33:37] they would put a stop
[33:39] they'll stay with that idea
[33:41] and then when it gets to another level
[33:42] they get out that's trading okay but the
[33:44] idea is
[33:46] i don't think
[33:48] that
[33:49] profitable systems outside of what i'm
[33:52] teaching
[33:54] are linked to their actual system
[33:57] it's linked to their adherence to their
[33:59] rules
[34:00] sound money management
[34:02] and not over trading and not over
[34:03] leveraging
[34:05] because literally i could flip a quarter
[34:07] and you could too with sound mounting
[34:09] management you could make a account be
[34:11] profitable
[34:12] now that sounds crazy okay
[34:15] do it with a demo i said i'm suggesting
[34:17] to you here
[34:19] flip a quarter if it's heads you buy
[34:21] flip a quarter if it's tails you sell
[34:22] short do it every single day don't risk
[34:25] more than a half percent aim for
[34:27] one percent and do that
[34:29] buy the open
[34:31] sell the open that's it that's all you
[34:33] do use a
[34:35] use a 30 pip stop
[34:37] and trade a forex pair and do it okay
[34:40] and just test the idea
[34:42] and see how hard it is to blow the
[34:45] account
[34:46] it takes a lot of effort to blow that
[34:48] account but over time you can see that
[34:50] it can show profitability
[34:53] now
[34:54] if you take that application and apply
[34:57] it to okay what happens if you limit
[35:00] your number of trades if you
[35:02] remove
[35:04] the frequency
[35:06] at which you trade intro week that means
[35:08] what days of the week you're actually
[35:09] going to specifically trade on
[35:11] and then within those days what specific
[35:14] time of that day are you going to trade
[35:15] on and then what asset classes are
[35:18] you're going to trade
[35:19] and inside that asset class what
[35:20] specific market are you going to trade
[35:22] and inside that specific market are you
[35:24] going to be bullsh or you're going to be
[35:25] bearish so you're refining everything
[35:28] down to
[35:29] an algorithm or a recipe because a
[35:32] recipe is an algorithm okay you have
[35:34] this list of ingredients and you put
[35:35] these ingredients and find them in a
[35:37] specific order and at the end you should
[35:39] have an expected result being a cake or
[35:41] a cookie or whatever it is that you know
[35:43] your mother grandmother used to make for
[35:44] you
[35:45] bottom line is
[35:47] i'm giving you recipes
[35:50] now
[35:51] it's up to you to decide on what you're
[35:53] going to do with this information i show
[35:55] it
[35:56] as you see every single week
[35:58] in my mentorship group
[36:00] i talk about where the market's going to
[36:01] go beforehand i'm not telling you to buy
[36:04] or sell short anything
[36:07] at any one particular level i'm pointing
[36:09] to where the market's going to go
[36:11] because i've already taught you entry
[36:12] strategies but i'm not trying to force a
[36:14] specific entry strategy on any one
[36:16] student or all of you collectively
[36:18] because there is no pressing all of you
[36:20] into a mode
[36:21] because
[36:22] that will absolutely guarantee
[36:25] failure
[36:26] failure as an as a mentor and be failure
[36:29] for a community of students
[36:32] i'm cognizant that there is a wide
[36:34] disparity between
[36:36] my personality and everyone else's and
[36:38] just as well as if we were on a room we
[36:39] would all have different personalities
[36:41] as well that's going to be an issue for
[36:43] all of you so my teaching style
[36:46] allows for you to find your own
[36:49] style
[36:50] in the tools and concepts that i teach
[36:53] now i could trade with every single one
[36:55] of them and my better students can do it
[36:58] with a a good list of them
[37:01] but i don't have one student out there
[37:02] that can do everything
[37:04] well
[37:05] perfectly that doesn't i haven't had
[37:07] that yet i'd like to believe before i
[37:08] pass on i will but i don't have that yet
[37:11] but i do have some extremely good
[37:14] traders
[37:15] some consistently good profitable
[37:18] traders
[37:19] but i also have late you know failures
[37:22] you know these folks just simply can't
[37:23] get it
[37:24] now
[37:26] in the youtube community give it time
[37:28] you're gonna you're gonna see people
[37:29] commenting that they can't do it okay my
[37:32] encouragement to all of you
[37:34] is the same thing i'm going to tell
[37:37] you that i tell my private group in
[37:39] their form
[37:41] do not gang up on them don't make fun of
[37:44] them don't say oh well you know this
[37:46] that i don't think
[37:47] um
[37:48] be encouraging today because really if
[37:50] they're posting that they're hurting
[37:53] they feel frustrated and they're
[37:55] basically saying unless someone
[37:57] intervenes right now i'm gonna quit
[38:00] and i have done that
[38:02] there's been nobody to tell me
[38:04] keep going okay back in the 90s i just
[38:07] had to persevere
[38:09] i'm hoping by me showing these things
[38:12] publicly talking about what's going to
[38:14] happen
[38:14] where it's going to go it
[38:17] proves you that it's
[38:19] possible to forecast these price moves
[38:22] now what you do is you go back inside
[38:24] all the moves here and decipher what it
[38:27] is i'm
[38:29] pointing to and why it was useful for
[38:32] you to
[38:33] find a setup in it and is does that set
[38:35] up repeat enough for you to justify that
[38:38] specific way or approach of trading what
[38:40] do i mean by that
[38:42] some of my students can't day trade they
[38:44] just don't have the ability to do it
[38:46] they have
[38:46] businesses or
[38:48] school or they have jobs
[38:51] and they have to be
[38:53] you know making ends meet they're
[38:56] elsewhere they can't be in front of the
[38:57] charts
[38:58] so they have the position trade so that
[39:00] means they're going to have to trade on
[39:01] the daily chart or a four hour chart
[39:03] and that's fine you can do that it just
[39:05] takes a lot of time to move from these
[39:08] levels here down to here
[39:10] and then you got to wait a long time for
[39:12] the next new setup i'm not a fan of that
[39:15] but i'm not trying to discourage anybody
[39:17] that has to operate under those
[39:20] restraints but i mentioned on the
[39:21] youtube community
[39:23] in the mentorship videos for this
[39:25] channel i mentioned that we were going
[39:26] to be aiming for that low we got that
[39:30] it's sloppy on its delivery but it got
[39:32] down there
[39:34] back to why i'm not touching forex it's
[39:36] because of this type of movement here
[39:39] everything is really muddy right now the
[39:42] reason why currencies are not moving
[39:44] well is because trade is being hindered
[39:47] there is a supply chain congestion
[39:50] all these factors are causing currencies
[39:53] not to move if you look around everybody
[39:56] that is been in this business for a long
[39:59] time that's
[40:00] consistently
[40:02] trading profitable they're noteworthy
[40:05] they're kind of like the the pillars of
[40:07] the trading community
[40:09] none of them are really talking about
[40:11] currencies right now because it's a
[40:12] quiet asset class
[40:14] it's a sleep right now
[40:16] i don't think it's going to stay this
[40:18] way forever okay and when it springs
[40:20] back to life
[40:22] everybody's going to want to go back
[40:23] into currencies okay
[40:25] but right now it's a really slow market
[40:28] and it's really hard
[40:30] for a trader to learn
[40:32] in this environment
[40:34] because
[40:35] you want to see excitement you want to
[40:37] see animation in the price action and i
[40:38] get it that's what we want as traders so
[40:41] what i've done and i do this in my own
[40:43] analysis studies and teachings and
[40:45] trainings and
[40:46] the way i teach my product group too
[40:48] they'll test for it in the comments
[40:50] section you tell me i'm a liar okay if
[40:52] i'm not doing this every week with y'all
[40:55] every month every year
[40:57] i navigate the marketplace
[40:59] so i'm taking their attention to where
[41:01] the markets are going to be big movers
[41:03] where's the excitement i do that
[41:05] beforehand i'm not waiting for something
[41:07] to happen oh let's go over here now it's
[41:09] exciting no i'm always before the big
[41:11] moves start coming
[41:14] forex is not it right now okay
[41:17] index futures has been
[41:20] now we're also entering a period where
[41:22] it could get a little
[41:24] dry may typically can create some
[41:27] scenario where it's bearish
[41:29] i'm looking for evidence that's going to
[41:32] continue but we'll get into that when we
[41:33] talk about index futures but
[41:36] euro dollar
[41:38] delivered as we were expecting we got
[41:39] the lower prices
[41:41] and that same movement and idea of
[41:43] reaching for that low here
[41:45] is basically what i'm doing with the
[41:48] live streams
[41:49] but just with intraday charts okay so in
[41:51] other words what do i
[41:54] what i what do i promise to do with all
[41:57] of you you know the few times in may
[41:59] that i'm going to do the live streams
[42:00] i'm basically going to outline where i
[42:02] think the draw on liquidity is now what
[42:04] is that the draw liquidity was below
[42:05] this low here all this movement here
[42:07] each candle going lower
[42:09] each day it went down even though it
[42:10] made a low here on this candle and a low
[42:13] on this candle and a low here even this
[42:15] candle being up close and this candle
[42:17] you not quite yet making that low but
[42:19] then one day we smash down through it
[42:21] and we dug in a little bit deeper one
[42:23] more time not deeper than that low but
[42:26] deeper below that low
[42:28] on a daily basis you know we had one two
[42:31] three four
[42:32] five days below that old low and we came
[42:35] back up in
[42:38] i'm going to basically point to where i
[42:41] think intraday price action is going to
[42:42] go
[42:43] now i don't want any of you
[42:46] to take that as an invitation to go and
[42:49] trade on that
[42:51] that's the worst thing you can do
[42:53] not because i suck not because i can't
[42:56] trade not because i'm not good at
[42:57] analysis because i don't want you to do
[43:00] that yet
[43:01] i'm forcing you
[43:03] to study price action you have to learn
[43:06] how to tape read and if you can't tape
[43:08] read
[43:09] you will not be consistent in your
[43:10] trading period and a story that's the
[43:12] way it is
[43:13] because everything that you'll be doing
[43:16] if you make money is really not
[43:18] based on the market it's based on
[43:21] circumstance and believe me i've had
[43:24] periods of being profitable
[43:26] with just dumb luck
[43:29] it happened folks in the 90s i really
[43:31] thought when i first started
[43:34] that wow i read a book you know and i
[43:36] watched a couple videos and wow this
[43:39] stuff really works and what i was really
[43:40] doing was just buying a perpetual bull
[43:42] market and everything was going up i
[43:44] could have threw a dart at the wall and
[43:46] whatever it hit i was buying that and it
[43:48] made money
[43:49] everything was going up
[43:51] so it tricked me into thinking i knew
[43:53] what i was doing at the time
[43:54] and i didn't
[43:56] so
[43:58] i want you to take the live streams i do
[44:00] in may
[44:01] and
[44:02] sometimes it'll be forex majority time
[44:05] is gonna be futures
[44:07] don't be part of that team mentality
[44:10] futures is the better thing forex is the
[44:12] better thing it's just right now futures
[44:15] you know i have a vested interest in
[44:17] proving to the youtube community that
[44:19] number one
[44:20] i know those markets
[44:23] better actually than forex i started in
[44:26] futures in 1992.
[44:30] the same things
[44:31] that i always answer everyone okay let's
[44:33] say if you're wrong ict okay i
[44:35] understand i ask you all the time in the
[44:37] comments section
[44:38] what happens if you teach this to so
[44:40] many people will the algorithm be
[44:41] changed will they change the way it is
[44:43] will they go after people that use this
[44:45] blah blah blah
[44:48] i don't believe that's the case but
[44:50] let's go out on a limb and say ict is
[44:53] wrong
[44:54] okay say that the whole world goes to
[44:56] one currency okay
[44:58] and everything goes upside down and 4x
[45:00] no longer is there what would i do well
[45:03] if i was here i would go back to
[45:06] trading futures
[45:08] period
[45:10] so i don't want you to think that
[45:12] team futures is better than team 4x
[45:14] because believe me when forex comes back
[45:16] to life
[45:17] it's going to smoke index futures and
[45:20] it's going to be all kinds of excitement
[45:21] back in currencies okay
[45:25] it that's the way it is folks it moves
[45:27] in and out of
[45:28] you know asset classes are really really
[45:30] hot and then they go cold and something
[45:32] else gets really exciting it's this
[45:35] navigation through the asset classes
[45:38] that experience and those with
[45:40] experience doing it
[45:42] know how to do 30 years you know i've
[45:45] been doing this stuff 30
[45:47] years
[45:48] and those 30 years the greatest lessons
[45:50] i learned was what i'm suggesting and
[45:53] talking about right now to some of you
[45:54] young guys okay
[45:56] it's just too much talking but these are
[45:58] the things that you need to understand
[46:00] because they're going to be the
[46:01] impediments to you succeeding because
[46:04] you think
[46:05] every day there's going to be a big move
[46:06] in the euro because you see something
[46:09] just because you think you see something
[46:11] doesn't mean that that market's going to
[46:12] do anything
[46:14] look how
[46:15] consolidated it was for this day here
[46:18] here here and here then finally it just
[46:20] whips down below that low
[46:22] that could be very frustrating for
[46:24] someone that has been
[46:25] expecting this thing to go down
[46:27] and
[46:28] for instance look at the folks that
[46:30] would have been trying to break out go
[46:32] short below that low here it does so
[46:34] here and it comes ripping right back up
[46:35] in the same day
[46:39] and
[46:40] that might have changed their opinion
[46:42] about the market
[46:44] going lower
[46:45] but i teach that that liquidity below
[46:47] that low is where it's really going to
[46:49] go so these up close candles really are
[46:51] just opportunities to go short
[46:53] and then drive it lower
[46:54] okay so
[46:57] i'll talk a little bit more about the
[46:58] live streams when we get to the e-mini s
[47:00] p part
[47:02] all right so admittedly this video is a
[47:05] lot more talking than i normally do is
[47:07] because i'm conscious
[47:09] that there are two communities here
[47:12] so i'm having conversations with both of
[47:13] you now to me it's normal i can do these
[47:16] kind of things i can go back and forth
[47:17] and start a conversation leave it and do
[47:20] some other things and come back and fill
[47:22] in the gaps i wanted to talk about but
[47:25] i know this is the type of video that's
[47:26] going to drive most of you that are
[47:28] really really
[47:31] critical
[47:32] it's going to drive you nuts
[47:33] but i promise you if you listen to me
[47:36] there's some really good stuff in this
[47:37] video
[47:39] so just take what you you find useful
[47:41] in which you don't find useful just
[47:43] filter out
[47:44] so here's the hourly chart on euro
[47:46] market traded down aggressively here on
[47:48] this day
[47:49] swept below that low here's that daily
[47:51] low
[47:52] let me go back that way because i've
[47:53] done a lot of talking probably didn't
[47:56] make note of it that daily low is one
[47:58] point zero eight zero six in one pipette
[48:02] that's that line right here okay so an
[48:04] hourly chart it breaks down
[48:06] slams below it
[48:08] and look at all this price action in
[48:09] here
[48:11] see all that
[48:12] this is during
[48:13] passover week
[48:15] last week when i wasn't trading
[48:17] and
[48:18] we hit that same low here
[48:21] we rally create a fair value gap there
[48:24] run right back up to the old highs in
[48:26] here
[48:28] and optimal trade entry from the high
[48:31] to the low we went right up into a
[48:34] short-term premium
[48:36] so as a
[48:37] short-term trader going counter-trend
[48:39] remember i was referring to on the
[48:40] dollar index where
[48:42] i have students that are contrarian
[48:45] if i'm long-term bullish on dollar they
[48:48] know where to go in and pick their shots
[48:50] where it looks like
[48:52] retail will see it as a reversal
[48:54] and that's how they made their model
[48:56] so i'm bullish on dollar
[48:58] they'll wait for retail to think that
[49:00] that
[49:01] bullish dollar has topped and then
[49:02] they'll go in and find their setups so
[49:05] hopefully that made it more clear about
[49:06] what i was saying earlier well what
[49:08] would that look like with euro well it
[49:10] would look like this we would have a
[49:12] run back down in to old support which is
[49:14] on daily low
[49:15] rallies creates a fair value gap
[49:18] buy it in here
[49:19] right back above the bodies of these
[49:21] candles into
[49:23] the 62 retracement level because 62 and
[49:25] 79 tracement levels are what i teach is
[49:27] optimal trade entry
[49:30] range but it's not optimal trading entry
[49:32] for the setup okay so in other words we
[49:35] could be a buyer down here
[49:37] and trade back up the 62 percentage
[49:38] level or the bodies okay around around
[49:42] above the bodies of these candles here
[49:44] just pick the 62 tracing level and just
[49:46] make it really easy for yourself
[49:48] but that would be a nice little run in
[49:49] here it's not a lot of pips i mean what
[49:51] is it 20
[49:53] 60 50 it's 10
[49:56] 20. 30
[49:59] ish 30 40 pips thereabouts
[50:02] not bad bread butter type setup but that
[50:04] would be the
[50:05] version of a contrarian trade
[50:08] against the bias that i'm suggesting to
[50:10] my private group which has also been
[50:12] shown to you in the youtube community
[50:14] being
[50:15] bearish on euro until we got below that
[50:17] low here
[50:18] now for the youtube community
[50:20] you're all scratching like okay get to
[50:22] the point where it's going to go where
[50:23] is it going to go next okay this is what
[50:25] i mentioned on monday to my private
[50:27] group now i'm telling you now
[50:29] just because we're doing this style of
[50:31] teaching tonight because i don't have
[50:32] the time to do
[50:34] multiple copies of the same video in my
[50:36] private group then make a youtube video
[50:38] so what i'm choosing to do is make a
[50:40] very very long irritating video that has
[50:42] a lot of information in it for youtube
[50:45] so
[50:47] i don't have a bias at the very moment
[50:50] for europe i don't have a clean level
[50:52] it's going to go to and then reverse
[50:54] okay
[50:55] i've been specific recently and you both
[50:57] communities have known that
[50:59] but right now we're back in that
[51:01] sideways consolidation congestion area
[51:03] and we have to wait for displacement and
[51:05] what does that mean wait for something
[51:06] like this okay if we get it on the
[51:09] upside okay great that's fine it'll give
[51:12] us something to work with in terms of a
[51:13] range if it breaks lower it's fine you
[51:15] will give us something we can work with
[51:16] in terms of a range as well what do i
[51:18] mean by that well from this high that
[51:20] low
[51:22] we went below these lows in here and
[51:23] then we created a short term break in
[51:26] market structure
[51:28] here so this low
[51:31] broken came back down in fill the favor
[51:33] you got spent some time in here a lot of
[51:35] time okay this is typical with a holiday
[51:38] and then starting into a new week it's
[51:41] slow volume and then we get this little
[51:42] bit of movement and we pop right back up
[51:45] into this range high and low
[51:47] fifty percent of it's like right here
[51:50] above 50 we're going to be looking for a
[51:52] premium
[51:53] so 62 the 79 tracement level that would
[51:56] be your objective
[51:58] so
[51:59] if we get a displacement
[52:01] lower
[52:02] i'm going to look for this type of move
[52:04] here just repeated later on
[52:07] vice versa if it goes higher i don't
[52:08] care at this point
[52:10] because it hit my objective my objective
[52:12] was i wanted to see euro go below that
[52:13] low okay this level here on the daily
[52:15] chart since it's done that and i am
[52:19] neutral near-term on dollar i'm still
[52:22] long-term bullish
[52:23] but right now i don't see a setup to go
[52:25] in and say okay now there's something to
[52:26] do
[52:28] now for new traders or new students here
[52:31] that doesn't sound
[52:33] feasible you just said you've been doing
[52:34] this for 30 years you can't find a trade
[52:36] right now
[52:37] not on a daily chart not on the four
[52:39] hour chart and not on the hourly at the
[52:41] very moment at the time of this
[52:42] recording the way the charts are laid
[52:45] out in front of me i have nothing to go
[52:47] on at this very moment
[52:49] that's also another reason why i'd like
[52:51] to do this because
[52:52] i can't really tick off the private
[52:54] community because i'm not really giving
[52:56] this
[52:57] youtube channel
[52:58] the prognostication i usually give them
[53:01] but i'm teaching and lecturing and i'm
[53:03] giving it kind of like a
[53:05] a complaining contrast of what
[53:08] they're getting versus what you all get
[53:10] and neither one of you should be
[53:12] fighting with one another or jealous of
[53:14] another okay because you all had
[53:15] opportunity to join and no one's allowed
[53:17] to do it anymore
[53:18] so
[53:20] let's go on to your dollar 15 minute
[53:22] time frame and you can see here again
[53:24] really nice
[53:26] fair value this is what i was referring
[53:28] to on the hourly chart it's just really
[53:30] clean here
[53:31] on the 15 minute now when i say clean
[53:35] what do i mean by that
[53:37] we have a nice run up here
[53:39] it returns back to that old daily low
[53:41] and then we have what displacement
[53:44] that real energetic run higher
[53:47] that is algorithmic
[53:49] when it creates this gap here
[53:54] we don't care that it's still stretching
[53:55] up here
[53:57] now
[53:58] as a new trader
[54:00] or someone that is impatient that
[54:02] doesn't have an understanding what
[54:03] they're looking for
[54:05] it will feel like an impossibility for
[54:08] them to say
[54:09] i'll wait till it gets back down here
[54:10] and then buy
[54:12] because what will happen is once it does
[54:15] when it trades down like this they're
[54:17] not going to look at that and say oh
[54:18] yeah i feel good about that they're
[54:20] going to think man this thing what
[54:21] happens if it's going down below these
[54:22] equal lows because that's what everybody
[54:24] on youtube is now teaching because i
[54:25] mentioned it
[54:27] no
[54:28] what's the narrative
[54:30] we're short term
[54:32] right now oversold on the daily
[54:36] why because we took out that old daily
[54:38] low
[54:39] we went below it
[54:41] so now it's taken what out of the
[54:42] marketplace sell stops or sell liquidity
[54:45] so what's the market going to look for
[54:46] now
[54:47] buy side liquidity that means it's got
[54:49] to go higher to get that so energetic
[54:51] move off that same daily low and it
[54:53] creates that displacement
[54:55] when it trades back down into that i'm
[54:56] thinking okay well it's created this
[54:58] short term high it's going to want to
[55:00] run back up into that
[55:02] but even if it doesn't
[55:03] if i just get above
[55:05] the bodies of these candles in here
[55:07] and reach up into that 62 retracement
[55:09] level on the hourly chart as i mentioned
[55:11] right before i transitioned to the 15
[55:12] minute time frame we reached up into
[55:14] that 62 treatment level
[55:16] so that would be an opportunity to be a
[55:18] buyer here
[55:19] and sell sure you know not sell short
[55:20] but sell your long there and be done and
[55:23] there's about 30 pips or so
[55:25] that is a bread and butter trade
[55:27] now that is not a style of trade that i
[55:30] would recommend you as a new developing
[55:33] student because it's going against the
[55:36] order flow
[55:37] these are types of moves that you want
[55:38] to go back and back test and then
[55:40] because you're doing that
[55:42] what will happen is over months
[55:45] and years
[55:47] oh here we go
[55:48] he's kicking the cane down the road
[55:49] justifying why his concepts don't work
[55:51] because i can't make him work that means
[55:53] i didn't spend enough time that's his
[55:55] excuse no it's the truth
[55:57] you are going to look for a setup that
[55:59] you watch in a video one time
[56:01] and you're going to expect it to work
[56:03] every single day
[56:05] between
[56:06] 8 30 in the morning and 11 o'clock
[56:08] and because you see what looks like a
[56:10] fair value gap your bias is going to be
[56:12] wrong or your expectation on the daily
[56:14] candle itself the individual daily
[56:16] candle which i'll talk about teach later
[56:17] on this video yes it's an impactful
[56:20] video tonight it may be boring but i got
[56:22] a lot of stuff in this one
[56:25] you're going to do something incorrectly
[56:27] because you're in a rush because you
[56:28] want to feel like
[56:30] you have to know right away it works for
[56:31] you
[56:33] and there is no right of way
[56:35] in trading
[56:36] except for blowing your account because
[56:38] if you don't know what you're doing
[56:40] right away you're going to blow your
[56:41] game okay it's what's going to happen so
[56:43] i talk and i teach like this so that way
[56:45] you know
[56:47] you have been fortified with all these
[56:49] things in advance what to look out for
[56:52] what not to fall victim to how to think
[56:54] about it a mental perspective on what
[56:57] you're doing as a trader and what the
[56:58] market should be doing
[57:00] they have to be in agreement
[57:01] and it takes time for that to happen it
[57:03] doesn't happen by watching a video it
[57:05] doesn't happen in
[57:06] 40 days okay it doesn't happen in
[57:09] 120 days it doesn't happen in the first
[57:12] year it takes a little bit of time so
[57:14] there's a lot of fumbling that you're
[57:15] gonna have to do
[57:17] to
[57:18] figure out what you are looking for
[57:20] because right now if you're just
[57:21] starting
[57:22] i'm promising you right now you have no
[57:25] idea what you want to do and you're
[57:27] probably not realizing that what you're
[57:29] going to evolve into
[57:31] the end results
[57:32] of a speculator what you're doing as a
[57:34] trading model and how you're trading the
[57:36] markets
[57:37] you don't even know what that is yet
[57:40] that's a gradual thing that becomes
[57:46] well
[57:47] obvious
[57:48] to someone that has taken this
[57:50] on as a business not i'm going to school
[57:53] i'm treating this like a college degree
[57:55] well that's good when you first start
[57:57] but you need to treat this like a
[57:58] business
[58:00] are you going to open up a business and
[58:01] just not worry about it every day you're
[58:03] going to be worrying about it every day
[58:04] and you can put all your time and effort
[58:06] into it that's how you should treat this
[58:08] every day whether the transactions that
[58:10] you make are profitable or not they're
[58:13] all learning experiences
[58:15] so that's why back testing is important
[58:16] keeping a trade journal is important
[58:18] annotating your charts and referring
[58:21] back to how it worked off of that daily
[58:23] chart which is what i'll talk about
[58:24] tonight also
[58:27] all right finally made the british pound
[58:29] i'm going to go through this one pretty
[58:29] quick because i've already spent a lot
[58:31] of time jaw boning
[58:33] all right so we had a little bit of a
[58:34] fair bay got here rallied up in that
[58:36] mention we were going to go below that
[58:37] low we did and
[58:39] as i mentioned on monday
[58:42] we would have a
[58:44] consolidation type sloppy type price
[58:46] action environment where we're
[58:49] not yet out of the holiday doldrum last
[58:51] week a lot of money was on the sidelines
[58:54] so we're waiting for
[58:56] the smart money to put things in motion
[58:59] and then it'll give us another bias as
[59:01] to what we're looking for i'm
[59:02] maintaining
[59:03] a
[59:04] bearish stance on
[59:06] british pound versus us dollar because i
[59:08] have a long-term bullish stance on
[59:10] dollar so everything i think eventually
[59:13] will bend the knee and go lower like
[59:14] euro
[59:15] pound aussie you know all those
[59:17] currencies should go lower
[59:20] if i'm wrong it'll trade above the fair
[59:23] value gap if it does i'm wrong
[59:25] as long as we're below the fair value
[59:26] gap here i'm bearish on cable
[59:30] and for new people cable is
[59:32] pound versus dollars is the nickname for
[59:34] it all right so here is the hourly chart
[59:36] i'm just going to make it very simple
[59:38] sweet to the point there's nothing here
[59:40] absolutely zero nothing in this chart
[59:43] nothing
[59:44] to trade on not one thing
[59:47] i can't look at this and say oh i gotta
[59:48] set up here or i could do that there's
[59:50] nothing
[59:51] okay nothing here at all
[59:54] take a deep breath and hear that again
[59:56] there's nothing
[59:58] on this chart
[59:59] that's noteworthy
[60:01] now think about that
[60:07] does it feel comfortable
[60:10] for somebody it doesn't feel comfortable
[60:11] it's like what
[60:12] there's got to be no there's nothing
[60:14] here
[60:15] that's the difference between what i
[60:17] mentioned when i was looking at the
[60:18] 15-minute time frame on euro
[60:21] i said how nice and clean it was
[60:23] there's nothing clean in this price
[60:24] action it's all back and forth back and
[60:26] forth it's sloppy price action okay when
[60:28] i say things are sloppy this is it
[60:30] there's nothing that you can very easily
[60:34] pick out as okay it's bullish it's gonna
[60:37] pull down to a specific level and i
[60:39] expect it to rally from there i don't
[60:40] have any of that here nothing's in this
[60:42] chart that's noteworthy or what i would
[60:45] ever put money behind
[60:47] so when it looks like this
[60:49] we roll along
[60:51] here is the 15-minute timeframe
[60:54] sloppy
[60:55] nothing here
[60:56] so
[60:57] when you go through your charts
[60:59] if the marketplace that you're looking
[61:01] at creates these scenarios where it's
[61:02] just really messy
[61:04] what's the first thing you should
[61:05] consider
[61:06] closing the charts turning your computer
[61:08] off and go do something you love to do
[61:10] spend time with your family good friends
[61:13] and
[61:14] hobby chasing whatever it is you're
[61:16] doing otherwise outside of the markets
[61:18] which is what all of you should have a
[61:19] hobby outside of this not just watch my
[61:22] videos or someone else's stuff
[61:24] have something you do outside of trading
[61:26] because you have to have an outlet and
[61:29] otherwise you're going to burn out but
[61:30] when the markets look like this you
[61:32] don't touch them
[61:33] i'm not talking about my community knows
[61:35] that i have not been
[61:37] really
[61:38] and it breaks my heart because this has
[61:39] always been my favorite pair
[61:41] but i have not been touching british
[61:43] pound
[61:44] for a long time months
[61:46] months
[61:47] have gone by i've not done one trade in
[61:50] this currency pair because this is
[61:52] simply not delivering what i'm looking
[61:54] for now some of you are thinking there's
[61:56] proof right there they're changing the
[61:58] algorithm no
[61:59] it's just a mess right now
[62:02] the whole world's all messed up
[62:04] and trade
[62:06] has been affected by that
[62:08] so
[62:10] it's going to show its hand
[62:12] and manifest itself in the currencies
[62:14] and this is what you have
[62:15] trust me folks
[62:17] in the offing
[62:19] just over the horizon there's something
[62:21] about to happen
[62:23] and when that happens
[62:25] these markets are gonna get real real
[62:28] excited and they're gonna be moving
[62:29] around a lot and everybody's gonna be
[62:31] like man i'm gonna go and trade forex
[62:33] trust me that day's coming what day is
[62:36] it exactly i don't know but i'm being
[62:38] patient until it manifests itself when
[62:40] it does you're going to know it
[62:42] everybody's going to know it but when
[62:44] that creates that
[62:46] man it's going to be what i call salad
[62:49] days it just means easy trading so don't
[62:52] don't get bummed out by looking at this
[62:54] and thinking oh this is actually a good
[62:55] thing because it teaches you when not to
[62:58] be doing anything
[63:01] when it feels alien it feels
[63:04] counterintuitive or counterproductive or
[63:06] the opposite of what you're in here
[63:08] learning about you're thinking i'm
[63:11] learning how to do this so i should be
[63:12] able to open up a chart and go and find
[63:14] a setup yes that's reasonable for a
[63:17] neophyte but you want to learn how to do
[63:19] this
[63:20] profitably right i mean i would hope you
[63:22] would want that
[63:23] you want to do things consistently right
[63:25] hopefully that's what you're trying to
[63:27] do
[63:27] i'm trying to promote that in you maybe
[63:29] that's not what you thought about when
[63:30] you first started but you want to be
[63:32] able to know why you're doing something
[63:35] and when not to do it
[63:37] knowing when not to do something is
[63:39] crucial because it'll keep you from
[63:42] blowing your account it'll keep you from
[63:44] being
[63:45] undisciplined
[63:46] and it'll give you peace of mind it'll
[63:49] remove that fear of missing out
[63:51] i don't have any fear of missing any of
[63:52] this
[63:53] price action here
[63:55] it's not gonna i'm not losing any sleep
[63:57] over it
[63:58] and you shouldn't either and when your
[64:00] market whatever that market is is
[64:03] performing like this
[64:04] just leave it alone take a break
[64:07] you don't need to trade today
[64:09] you don't need to trade tomorrow if you
[64:11] feel that
[64:13] understand this and listen okay
[64:16] put the potato chips down
[64:18] put your drink down
[64:19] listen
[64:22] you do not need
[64:24] to trade every single day
[64:27] despite what you're thinking and feeling
[64:30] you don't
[64:32] what you need to do is understand why
[64:35] today or tomorrow is a day that's highly
[64:38] probable
[64:40] that your bias will deliver
[64:43] to a target that you already know is
[64:45] likely to be treated too and i'll talk
[64:47] about that later in the video
[64:49] but you have to have an expectation of
[64:50] where it's going to go
[64:52] where is it going next higher or lower
[64:55] if you can't
[64:56] reasonably outline that
[65:01] then you're gambling
[65:04] and if you're trying to trade every day
[65:05] or you have this impulse that you have
[65:08] to be treating you have to be in there
[65:10] you have to be doing it
[65:13] that's a gambler's mentality
[65:16] i do not promote gamblers
[65:18] i do not promote gambling i do not
[65:20] promote over leveraging i do not promote
[65:23] lucky
[65:25] over leverage trading
[65:28] i promote
[65:30] one contract
[65:32] work on trying to double your account
[65:34] how long does it take i don't know
[65:36] how long is it going to take you i don't
[65:37] know
[65:38] but that should be your goal
[65:41] work with the lowest leverage and try to
[65:43] double your account
[65:44] if you don't have the patience to do
[65:46] that
[65:47] you're a gambler
[65:50] you're trying to rush to make big money
[65:52] and there's only one end result that
[65:54] comes from that
[65:55] you blow your account
[65:57] i'm telling you folks if you don't
[65:59] believe me
[66:00] watch when you try to do it
[66:02] and you're going to be coming back and
[66:04] saying in the comment section
[66:05] you were right i wish i would have
[66:06] listened
[66:08] and then the true test is will you
[66:09] repeat the same error
[66:11] thinking you're just
[66:13] weren't
[66:14] schooled enough yet okay you didn't have
[66:16] the skill set yet now you do because you
[66:18] watch two more videos and then you do it
[66:20] again
[66:21] then you'll write in the comment section
[66:23] i just blew my account because i didn't
[66:24] do this and i didn't do that what's
[66:26] wrong with me
[66:28] i'm telling you what's wrong with you
[66:30] you're rushing
[66:31] and you're gambling
[66:33] and i don't teach that so you're doing
[66:35] what
[66:36] everything i'm telling you not to do
[66:39] so are you really ready to be taught
[66:42] no
[66:44] once you break yourself and you have no
[66:46] more money in your account
[66:48] and you have no more money to put back
[66:49] in the account
[66:50] and you are questioning whether or not
[66:52] trading is for you
[66:54] that
[66:55] that is the student that's ready
[66:58] because they have nothing to go in and
[67:00] gamble with
[67:02] and it's all up from there
[67:04] or they say trading is not for me and
[67:07] guess what
[67:08] that's the right decision
[67:10] because you know yourself better than
[67:12] anyone else
[67:13] if you
[67:14] decide that you know what
[67:17] i've tried this i've tried that it isn't
[67:19] working
[67:20] trading is not for me well god bless you
[67:22] you've probably saved yourself a fortune
[67:24] because there's a lot of people that
[67:26] this will never work for because they
[67:29] are not disciplined they're not
[67:31] responsible they're not going to they're
[67:33] not going to follow the rules and
[67:34] they're not going to do things as they
[67:36] were taught
[67:37] and they'll find fault with everything
[67:39] but themselves
[67:41] and that is mental illness
[67:44] i experienced it
[67:46] i know it firsthand
[67:48] and it's painful
[67:50] it's embarrassing it is
[67:53] deflating it feels
[67:56] horrible
[67:58] but
[67:58] it's not permanent
[68:01] it's absolutely corrected by certain
[68:04] things and skill sets replacing bad
[68:06] habits that's all
[68:08] but it takes responsible discipline
[68:11] and a routine and adhering to it and
[68:14] being accountable to someone
[68:16] who is that someone you trust say look
[68:19] this is how i'm going to be doing
[68:20] my studies in my trading and i just want
[68:22] to show you what what i'm doing
[68:24] and it's better if you're in a community
[68:28] that is like-minded and that's what i
[68:30] try to foster i try to create that and
[68:32] unfortunately what happens is people on
[68:34] the outside that usually take shots at
[68:36] me or you think this or that
[68:38] about what i do what i teach or my
[68:40] students
[68:41] they'll say it's a cult
[68:43] when all i'm trying to do is empower
[68:45] that individual to be an independent
[68:46] thinker i don't want you to believe me
[68:49] or anything i'm saying i want you to go
[68:51] in look at these markets with the lens
[68:54] i'm providing you
[68:56] if i'm a fraud and these don't work
[68:58] you're going to know right away
[69:00] if you're really putting the effort in
[69:02] you're going to know right away if these
[69:04] things are valid or not
[69:05] but
[69:06] for those that have done the work
[69:09] nobody's convincing them otherwise now
[69:11] that it absolutely is the truth
[69:13] and it's consistent but when i say
[69:15] consistent that's not the same thing as
[69:19] it happens every single day
[69:21] in the same pair that you look at like
[69:24] for instance none of the things i'm
[69:25] teaching
[69:26] are existing in this pair right now
[69:28] that's why my private group and none of
[69:30] you have seen anything with this pair
[69:31] from me for a long long time
[69:34] because it's not
[69:36] showing clear clean price action so
[69:40] since it's not doing it i take my hand
[69:42] off of it and my attention goes
[69:43] elsewhere
[69:44] where has it been diverted to
[69:46] index futures
[69:48] index futures will have this type of
[69:50] price action soon
[69:53] does it mean that
[69:54] index futures trading is dead no
[69:58] does it mean the algorithm has stopped
[69:59] working no it just means that it's being
[70:02] heavily manipulated so what does that
[70:05] mean for you internally don't touch it
[70:07] this is a rattlesnake if you see a
[70:10] rattlesnake on a trail and you're
[70:11] walking down there and you hear that
[70:14] rattle i've never seen a rattlesnake
[70:17] live in front of me okay but i'm telling
[70:19] you what i'd recognize it if it started
[70:20] rallying and i'm gonna stand still
[70:23] and i'm gonna look around and find it
[70:25] and wherever it is i'm backing away from
[70:27] it
[70:28] simple
[70:29] well i treat these times
[70:31] in the marketplace just like that
[70:33] because there were times where i looked
[70:35] at this and said i'm better than average
[70:37] bear i'll get in here and find the honey
[70:40] well there you go i got stung
[70:45] that's why i'm talking to you like this
[70:46] folks
[70:48] you gave me your time you gave me your
[70:50] ear
[70:51] and you're giving me your trust
[70:54] i'm giving you the best advice
[70:57] anybody could ever give you
[71:00] don't discount it as just
[71:04] talking
[71:05] droning on
[71:07] pontification
[71:10] no
[71:10] this is real insight folks it's three
[71:12] decades of it i lost a lot of money not
[71:14] doing what i'm teaching you
[71:16] to
[71:18] do like i'm teaching you the very things
[71:20] that i fell victim to and how to avoid
[71:23] it
[71:25] wouldn't you want to do that
[71:27] i mean i i would literally
[71:30] give everything i had back in 1992 if i
[71:33] had someone
[71:34] like i'm trying to be for all of you
[71:37] i'm trying to be that person that has
[71:40] real world experience
[71:42] that knows what's going on proves it
[71:45] and i'm trying to show you
[71:47] lower your expectations on yourself
[71:49] don't try to be an olympic trader okay
[71:51] you don't need to be olympic
[71:53] just be consistent if you find a bread
[71:55] and butter set up once a week
[71:58] you can do a lot with that
[72:00] it just takes
[72:01] consistency
[72:03] and money management the money
[72:04] management does the heavy lifting
[72:06] the the hardest thing is finding
[72:08] something you're going to trust and stay
[72:09] with
[72:10] and when it doesn't deliver or when you
[72:12] can't find it in your market
[72:14] it doesn't change it it just means you
[72:16] stand still
[72:17] that's it
[72:19] and it's hard
[72:20] it's real hard because what happens if
[72:22] you go
[72:23] two weeks without taking a trade
[72:25] what's that going to do for your mindset
[72:27] for some of you it's going to try to be
[72:29] nuts
[72:30] others
[72:31] it's going to make you want to change
[72:33] the style of trading
[72:35] and they're both wrong
[72:40] 30 years taught me that
[72:42] books didn't teach me that
[72:45] books talked about system hopping but
[72:48] you don't really know that lesson until
[72:50] you blow accounts
[72:52] do dozens of different trading styles
[72:54] and approaches
[72:55] that don't work
[72:56] they have no sound logic in the
[72:58] marketplace why it's doing this and
[72:59] doing that diversions indicator this
[73:01] harmonic that all those things
[73:06] are something that promotes the idea of
[73:08] a religious view on the marketplace and
[73:10] not just time and price
[73:12] time and price is not a religion
[73:15] it's the truth that's what these markets
[73:17] deliver on
[73:18] look at the chart what's
[73:20] what's at the bottom of the chart
[73:22] time
[73:23] what's on the vertical axis
[73:25] price
[73:27] why are you complicating it you're
[73:29] saying i'm complicating it why are you
[73:31] you're adding triangles and shapes and
[73:34] all these things and moving averages and
[73:36] all this stuff on your chart instead of
[73:38] just looking at what these
[73:39] candlesticks are documenting
[73:41] where was it
[73:43] an hour ago where was it last friday
[73:47] was it likely go
[73:49] today where is it likely to go by the
[73:50] end of the week
[73:52] if you ask those questions every single
[73:54] time you sit in front of the charts
[73:56] you'll have a pretty good idea of what
[73:58] it's likely to do what happened every
[74:00] single time no
[74:01] but by itself that right there was just
[74:03] mentioned to you
[74:05] that was the first steps for me to stop
[74:07] looking at those books
[74:10] those books are going to tell you things
[74:12] that ninety percent of people that trade
[74:15] lose money on
[74:17] let's be let's be honest folks let's
[74:19] just call it like it is okay
[74:22] all of those books
[74:24] all those teachers all these youtube
[74:26] channels everybody out there is talking
[74:28] about the same things
[74:31] that result in the 90 percent blowout
[74:36] of live traders
[74:41] so why are you holding on to that stuff
[74:43] with a death grip
[74:45] no no no
[74:46] it's gonna work for me
[74:48] i did that same thing
[74:51] and i lost
[74:53] blue accounts over and over again crying
[74:56] tears weeping
[74:59] why can't i figure it out those things
[75:01] are in a 90 percent bracket of losing
[75:04] money
[75:08] if you walk down road
[75:11] and you see these
[75:13] glasses of water
[75:16] free to drink
[75:19] you walk over here you pick it up
[75:20] you sniff it just doesn't feel right and
[75:23] you take a step back and watch other
[75:24] people walk over and they assume they
[75:25] take a drink they start choking and drop
[75:27] dead right there
[75:29] how many
[75:30] people
[75:31] do you need to see pick up that glass
[75:33] take a drink and drop dead before you
[75:35] realize it's probably not a good idea
[75:36] for you to have a swig
[75:41] but unfortunately
[75:42] marketing is
[75:45] what it is okay there's always some
[75:47] clever little way gimmicks is what they
[75:49] are
[75:50] of making it seem like there's this new
[75:52] twist on something old
[75:54] okay
[75:55] and
[75:57] bad logic no matter how much lipstick
[75:59] you put on it is still bad logic
[76:02] and you can't change that
[76:03] so
[76:05] the idea is for you to find it in the
[76:08] price action
[76:09] the things you're looking for on the
[76:10] chart or in price action they must
[76:12] appear clearly
[76:14] in price
[76:15] and if it's not clear
[76:17] if it's real muddy and just choppy like
[76:19] this it's indicating to you that this is
[76:21] not a market the smart money is going to
[76:23] sit down and say yes we're going to
[76:25] operate today
[76:26] it's heavily manipulated it's not being
[76:28] allowed to trade freely it's held
[76:32] so if it's being held and manipulated do
[76:34] you want to be in there
[76:36] because if you are doing that you're
[76:38] gambling
[76:40] so don't do that
[76:44] all right so we made it to
[76:46] the futures portion of this long-winded
[76:49] video about nonsense right
[76:52] all right so
[76:54] daily chart on the e-mini s p all right
[76:56] so we have the market trading down into
[76:58] a very very deep discount if you look at
[76:59] the
[77:00] range low here
[77:02] why am i not picking this one here
[77:04] because this move started
[77:06] there okay that's what i'm looking at
[77:08] this move these are relatively equal
[77:10] lows so i'm just going to move over to
[77:11] the most recent swing low why is this
[77:14] swing low it will candle to the left of
[77:15] it that has a higher load than this one
[77:17] and the candle to the right of it has a
[77:19] higher low than that one so that swing
[77:20] low
[77:21] that one here
[77:23] to here that's my daily dealing range
[77:26] okay the market has recently retraced
[77:28] back down in about fifty percent
[77:30] equilibrium of that price move okay so
[77:32] that's what we're annotating here about
[77:34] halfway is what really essentially is
[77:35] being shown
[77:37] and also
[77:39] because of that
[77:40] the market is likely to
[77:42] create a little bit of a retracement now
[77:45] on this video i did a teaching called
[77:47] purge and revert
[77:49] okay and
[77:50] i'm going to talk a little bit about
[77:51] that tonight and how it's a little
[77:53] somewhat of a variation on that idea and
[77:55] premise
[77:56] but
[77:57] i want you to think about how the market
[77:59] created this
[78:02] low here
[78:03] and then the reaction and price delivery
[78:05] on this day
[78:06] here on the 19th
[78:09] and on monday night i was mentioning to
[78:12] my private group and you all know i
[78:14] mentioned this i'm actually going to put
[78:17] a clip from monday's video in here so
[78:19] that way the folks that were not in that
[78:21] group they would have the
[78:23] and
[78:25] the insights that was mentioned there
[78:26] that way you can see what i'm showing
[78:28] here is not pointing to something that
[78:30] after the fact i wanted you the both
[78:32] communities to appreciate what i'm
[78:34] teaching
[78:35] not to beat the chess not to show off
[78:37] not to say on smart okay but i want you
[78:39] to understand what i'm showing you here
[78:41] is rooted on sound logic it's not chance
[78:44] it's not gambling
[78:46] so because this daily chart has retraced
[78:48] down into about half of the move from
[78:50] that low that high so we basically went
[78:52] back to equilibrium or roughly a short
[78:54] term what discount so because of that
[78:58] there's a likelihood that the daily bias
[79:00] is going to be bullish
[79:03] on this day here and this here
[79:06] now
[79:07] we're going to look at this candle
[79:09] because
[79:10] midpoint of this candle
[79:13] that right there is the mean threshold
[79:14] mean threshold is the half
[79:16] point okay
[79:18] or median of
[79:20] a order block that's what this line here
[79:23] is representing
[79:24] okay so when i drop down into the hourly
[79:26] and lower time frame
[79:28] that right there is rooted on this up
[79:30] close candle why am i using that up
[79:32] close candle because from this high down
[79:35] into the 50 retracement of that low and
[79:38] high where the market goes back to
[79:40] equilibrium or short-term discount that
[79:42] means the bias has a likelihood now
[79:44] folks listen
[79:46] you want to be taught about bias i'm
[79:48] teaching it
[79:49] listen
[79:50] it went down to equilibrium or
[79:52] short-term
[79:53] discount
[79:54] the next day
[79:57] we can expect it to go higher
[79:59] so what do we do with that information
[80:01] if it's likely to go higher the next day
[80:03] or the day after that
[80:05] what happens if the next day is down or
[80:07] if it doesn't move okay you go into the
[80:09] next day expecting it to go higher
[80:10] that's it that's all you're doing
[80:12] it's not hard right
[80:14] but you want perfect
[80:16] you want your recipe
[80:18] for those chocolate chip cookies to come
[80:20] out like grandma's and sometimes guess
[80:22] what it isn't going to be like that
[80:24] you're going to have to take it
[80:26] the way it gives it to you and sometimes
[80:29] your cookies ain't going to rise this
[80:32] just so happens that
[80:34] what i outlined on monday
[80:36] panned out but that's what i'm referring
[80:38] to every single week
[80:39] i'm outlining something
[80:41] that
[80:42] because of the logic
[80:44] that's that one good setup that you
[80:46] should be focusing on as my students
[80:49] what am i going to show you here in this
[80:53] this is your premium array that means
[80:56] it's going to draw up into that it could
[80:58] be this candle is low
[80:59] because it's the order block they are
[81:00] shorter block
[81:03] why
[81:04] should i be concerned about this candle
[81:06] because in this move here right before
[81:08] this displacement on the downside this
[81:10] was the last up closed candle
[81:12] so you have several targets here you
[81:14] have the
[81:16] candle low
[81:17] the open
[81:18] the mean threshold half the order block
[81:21] and you have the high the high is the
[81:23] less likely
[81:24] the easiest is one down here
[81:27] so on this candle here when we expect it
[81:29] to go higher we can see it trade up into
[81:32] that candle's low
[81:33] we can see it trade up into that
[81:34] candle's body
[81:36] we can see it straight up into that
[81:37] candles mean threshold
[81:39] so
[81:40] it's not a matter of me picking levels
[81:42] and saying look how smart i am
[81:44] look it hit that level but what about
[81:47] those other levels you didn't see
[81:49] for those people that think like that or
[81:51] if you ever hear that or see people talk
[81:52] like that here's what you respond to
[81:54] internally don't even worry about them
[81:56] because
[81:57] they're not interested in learning all
[81:58] they're trying to do is
[82:00] be a distraction to you
[82:03] i promise you if you put the work in you
[82:05] will see the results
[82:08] you're looking for the lowest
[82:10] hanging fruit which one's the easiest
[82:12] for you now if you look at that in
[82:14] respect to this candle here so if you're
[82:16] buying on this day if you're buying down
[82:18] here below the opening which i'm going
[82:20] to teach in detail
[82:22] in this video if you're buying down
[82:25] below the opening
[82:26] not that i use this particular opening
[82:28] price but let's say you did say you
[82:30] bought this
[82:32] specific day below that opening price on
[82:33] that candle right there and you were
[82:35] buying below you could find
[82:37] profitability
[82:38] reaching just up into that candle's low
[82:41] draw that out in time
[82:43] you can use the body draw that out in
[82:44] time here hits it well today not
[82:47] yesterday's trading because that was
[82:48] yesterday's stream and you have this
[82:50] here
[82:52] being
[82:53] hit there and he had the mean threshold
[82:55] of the order block there so there's
[82:56] several targets
[82:58] now for you as a developing student you
[83:00] want to pick the easiest one which is
[83:01] this one here
[83:02] and be content if it hits that
[83:04] now blending that with the idea of purge
[83:08] and revert now purge and revert you can
[83:10] do a youtube search on that it's in my
[83:12] youtube channel
[83:13] it's a teaching that i'm going to allow
[83:15] you to go back and look at yourself but
[83:17] it's kind of built on that same premise
[83:19] here we went down
[83:21] we took out short term low sell side
[83:23] liquidity see that
[83:25] right below here so we purged cell stops
[83:28] and it's going to revert back to the
[83:30] high in the last three days
[83:31] so day one two three that's this day
[83:35] here
[83:36] so this candle is high
[83:38] it can draw back into so we have the s
[83:40] this
[83:41] quarter block low
[83:42] but then we have this idea here where
[83:45] the move dropping down
[83:48] that high is going to have what resting
[83:50] above it
[83:52] buy stops why would there be buy stops
[83:54] there because traders that are short
[83:57] they're going to trail their stop loss
[83:58] right there
[83:59] it's going to be more easily understood
[84:01] when we're dropping the lower time
[84:02] frames but just know that that's the
[84:03] framework i'm showing here you are going
[84:05] to have to listen to this part of the
[84:07] video a few times
[84:09] don't be
[84:10] against that okay don't don't feel like
[84:13] i don't want to do that trust me put the
[84:15] time in to listen to this portion of the
[84:16] video because this is exactly what
[84:19] nobody is teaching you because they
[84:21] don't know it but this is what goes on
[84:24] and it's also the reason why i told my
[84:25] private group on monday night what took
[84:28] place yesterday
[84:31] all right so we're dropping down to the
[84:32] hourly chart and here is the e-mini s p
[84:35] june contract
[84:38] market traded down into that
[84:39] short term low ran out sell stops here
[84:42] or sell side liquidity so it purged that
[84:44] liquidity then we had all this
[84:46] sloppiness
[84:47] starting the week and then we dropped
[84:49] down
[84:50] and rallied up doesn't look too clean
[84:53] and clear in here and does it it's okay
[84:55] it's about to change we're going to drop
[84:57] down the lower time frame because we
[84:58] have a bias
[85:00] i mentioned on monday
[85:02] that i felt that this was going to go
[85:03] higher and clear up all this here
[85:06] and that was the draw on liquidity
[85:08] now here's that part of the video i said
[85:10] when we get into the discussion about
[85:12] live sessions what am i going to be
[85:14] doing
[85:15] basically what i'm going to show you a
[85:16] clip of when i get to the 15 minute time
[85:19] frame i'm going to show you the clip
[85:21] from monday night's private mentorship
[85:23] video where i discuss before it happened
[85:26] where the e-mini s p was likely to go
[85:29] why i felt it was likely to happen and
[85:31] i'm going to amplify that here so that
[85:32] way both communities can appreciate what
[85:34] it is that i'm going to be doing with
[85:35] intraday price action
[85:39] the guys over in goldman sachs
[85:42] and you've been with me for a while you
[85:43] know who i'm talking about uh they like
[85:45] to say that intraday is just noise and
[85:48] one of those guys actually said he tried
[85:49] very hard to make it work and if anybody
[85:51] tells you the injury trading is
[85:54] profitable and you can do it
[85:54] consistently run away from them because
[85:56] they're a con artist okay
[85:58] it's kind of funny that you know
[86:00] i'm proving
[86:02] technical science okay because it exists
[86:06] it repeats but you have to know what
[86:07] you're looking for okay and
[86:10] i'm going to show you that here
[86:12] i mentioned the opening price
[86:15] on the midnight candle and i mentioned
[86:17] the opening price at 8 30 and there's a
[86:19] lot of confusion as to what that means
[86:21] and what am i supposed to be doing with
[86:22] that information i'm going to cover that
[86:23] in this video too but i want you to look
[86:25] at this hourly chart
[86:27] and just see this movement here
[86:30] to here see that
[86:33] you don't have any reference points
[86:36] inside the hourly chart here that's okay
[86:38] i'm going to show it to you
[86:41] in amplification to what i was showing
[86:43] my group on monday night
[86:44] before it happened
[86:47] do you see how level these two highs are
[86:49] here
[86:50] see that
[86:52] this is what i dub relative equal highs
[86:54] that right there
[86:56] engineers
[86:58] buy stops
[86:59] for anyone that chases this going
[87:03] they're lower
[87:03] to think that this is the area where
[87:05] resistance is so their stop will be
[87:07] placed above that
[87:09] does it take rocket science to
[87:10] understand that no
[87:12] every book tells every trader that reads
[87:14] the book that stops get above the old
[87:17] high
[87:18] and this is resistance because it went
[87:20] here stopped went lower it tried one
[87:22] more time here and then went lower so
[87:25] this is
[87:26] strong resistance now
[87:29] granted
[87:30] i'm not trying to make a case the hourly
[87:32] timeframe is strong okay
[87:35] but there's a lot of people that trade
[87:36] these lower time frames and they'll see
[87:37] that as what
[87:40] formidable resistance
[87:42] so they'll feel that this is safe the
[87:44] market should keep going lower they
[87:45] broke this low so that means it's going
[87:47] to keep going lower and when price
[87:48] starts going sideways like this slightly
[87:50] up it's going to look like what to them
[87:52] it's a bear flag
[87:54] so they're going to look at this high
[87:55] down to that level and project that same
[87:57] movement lower as a measured move
[87:59] and this type of thing happens
[88:02] because they didn't use the contacts
[88:04] that i'm providing you
[88:05] both communities understanding how the
[88:07] markets move from discount to premium
[88:09] premium to discount that's it
[88:12] and then what pd arrays within the
[88:14] current market structure
[88:16] and what narrative
[88:18] so what is narrative what is that
[88:22] well
[88:23] we have the market trading down into
[88:25] that short term low
[88:26] below old lows about 50 of its daily
[88:29] range
[88:30] that i mentioned on the daily timeframe
[88:33] so we purged the sale stops
[88:35] where is it going to go
[88:37] higher why it needs to go to buy side
[88:39] because it's now collected sell stops so
[88:42] smart money is going to do what
[88:44] offset those buy orders that they used
[88:47] to pair up with the sell stops below
[88:49] these lows they bought those sales
[88:51] valves so now they're net long how do
[88:53] they get out
[88:54] they have to sell them to willing buyers
[88:57] but at this point down here and over
[88:59] here
[89:00] who's going to be buying from them at a
[89:01] higher price
[89:03] the value stops that are resting about
[89:05] here
[89:06] so you have to think algorithmically how
[89:08] do you pair your orders
[89:10] if you don't have this mindset going in
[89:12] before you click the enter button of
[89:14] your trade
[89:16] you are gambling
[89:18] you have no idea what you're doing
[89:20] you're trying to guess you're in there
[89:22] seeing
[89:23] what would happen if i did this
[89:25] and then when it works you're telling
[89:27] yourself wow if i did that with real
[89:29] money i could quit my job in three
[89:30] months wrong
[89:32] and when it's bad you're thinking oh
[89:34] well i wouldn't have took that trade
[89:35] anyway
[89:36] i'm really cool and astute i'm
[89:39] an apt pupil of price action
[89:42] no
[89:43] you're a gambler you're dabbling with a
[89:45] demo account and you're not learning
[89:47] anything you're conditioning yourself
[89:49] to believe
[89:51] that these sensations that you feel
[89:54] when it's right it's skill
[89:56] and when it's not
[89:57] well that was just you just playing
[89:59] around you weren't really doing anything
[90:01] serious about it
[90:03] and that creates toxic thinking and it
[90:06] builds a false sense of security and
[90:10] in certain instances
[90:12] some individuals literally go out and
[90:14] say well i'm going to put live money in
[90:15] there because
[90:16] you know i got lucky a couple times and
[90:18] i could afford uh you know a couple
[90:21] thousand dollars and i could do this and
[90:22] i could do that if i made that
[90:25] and that's what that's what everybody
[90:26] does they fall victim to that
[90:29] i don't want you doing that you have to
[90:30] have a real reason why you're doing
[90:32] something
[90:33] even in demo
[90:34] otherwise you're teaching yourself
[90:36] to think
[90:39] well
[90:40] and properly about what it is that
[90:41] you're trying to do in these
[90:42] marketplaces
[90:44] so the logic is we're looking for to run
[90:46] about here
[90:47] and now think about that in this area
[90:50] here
[90:51] here's the 19th
[90:53] on tuesday
[90:54] i told the group that it was likely to
[90:56] go to here
[90:58] and i'll show you that clip when we drop
[91:00] into 15 minute timeframe but they'll
[91:01] think about what does your daily candle
[91:03] look like if it's going to likely go up
[91:05] to here and we're down here
[91:07] it's going to create what a little bit
[91:09] of a movement down
[91:11] make the low of the day
[91:13] then rally up to clean that little well
[91:16] and we're not trying to predict the
[91:17] closing price on the daily candle we're
[91:19] not trying to do that
[91:20] we're trying to participate in a move
[91:23] in the morning session that gets us long
[91:26] that allows us to run up into this area
[91:28] here
[91:29] and that would be your target you're not
[91:31] trying to get the move that goes all the
[91:33] way up to 45 90 if it was to do
[91:35] something like that i'm not suggesting
[91:36] it is but i'm saying that
[91:38] you have to pick these periods in the
[91:40] marketplace where it makes sense for you
[91:42] to anticipate and expect a certain move
[91:45] to begin and originate in and where it
[91:47] ends or where it finds its terminus
[91:49] so
[91:52] point of origin
[91:53] terminus
[91:55] buy orders on smart money
[91:58] sell orders
[92:00] on smart money
[92:02] retail buy orders
[92:05] retail sell orders
[92:08] that's the continuum
[92:10] that goes between smart money and retail
[92:14] you have to change your
[92:16] thought process about what you're
[92:17] looking at in the charts and that is
[92:19] narrative
[92:22] looking for the daily delivery on that
[92:23] candle judas swing buy below the opening
[92:26] price
[92:27] expect displacement to the upside run
[92:29] into
[92:30] liquidity
[92:32] offset
[92:33] sell to buyers
[92:34] move to the sidelines you're done
[92:37] now what does that look like on a lower
[92:39] time frame
[92:41] here's the 15 minute time frame
[92:43] here is the relative equal highs buy
[92:45] side liquidity wrestling there
[92:48] look at this price action in here
[92:50] what do you see
[92:52] pause the video this is that moment
[92:54] where you want to study and look at it
[93:01] okay i'm going to continue now
[93:04] all right so here we have
[93:06] this low why am i picking that low why
[93:09] not that low michael why didn't you pick
[93:10] this low michael
[93:12] this here is a range that we worked in
[93:14] and i mentioned this is brutal when i
[93:16] was discussing it with my
[93:18] students on monday and it's commentary
[93:21] but this movement here this is the most
[93:22] recent swing low it rallied up and it
[93:24] created a higher height right above
[93:26] these relative equal highs so there
[93:28] that 0.1 to 0.2 that's your dealing
[93:30] range okay
[93:32] i'm using that because it's the most
[93:33] energetic most recent low and high
[93:38] this is where i think the market's going
[93:40] to go up to
[93:41] because i think all of this movement
[93:43] down here
[93:44] basically has accumulated
[93:46] all the cell stops
[93:48] so now
[93:49] smart money's heavily net long
[93:52] and they are sitting on all these
[93:56] you know
[93:58] counterparty traders
[93:59] that either were knocked down the
[94:01] marketplace and they absorbed all of
[94:03] their cell stops
[94:05] or
[94:06] they're caught offside and retail is
[94:08] trying to go lower
[94:10] it doesn't make a difference i'm not
[94:12] suggesting that you should even waste
[94:13] any time trying to figure out what that
[94:15] is i'm just saying that below old lows
[94:17] sell stocks below old highs is buy
[94:18] stocks just have it in mind it's just
[94:20] that simple
[94:22] now
[94:23] knowing that by itself is not enough you
[94:25] need to know what is likely to occur
[94:28] here is the midnight
[94:30] candle in new york
[94:32] okay
[94:33] how do you know that over here on
[94:35] trading view click this little area down
[94:36] here it'll pop up a list of time zones
[94:38] and such scroll to new york always put
[94:41] your trading view chart on new york i
[94:43] don't care where you live you do that
[94:45] everything i'm teaching you will line up
[94:48] midnight opening price the opening price
[94:50] is here
[94:51] draw that out in time
[94:53] and that's your new york midnight
[94:54] opening price
[94:56] this is the price i want to preferably
[94:58] be buying below now there are instances
[95:01] where the opening price will be lower
[95:04] and then the market is trading higher
[95:06] but doesn't go back below the midnight
[95:08] opening price
[95:10] this is why i said 8 30 opening price 8
[95:13] 30 is when a news embargo lifts and a
[95:15] lot of news comes in around 8 30
[95:17] typically
[95:19] and i use that opening price there now
[95:21] in this instance this is why i'm
[95:23] teaching it to both groups today because
[95:25] this is kind of like a
[95:27] just a
[95:28] dandy of a setup means it's really good
[95:31] i like these types of setups i'm going
[95:32] to show you here when it delivers
[95:34] something like this it's almost like
[95:36] it's presenting it to you on a silver
[95:38] platter like if you really really want a
[95:40] good little
[95:41] setup that's going to just just be a
[95:43] real nice cracker jacket just delivers
[95:45] nicely it's this one here okay
[95:48] if we're bullish
[95:50] okay and i'm assuming that you'll trust
[95:52] me when i show you the video clip from
[95:54] my private mentorship group folks that
[95:56] are in my private mentorship group
[95:58] if i'm sharing something that was edited
[96:00] if i've changed that video in any way to
[96:03] make it seem or sound like something
[96:05] that really didn't take place on monday
[96:06] at the 13 minute mark of that video
[96:10] please say so in the comment section
[96:12] okay you're welcome to roast me okay i'm
[96:14] only telling you that because the
[96:16] comment section is open on my videos you
[96:18] guys can say whatever you want to say i
[96:20] don't care
[96:21] bottom line is i'm
[96:23] proven it okay i'm proving it that way
[96:25] you can feel comfortable learning from
[96:26] me there's no sales pitch here anymore
[96:29] just put down all your reservations and
[96:32] just grab a pen and pad and listen
[96:35] and i promise you what you're looking
[96:36] for it'll come the confusion you're
[96:38] getting about the opening prices at
[96:40] midnight and the opening prices at new
[96:42] york
[96:43] 8 30 a.m
[96:46] last ditch for power 3
[96:49] is 8 30. what does that mean if
[96:52] the opening price at midnight if you're
[96:54] bullish is lower than price is trading
[96:57] at
[96:58] around 8 30 or after 8 30
[97:01] then it's likely it's not going to be a
[97:03] factor
[97:04] then you use 8 30.
[97:07] if
[97:08] there is a day like this one here where
[97:10] we have the opening price at midnight
[97:12] here we're already below it and then at
[97:15] after 8 30 we're below it again still
[97:17] below the midnight candles opening price
[97:20] we're really in a discount
[97:22] like we're really really cheap
[97:24] on the day
[97:25] when we're bullish now think about what
[97:27] i've outlined so far
[97:30] it seems like a long way here
[97:32] but everything i've discussed is
[97:35] paramount and crucial for you to
[97:36] understand why this is occurring
[97:38] because these are the things that are
[97:40] going to repeat
[97:41] don't take my word for it
[97:43] start back testing and logging your
[97:45] charts like this and you will see these
[97:47] events
[97:48] repeating
[97:49] because it's algorithmic
[97:51] it will not do it every single day but
[97:54] every day
[97:56] it will be present in something that's
[97:58] why i say with my motto it's every week
[98:01] every day and it won't stop
[98:03] it does not mean every week every day
[98:06] and it won't stop every single
[98:08] individual market because you have to be
[98:10] able to navigate some days
[98:12] it may not happen in the futures
[98:15] it might be in forex or it might be in
[98:17] bonds
[98:19] so you have to be
[98:20] flexible in that regard okay but every
[98:22] single week there's this type of setup
[98:24] every single week there's a setup like
[98:27] this
[98:29] inside this range it moved from here to
[98:31] here and then started retracing down
[98:33] after midnight notice that so all of
[98:35] this here is a judah swing judo swing is
[98:38] the move that's
[98:40] opposite to what you expect the daily
[98:42] range to be
[98:43] so if we're bullish and we think it's
[98:45] going up here
[98:47] we like this movement going down we love
[98:50] it
[98:51] now you may not feel comfortable buying
[98:53] the london or overnight lows that's fine
[98:56] you don't need to wait for 8 30.
[99:00] if we drop below 8 30 opening price
[99:03] and here's the here's the kicker we're
[99:05] below the opening price at midnight two
[99:07] we are really really oversold
[99:10] does it take indicators to see that no
[99:14] did you
[99:15] require some kind of divergence nope how
[99:17] about a fibonacci nope
[99:20] easy isn't it
[99:22] visually see what's being shown here
[99:24] below the opening price you want to be a
[99:26] buyer at midnight by itself that's
[99:28] always the
[99:28] the basis of what i'm trying to do each
[99:31] day
[99:32] then
[99:33] if we get a 8 30 candle that opens below
[99:35] the midnight candle and then we have a
[99:37] movement below that
[99:39] that move here also is like a micro
[99:42] judas swing for the session of new york
[99:45] this is the judas swing on the daily
[99:47] range or the daily candle
[99:49] so this is
[99:50] basically building the low the daily
[99:51] candle this is building below the new
[99:53] york session
[99:55] both are using the power 3 concept which
[99:57] is accumulation manipulation
[99:59] distribution
[100:00] so what we're saying is this movement
[100:02] below the opening price at 8 30 and
[100:04] below the opening price at midnight each
[100:06] move lower is the trap
[100:09] it's the snare that catches traders
[100:12] thinking it's going down
[100:14] we are looking for that move we're
[100:17] looking for that drop down
[100:19] not just
[100:20] any indiscriminate drop in price we're
[100:22] looking for a very specific thing
[100:27] now i'm down into a five minute chart
[100:30] same things i had on the 15 minute time
[100:31] frame i now have just
[100:34] showing and representing it on a
[100:36] five-minute chart
[100:38] i want to take a look at price study
[100:40] think about what you see in price action
[100:42] here pause the video
[100:51] if you're not ready i'm about to begin
[100:55] right there
[100:57] see that fair value got right there
[101:00] see these two down close candles
[101:04] that that's your order block that's
[101:05] bullish
[101:06] your favorite value got
[101:08] and 8 30 we have a drop down
[101:10] at 8 30 we're looking to the left
[101:13] and see where are
[101:15] our short term swing lows because we
[101:17] want to absorb
[101:19] sell stops because smart money will pair
[101:21] that with their buys
[101:23] and we're looking for an imbalance
[101:25] preferably
[101:26] and we just happen to have it also with
[101:28] an order block so a lot of things
[101:30] happening here it comes down hits it
[101:33] and then rallies
[101:34] 8 30
[101:36] opening price we find it come back down
[101:38] into it find some support
[101:40] and it springs aggressively above
[101:43] the short-term highs
[101:45] by itself that right there's enough
[101:47] that's a that's a beautiful
[101:49] run on s p and that would be enough
[101:54] you don't need to have the objective up
[101:56] here
[101:57] but if you're holding it for the daily
[101:59] range you're going to wait for it to
[102:00] reach up in here and it does so here now
[102:03] in this area here knows what happens it
[102:04] rallies up and consolidates during lunch
[102:07] and around the two o'clock hour going to
[102:09] three o'clock we run back down into
[102:12] cell stops traders that have trailed
[102:15] their stop-loss up because they don't
[102:16] want to lose any of their profits
[102:19] and then they pump it one more time up
[102:20] into the pm session or afternoon move
[102:23] into the liquidity that was outlined
[102:25] relative equal highs on the 15-minute
[102:27] time frame
[102:30] here is the one-minute chart
[102:32] how can you apply what i've been
[102:33] teaching you on the youtube model well
[102:36] here it is
[102:38] here is the low
[102:40] forming
[102:41] and now find the setup
[102:44] that would occur with the youtube model
[102:47] so we're seeing a movement here
[102:49] the bias is bullish we're looking for
[102:51] continuation on the upside
[102:53] we have a target based on that 15 minute
[102:55] time frame relative equal highs
[102:57] what does the model i'm teaching on
[102:59] youtube
[103:00] where does that exist here
[103:04] again pause the video
[103:06] use this moment to really look for it
[103:08] yourself if you just wait for me to show
[103:10] it to you you waste the opportunity on
[103:12] learning
[103:18] all right
[103:19] don't be upset if you don't get it it's
[103:21] okay but
[103:22] i'm going to show you now what you
[103:24] should be seeing
[103:27] okay the market has a run above
[103:30] is short-term high so we have a shift in
[103:33] market structure that's bullish
[103:35] what's this a fair value gap i trade
[103:37] down into it hammers it
[103:40] three consecutive down close candles
[103:41] that's what your order block
[103:43] all consecutive
[103:45] because we're looking at one minute
[103:46] candles
[103:48] that is the order block with a fair
[103:49] value got
[103:50] buy it there and then comes back down
[103:53] retests
[103:54] sends it higher and then one more time
[103:57] new york midnight candle opening price
[104:00] opportunity again it trades up into the
[104:02] new york midnight opening candle trades
[104:04] back into
[104:06] another gap
[104:08] trades into the midpoint of that rallies
[104:10] up
[104:10] consolidates and then expands up into
[104:13] our objective that was outlined in that
[104:14] 15 minute time frame the relative equal
[104:16] highs
[104:20] let's dig a little bit deeper
[104:23] notice the price low here
[104:26] it's around uh what is that
[104:28] 43
[104:30] 70 something 476 or something like that
[104:33] just for the sake of
[104:35] clarity we'll just say 43.77 okay
[104:39] 43.77 is around here
[104:42] on this day now what i've shown is the
[104:44] daily chart but on an open
[104:47] high low close bar
[104:50] not a candlestick
[104:51] because i want you to graphically see
[104:52] what's occurring here now this opening
[104:54] price is not the midnight candle opening
[104:56] price because you can see it's about
[104:57] what is it 4404
[105:02] and a half or something like that
[105:04] that would be
[105:08] just above where this opening price is
[105:10] so
[105:10] my opening price is just a little bit
[105:12] above this opening price
[105:14] so i'm not using the opening price on
[105:15] the daily chart on trading view
[105:18] you can there's nothing really
[105:20] inherently wrong about that but i don't
[105:22] personally do that so that way for
[105:24] clarity and continuity i don't use the
[105:26] opening price on the daily candle i
[105:29] physically go into my chart and use the
[105:31] opening price at midnight once that
[105:32] candle begins trading
[105:34] at midnight that's your
[105:36] opening candle
[105:37] price for midnight
[105:40] and same thing for 8 30. as soon as 8 30
[105:43] starts
[105:44] that opening price on the candle that's
[105:46] my opening press 8 30. so i have to wait
[105:48] till 8 30 scandal or 8 30 exactly the
[105:51] time right when that happens that's my
[105:54] opening price
[105:56] i'm not referring to any opening or
[105:58] closing price on the candle
[106:00] okay
[106:01] what i'm forecasting with my analysis
[106:04] concepts and teaching my students is i'm
[106:06] teaching them to anticipate these types
[106:08] of moves
[106:10] so
[106:11] the relative equal highs on that 50
[106:12] minute time frame is basically this
[106:15] candle's high
[106:17] go back and look at your charts and
[106:18] you'll see that's exactly what that is
[106:20] so this short term run below this short
[106:22] term low
[106:24] is taking all the sale stops on that day
[106:26] on the 18th
[106:28] the 18th
[106:29] that evening i was telling my students
[106:31] that that is when i anticipate that the
[106:34] s p should go higher and run for those
[106:36] relatively equal highs on the 15-minute
[106:37] time frame because we've already went
[106:40] down into a deep discount daily chart
[106:42] and it's likely to come back up and grab
[106:44] that liquidity even if it's just going
[106:46] to keep going lower that's still okay it
[106:48] doesn't change anything even if it goes
[106:50] higher from here and i'm wrong it's
[106:52] reversed and makes a longer term rally
[106:54] higher i don't care
[106:55] we're looking for surgical strikes
[106:57] intraday for these markets these index
[106:59] futures
[107:01] but there has to be some kind of logic
[107:03] so if we look at what we've done over
[107:05] here
[107:06] and how this fits the daily candle
[107:10] what i'm suggesting is
[107:12] my opening price because at midnight
[107:13] we're a little bit higher
[107:15] and i don't need to catch that very very
[107:17] short-term low that's lower than this
[107:19] one okay because that low is
[107:24] right here and we're actually a little
[107:25] bit lower than that
[107:26] to the left
[107:28] i don't need that
[107:30] this is the reference point at which my
[107:32] methods would see as an entry point
[107:35] so that's real close
[107:38] that's like right in here that's real
[107:40] close to the low of the day
[107:42] i don't need to have the load of day you
[107:44] don't need to have the low of the day
[107:46] but when you get to the new york
[107:49] session opening at equities 9 30 in the
[107:51] morning new york time
[107:53] this run in here
[107:55] that sets it up another opportunity here
[107:57] so we have optimal trade entry here if
[107:58] you want to trade the ote pattern teach
[108:00] on the youtube channel
[108:02] then it rallies up
[108:04] and then you're running all the way up
[108:06] the daily range
[108:07] until we get to this candle's high here
[108:09] which is the relative equal highs on the
[108:11] 15-minute time frame go back into your
[108:14] charts and you'll see that okay this is
[108:16] what back testing does it gives you the
[108:18] logic so what's occurring here is what
[108:20] it's purging cell stops and reverting
[108:23] back to the high in the last three days
[108:25] boom
[108:27] now
[108:28] for some of you that need to hear me
[108:31] and what i said in the video clip in my
[108:33] private group i'll play that for you now
[108:37] 50 minute time frame ump futures june
[108:40] contract 2022
[108:42] again just
[108:44] brutal back and forth just
[108:46] consolidations
[108:47] and
[108:49] there isn't really a whole lot in here
[108:51] that i like that it may want to reach
[108:53] for except for just the old relative
[108:56] equal highs to me it looks too perfect
[108:58] it looks too pristine
[109:00] too classic support resistance idea okay
[109:03] so
[109:06] you know a lot of people want to sell
[109:07] short they want to get short they want
[109:08] to be bearish on this thing and notice
[109:10] what's happening with all that you know
[109:12] we're going to run higher it brought it
[109:14] breaks lower then they send it one more
[109:16] time higher clean up that drop it once
[109:19] more lower and now
[109:22] to me it looks like they're just gonna
[109:24] send this thing vertical
[109:26] to clean that up if it doesn't do that
[109:29] and it starts to trade lower
[109:31] i'm not chasing it i'm not trying to
[109:33] follow suit with that i just want to
[109:36] give it more time to find out what it
[109:37] wants to do because to me right now
[109:39] we're so deep in discount on the daily
[109:41] chart it can come up to this level here
[109:43] and really not upset anything if it's
[109:45] going to continue going lower that's my
[109:46] point in saying that
[109:48] all right so hopefully
[109:50] i've covered a lot of stuff tonight i
[109:52] talked about a lot of things that
[109:54] students have asked me to
[109:56] touch on in my private group and i've
[110:00] obviously seen some of the comments
[110:02] referring to the opening price what is
[110:03] the opening price what is it why should
[110:05] i use it and how do i differentiate the
[110:07] importance between the opening at
[110:09] midnight new york and that of the 8 30
[110:11] candle in new york session
[110:14] so hopefully it's been a little bit more
[110:16] clear for you but the main thing is
[110:18] you're looking for
[110:20] an opportunity to anticipate the
[110:22] expansion of that daily candle in one
[110:25] direction or the other either higher or
[110:27] lower
[110:28] and in that direction higher or lower
[110:30] where is it likely to go and the easiest
[110:32] thing i teach is old highs and all lows
[110:35] and relative equal highs and relative
[110:36] equal lows those two ways of looking for
[110:39] pools of liquidity are the easiest most
[110:41] visual representations of targeting
[110:45] there is
[110:46] it's simple
[110:48] because it's based on
[110:50] sound logic that the algorithm will
[110:51] never be changed
[110:53] because of
[110:54] because old highs right above that's
[110:56] always going to be by side liquidity buy
[110:58] stops are going to rest above that
[110:59] and below old lows there are cell stops
[111:01] resting below that it's always going to
[111:03] be that way folks it always will be that
[111:05] way
[111:06] don't send me comments in the videos
[111:08] please don't send me emails asking me
[111:11] that question do i think by me teaching
[111:13] is it going to break it are they going
[111:14] to change their route they're not
[111:16] changing anything they can't change it
[111:17] because that's the way these markets
[111:19] book that's the way it is folks it's the
[111:22] way it is
[111:23] the sky is blue
[111:25] not all the time
[111:27] but the sky is blue
[111:29] the grass is green not all the time
[111:32] but the grass is green
[111:34] you follow what i'm saying
[111:36] so these are rules we live by
[111:39] sometimes there's going to be these
[111:42] outliers these things that creep in that
[111:45] cause your interpretation of price to be
[111:48] incorrect
[111:49] and guess what that means
[111:51] you did something wrong
[111:53] does that mean that you're a failed
[111:54] trader no it just means you made a
[111:56] mistake that you're human i'm human i'm
[111:58] gonna make mistakes i'm gonna read it
[111:59] wrong i'm gonna interpret it wrong i'm
[112:02] going to react too late i'm going to
[112:04] react too soon
[112:05] i'm going to anticipate things that are
[112:08] not likely to occur and then either i
[112:10] have to take the loss or i reverse
[112:13] these are all things that you're going
[112:14] to have to be met with in time
[112:17] and you're going to have to see whether
[112:18] or not
[112:19] this is for you
[112:21] and some of you
[112:22] in all honesty
[112:24] this isn't going to be for you not my
[112:27] stuff alone but trading in general
[112:29] because it's risky
[112:30] and don't ever think
[112:32] that
[112:34] something magical is going to happen if
[112:35] you're not consistently profitable in a
[112:37] demo account and you're not consistently
[112:40] finding setups executing them
[112:43] getting in and getting out with
[112:44] confidence
[112:47] on the lowest
[112:48] of leverage
[112:49] see that's what i don't like about i
[112:51] know some of you
[112:53] are you
[112:55] i'm i don't know how you guys link like
[112:58] when you i don't know how you guys link
[113:00] in the comments
[113:01] people link me
[113:03] but
[113:04] every time i try to link someone either
[113:06] i'm putting their name in wrong
[113:08] it never links it so i never do that but
[113:11] they'll make videos
[113:13] and i see it as a mention in youtube
[113:15] sometimes it's a day or two late so it's
[113:17] not like i'm ignoring you but for
[113:19] whatever reason i get these
[113:20] notifications that are days late
[113:24] and i see folks that are doing videos
[113:26] and are recording themselves actually
[113:27] entering in the trades on the paper
[113:29] trading application trading view which
[113:31] is great but they're using leverage that
[113:34] everybody knows that they are not
[113:36] really in a position to afford
[113:38] so i know it feels cool it feels flashy
[113:42] and you know
[113:43] it might feel like you're playing a
[113:45] video game
[113:46] i don't want you to have that mindset i
[113:49] want you to think about how you can make
[113:50] this as boring
[113:52] as possible because if you make it
[113:54] boring
[113:56] you won't be a victim of your emotions
[113:59] it'll be just like you go to work i'm
[114:01] not saying you love going to your job
[114:03] but you know doing those things that you
[114:05] go to work to do
[114:07] yields you what that paycheck at the end
[114:09] of the week
[114:10] that's your minimum expectation get to
[114:12] work and do what's expected of you
[114:14] anything above that then obviously it's
[114:16] up to your manager to decide whether or
[114:17] not it's warranted
[114:19] to receive anything more than your
[114:20] standard pay
[114:23] but you need to treat this just like
[114:24] that it's a business
[114:26] so
[114:28] when you're doing your executions don't
[114:30] be influenced by trolls or hecklers in
[114:33] the comments section
[114:35] saying oh well you know you you're doing
[114:38] micro lots
[114:39] one micro lot it's not about that size
[114:42] of leverage it's about you finding the
[114:44] consistency of getting in
[114:47] knowing what you're looking for in terms
[114:48] of managing the risk in terms of the
[114:50] points or pips
[114:51] not the money
[114:53] not
[114:55] the money the money is a derivative of
[114:57] doing the right things
[114:59] in the beginning you need to focus on
[115:02] doing the right things the logic needs
[115:04] to be there not the reaction emotionally
[115:07] and psychologically to
[115:09] fake demo money
[115:11] don't do that
[115:12] you're actually
[115:13] causing yourself
[115:17] barriers it really is creating a barrier
[115:20] for you to find success
[115:22] if you do those things
[115:24] it feels cool it feels fun like yeah if
[115:26] i would have been a real trade i could
[115:27] have made this much money
[115:29] but you didn't
[115:31] so let that be the reality you didn't
[115:34] so you're really tricking and
[115:36] conditioning yourself improperly
[115:39] which is the opposite of what i teach my
[115:41] students with back testing
[115:43] whereas i teach my students when they do
[115:45] their back testing in their annotations
[115:46] they write in there
[115:48] as if they saw the trade happening
[115:51] beforehand
[115:52] and by doing that it's like self-talk
[115:55] you're speaking to your subconscious and
[115:57] your subconscious is going to refer back
[115:59] to that
[116:00] as a false memory
[116:02] because it's a positive reinforcement it
[116:05] teaches you because of pattern
[116:06] recognition and
[116:07] over and over again being exposed to the
[116:10] same elements and you're
[116:12] reinforcing yourself with your own
[116:13] comments and your own cheerleading
[116:16] you're fortifying
[116:18] your expectations going forward on
[116:21] this pattern yielding something in the
[116:23] past not that it's going to absolutely
[116:25] work in the future all the time but
[116:28] we as
[116:30] price action traders we look for
[116:31] signatures that repeat
[116:34] nothing is guaranteed that's going to
[116:35] repeat that's why we have to have stop
[116:37] loss that way
[116:38] we know that there's risk in this market
[116:40] every market in trading has risk
[116:43] but if you're going to hone an edge or a
[116:45] model
[116:46] you need to have a framework and you
[116:48] start by back testing and at back
[116:50] testing in your annotations you talk
[116:52] about how it feels good to see this move
[116:55] deliver as i was expecting from this
[116:57] fair value gap up to this bicep
[116:58] liquidity pool during the hours of this
[117:01] and this and this is what my model
[117:03] suggests i should be looking for each
[117:04] day
[117:06] notice i didn't say
[117:08] i was stupid i was playing video games
[117:10] and i was watching some youtuber talking
[117:12] about some nonsense and i missed the
[117:14] trade setup i should have known better
[117:16] never do that kind of stuff not in your
[117:18] back testing not in anything that you're
[117:19] recording in your journal
[117:21] everything has to be positive you're
[117:23] sugar coating everything
[117:25] in your back testing
[117:27] you're tricking your brain
[117:29] to see that as experience
[117:32] so that way when you see it forming live
[117:34] you're not going to be
[117:36] in fear and trepidation of oh it's going
[117:38] to be a painful experience and again
[117:41] when right now
[117:43] you don't have the experience yet but
[117:44] because you keep logging it with back
[117:46] testing
[117:48] you're filling your brain up with a lot
[117:49] of pseudo memories
[117:52] so
[117:53] you're doing the
[117:55] the ideal
[117:57] utilization of a lie
[118:00] this is called what it is you're lying
[118:02] to yourself
[118:04] and children love this
[118:06] you're lying to yourself with positive
[118:08] reinforcement
[118:09] okay so that way when you look at
[118:11] something forming in real time it will
[118:13] be remembered and you won't have any
[118:16] negative triggering
[118:18] because of
[118:19] toxic annotations or toxic thinking
[118:22] you'll have memories of oh yeah i
[118:24] remember seeing that in your
[118:24] subconscious you may not see it or
[118:26] understand it or feel it when you're
[118:28] doing it but your subconscious reverts
[118:30] back to those experiences that you've
[118:32] logged with positive reinforcement
[118:35] don't take a demo account
[118:38] and do that same thing with
[118:41] i'm going to over leverage my demo
[118:43] account or paper trading account and do
[118:45] a size of leveraging that there's no way
[118:48] i would be able to number one put the
[118:49] trade on because i would be too scared
[118:51] because i'm a new trader and i'm going
[118:53] to be afraid of any fluctuation if i put
[118:56] on a million dollars worth of leverage i
[118:58] can't really sit through the
[119:01] spread opening up on me when i put the
[119:03] trade on initially let alone weather the
[119:05] ups and downs and initially you know as
[119:07] the trade pans out
[119:10] you're teaching yourself
[119:12] to anticipate a hopeful outcome with
[119:15] ridiculous leverage
[119:17] and you're teaching yourself
[119:19] that that negative drawdown that you're
[119:21] experiencing
[119:23] is not something to be worried about
[119:25] because
[119:26] you're only looking for the
[119:28] dopamine hit if you did it right and
[119:30] that video game high score
[119:33] means absolutely nothing in your growth
[119:36] you've created a speed bump and
[119:39] sometimes a barrier to being
[119:40] consistently profitable
[119:43] think
[119:45] when you do those things
[119:48] what you're saying is
[119:50] i'm putting blinders on
[119:53] i don't really see the real risk here
[119:56] because it's paper money and i want to
[119:58] show on my video a really high
[120:00] profitability
[120:02] in the end result
[120:03] because you want clout
[120:06] every single time
[120:09] every single time
[120:11] i see one of my students whether from
[120:13] the youtube community or some of my
[120:14] mentorship students that are in private
[120:16] group that have youtube channels
[120:19] they'll make a video and they'll use
[120:21] really high leverage
[120:22] but they may have executed extremely
[120:24] well manage the whole thing from
[120:27] beginning to end
[120:29] my comment consistently is
[120:31] next time
[120:33] even though i've commented and said
[120:34] you're well done on the other stuff i
[120:36] will always tell them
[120:38] next time use realistic leverage that's
[120:41] my only
[120:42] criticism
[120:43] not because
[120:45] of me trying to kick the legs out from
[120:47] underneath them i'm not trying to steal
[120:48] their steam or their drive or motivation
[120:52] i'm being
[120:53] the best influence i can because
[120:57] i don't want them
[120:59] filling their head up with things that
[121:00] are toxic because that's that's what
[121:02] that is
[121:03] it's all about clout and you don't want
[121:04] clout
[121:06] you want consistently profitable
[121:08] trust me being consistently profitable
[121:10] feels a whole lot better than clout on
[121:13] the internet
[121:14] i don't need everybody to love me and
[121:16] look at me i've been here for a long
[121:17] time and there's a lot of people that
[121:18] hate me for no justified reason but the
[121:20] point is none of that stuff causes me to
[121:22] lose any sleep
[121:23] so don't invite those environments where
[121:26] other people can influence your
[121:29] performance
[121:30] your expectations on yourself your model
[121:33] your trading
[121:35] none of these jokers on the internet
[121:37] should have any influence on you none
[121:40] they don't have it on me
[121:43] why
[121:44] because i have
[121:46] rooted
[121:47] deep rooted sound logic in the things
[121:50] that i'm looking for
[121:52] you all are experiencing that you're
[121:54] seeing it firsthand you're seeing it
[121:57] and it's encouraging so don't make the
[121:59] mistakes of adding these little things
[122:02] these flavor enhancers to your
[122:04] experience
[122:05] okay and calling them something that
[122:07] they're not because they're not going to
[122:08] make you better
[122:10] they're going to actually hurt you
[122:12] by over leveraging just because you want
[122:14] to see big numbers show up on your when
[122:16] your trade
[122:17] everybody watching knows that you put a
[122:18] demo trade on everybody knows you put
[122:20] paper trade on
[122:22] they know
[122:23] so
[122:24] don't
[122:26] you know
[122:27] parade around with it like it's a big
[122:29] deal it's not
[122:31] so the way you make it
[122:33] more respectful
[122:35] to your viewers and also
[122:37] remove the element of clout chasing
[122:42] use the smallest leverage
[122:44] let people that want to heckle let them
[122:46] heckle
[122:48] you worry about being consistent if you
[122:50] want to showcase your skill set
[122:52] do the executions and use the lowest
[122:55] leverage possible
[122:57] and let that be the example that you're
[122:59] showcasing
[123:01] so i think i've gone through the whole
[123:03] laundry list of things that i'm supposed
[123:04] to cover tonight in this and i know it's
[123:06] a very very long video i know it's
[123:08] probably long-winded for
[123:09] some of you to like to see me get right
[123:11] to the point but
[123:12] this whole thing was the point and it
[123:15] really is a clinic
[123:17] on how to operate and engage
[123:19] the marketplace using what i'm teaching
[123:21] even with what i'm teaching in the
[123:24] youtube model
[123:26] and i'm just so
[123:28] thankful
[123:29] that the community has really
[123:32] received it well
[123:34] um the comment section is just the love
[123:36] fest and i absolutely love it
[123:38] please don't call me the goat i won't
[123:40] ever heart your comment if you do that
[123:42] it's not i'm
[123:43] ignoring you i just never do that um
[123:45] don't call me a king i don't i don't
[123:47] like those things either

[124:03] experience for all of us and i'm finding
[124:05] a great deal of pleasure doing it which

[124:14] like
