[00:07] all right folks welcome back it's going
[00:08] to be a short little
[00:10] commentary on basically what i went with
[00:13] today
[00:14] giving commentary through twitter
[00:16] you're welcome to go over my twitter
[00:18] feed and go through it it's a lot
[00:19] because i was going all day long with it
[00:22] and
[00:23] i was kind of walking people through
[00:24] their own charts to kind of get a better
[00:27] feel for what to expect and where the
[00:29] real setup was going to be for today
[00:32] before i get into all that just know
[00:34] that everything that i said is time and
[00:36] date stamped so that way there's no time
[00:38] for worry about it and
[00:41] only the diligent are going to want to
[00:42] go through something like this and i put
[00:44] the
[00:46] readers on twitter
[00:48] through the meat grinder today i
[00:50] literally took them through
[00:52] every minor fluctuation
[00:54] explain why it should do this and should
[00:56] do that and ultimately setting up way
[00:59] before it happened uh the three o'clock
[01:01] to four o'clock short i outlined it in
[01:04] detail gave the reasons why it should
[01:06] take place
[01:07] everything's there and everything i'm
[01:09] gonna say in
[01:10] short highlight here
[01:13] is obviously found in the tweets
[01:16] so
[01:17] we have an outside day here yesterday
[01:19] big down closed day
[01:21] an outside day is a day that's higher
[01:23] than the previous day and lowered in the
[01:24] previous day's low
[01:26] so here's previous day's high
[01:28] it went higher his previous stays low it
[01:31] went lower so all of this range is
[01:33] outside of the previous day's range
[01:35] and it closed down
[01:37] when this happens there's
[01:39] typically this type of price action
[01:40] formation but it's really included
[01:43] with the
[01:44] odds in your favor
[01:46] if you're trading down to an old low but
[01:48] fall short of it okay this is usually
[01:50] where that double bottom idea comes in
[01:53] and it feels safe
[01:56] to
[01:57] if you're trading like me
[01:59] look for a run through that old low
[02:01] but if they stop it short
[02:04] it tends to be
[02:05] a choppy day
[02:07] especially if we have an outside date
[02:08] with down close
[02:10] so let's go into an hourly chart
[02:17] all right so here's the price action for
[02:20] today we're going to look inside this
[02:21] little tiny little fractal right here
[02:24] and
[02:25] i can zoom in here
[02:30] all right
[02:33] so we have
[02:35] old highs in here if you look at the
[02:37] high here it comes in at
[02:39] 39 33 and a quarter i mentioned that
[02:42] level today mentioned it a few times
[02:44] that we were going to trade up to that
[02:46] and
[02:47] i built the idea that
[02:49] looking at price studying in the way
[02:51] that i teach it
[02:52] it would be very easy to fall victim
[02:54] in this type of trading day whereas
[02:56] choppy it's listless trading back and
[02:59] forth
[03:00] and how to anticipate it what to look
[03:02] for and i want to go into the
[03:05] five-minute chart real quick
[03:09] okay and here's a five-minute chart
[03:12] and i want to add some annotations here
[03:15] so here is the
[03:17] 33 and a quarter level that's why that
[03:19] level was mentioned in the tweets
[03:21] this is the low at 38 72 and a quarter
[03:24] and the old low on the daily chart that
[03:27] did not get traded through is at
[03:29] 38.55 and notice we just fell short of
[03:32] reaching that
[03:34] at 38.56
[03:36] so we went one handle short of that
[03:39] started trading higher
[03:41] and i mentioned how
[03:43] the market
[03:45] many times can present opportunities
[03:47] that look like it's likely to form
[03:50] a setup but it really doesn't really
[03:52] come to fruition and if you look at the
[03:55] range
[03:56] here
[04:13] okay i'm highlighting
[04:14] [Music]
[04:17] this theory that you got right there
[04:19] okay how we treated up into it
[04:21] started working lower created a small
[04:23] little fair value gap in here
[04:26] bumped into that traded lower nothing
[04:28] really in here
[04:30] to work with in terms of the model so
[04:32] nothing here is a short we were talking
[04:33] about all that this morning
[04:35] so
[04:37] as the market was trading around in this
[04:40] area i mentioned how it was likely to be
[04:42] a 50 50
[04:44] probability that means
[04:46] it's likely to go higher
[04:47] just as well as it is likely to trade
[04:50] lower okay so what's the benefit in that
[04:52] obviously anybody can come into it with
[04:54] a 50 50 expectation but it really
[04:56] statistically moves to 50 50 when we
[04:58] start trading back into the middle of
[04:59] the range okay so
[05:02] this imbalance here the fair value gap
[05:04] it should have offered a little bit more
[05:06] movement lower why wouldn't it go down
[05:07] and take out this short term low it went
[05:10] below this short-term low here and then
[05:12] started rallying working towards the
[05:14] relative equal highs over here
[05:16] i mentioned early on that it would go to
[05:18] 39 33 and a quarter that's where it
[05:21] would go
[05:22] but i favored in other words in terms of
[05:25] bias for the longer term i favored
[05:28] the 3855 level down here for sell side i
[05:32] don't think that they're done with it
[05:34] down there
[05:35] but we have to take every single trade
[05:37] idea based on its current dealing ranges
[05:40] and what's a dealing range well dealing
[05:42] range would be like from this high down
[05:43] to that low and we measure those
[05:47] yes it trades up into that imbalance and
[05:49] trades down to a short term low that's a
[05:50] tradable opportunity there
[05:52] but it's not
[05:55] very clear
[05:56] after that it just goes back and forth
[05:58] chopping
[05:59] short-term lows are taken high high is
[06:02] taken here we trade back and forth all
[06:04] of this is really ugly type of price
[06:06] action
[06:08] and i mentioned that we would go to you
[06:10] know 39 33 and a quarter back here and
[06:12] it ran right up into it cleared those
[06:13] relative equal highs
[06:15] broke down traded back down into the
[06:17] range and i started talking about how
[06:20] the real
[06:21] setup that would be formed
[06:23] by my content by the things that make
[06:25] sense in the algorithm would deliver a
[06:27] specific
[06:28] framework today
[06:30] i told everybody on twitter you can go
[06:31] back and look at it to take a vertical
[06:33] line and add it to
[06:37] three o'clock
[06:39] new york local time
[06:44] and
[06:45] four o'clock
[06:47] and that would be the setup
[06:49] that forms
[06:53] to take us back down into
[06:54] [Music]
[06:57] the middle of the range now i
[06:59] tell everyone the tweets to study
[07:02] the middle of the daily range okay so
[07:05] what does that mean if you look at what
[07:07] the high was
[07:09] and the low
[07:13] okay right in here if that's the middle
[07:15] of the range
[07:16] we ran above the short-term high so we
[07:19] have relative equal highs here and
[07:20] relative equal highs here so there's
[07:21] buy-side resting here i outlined how the
[07:23] market would use
[07:25] the
[07:26] running up
[07:27] to take out the buy stops to squeeze
[07:29] anybody that was short and trail their
[07:31] stop-loss down
[07:32] and also to induce people into thinking
[07:35] it's going to go higher so that way it
[07:37] builds up liquidity below these lows
[07:38] what kind of liquidity sell side
[07:40] liquidity because they're going to
[07:41] protect their what long positions but
[07:44] the main thing was focusing on the
[07:45] middle middle of the range here
[07:47] so if we're looking for
[07:49] setups that are going to be based on a
[07:51] run above for buy side and pull back
[07:53] into the range
[07:55] it needs to be specific in terms of time
[07:57] i gave a very specific window between
[07:58] three o'clock and four o'clock in the
[08:00] afternoon
[08:01] so we go into an out uh i'm sorry i'm an
[08:03] hour we're gonna go into a minute chart
[08:08] okay and
[08:10] you can see here
[08:11] the market rallies above
[08:14] bumps into the buy side liquidity
[08:17] smart money uses that
[08:19] to go short this is exactly what i
[08:21] outlined beforehand it's all in the
[08:23] tweets it's not ambiguous it's very
[08:25] specific i tell you exactly when the
[08:26] trade is going to form i tell you
[08:28] exactly how it's going to happen i'll
[08:29] tell you the framework the logic the
[08:30] narrative everything it's going to pull
[08:33] back to the middle of the range
[08:35] here is the breakdown
[08:37] here let me take
[08:38] this is this a swing low
[08:41] yes is this a fair bag gap
[08:44] yes does it trade back up into
[08:46] that range yes
[08:48] it works lower
[08:51] back into the middle of the range
[08:53] let me put this back where i want
[08:55] okay and if i add
[08:58] the annotations
[09:03] you can see right there
[09:07] i sold short at 39.40 and three quarters
[09:10] and i took
[09:12] four of them off at 3908
[09:14] and three quarters middle of the range
[09:17] and
[09:24] you can see
[09:26] there still is
[09:28] a position
[09:29] there with partials taken off already
[09:36] and
[09:37] the limit order down here at 38.55 it
[09:40] doesn't matter if it goes down there now
[09:41] i don't care but i have a position in
[09:43] play should it do so
[09:45] and
[09:47] i want everyone to understand that there
[09:48] are people out there obviously who want
[09:51] to say stupid things because they either
[09:53] want to get a rise out of me or they're
[09:55] they feel that their competition and
[09:57] they want to get in a you know
[09:59] a lot more attention for themselves
[10:01] honestly you know
[10:03] if you want to build the tension around
[10:05] yourself just do things that weren't
[10:07] people's attention placed on you
[10:10] but for anyone that obviously did not
[10:12] spend time with me today
[10:15] this is going to be rather boring it's
[10:17] going to be pointless to you but i
[10:19] walked through all of the things that
[10:21] days like this
[10:23] where it's choppy
[10:25] okay where it's just going back and
[10:27] forth back and forth
[10:29] this was not read wrong i purposely took
[10:31] everybody in to the marketplace through
[10:33] their own chart and told them to think
[10:34] about what was going on in their own
[10:36] mind what other traders would be
[10:38] thinking so that way you could
[10:40] really capture what it feels like to be
[10:43] in there looking for your own setups and
[10:45] try to think critically about it
[10:48] i outline in advance where the setup
[10:49] based on the things i teach up here
[10:51] where it runs the buy stops we pair with
[10:53] that and then pull back to the middle
[10:55] range and it does so beautifully
[10:58] all of this in here is really hard
[11:01] choppy price action it's very very
[11:03] difficult to trade in those types of
[11:05] ranges because
[11:06] they can come back on you stop you out
[11:08] and just go nowhere for a long period of
[11:10] time so
[11:11] if you know what you're looking for in
[11:13] terms of what the algorithm is going to
[11:15] do and the algorithm on days like this
[11:17] this is called a consolidation day
[11:20] and what happens is this
[11:22] the market starts trading
[11:24] creates an initial range and then stays
[11:26] in that range until
[11:28] the afternoon at three o'clock
[11:32] it used to be the bond close that
[11:34] started this whole thing but now it's
[11:36] just three o'clock at four o'clock when
[11:38] equities close the closing bell
[11:40] that
[11:41] sets the tone for
[11:43] on close orders
[11:45] so what that means is what was going on
[11:48] prior to three o'clock the market was
[11:50] rallying up what did it go up for the
[11:52] buy side liquidity
[11:53] but traders gonna look at that as a
[11:55] breakout to go higher
[11:56] and they're going to pair that with the
[11:58] market
[11:59] participants that are considered smart
[12:01] money
[12:02] so that's exactly what i outlined this
[12:04] is exactly what transpired everybody in
[12:06] the
[12:08] twitter feed we're following along i
[12:10] mean granted there were a few people and
[12:12] you can go through and see who they were
[12:14] they weren't really paying attention
[12:15] because they came into the conversation
[12:17] late and i went a long day today just
[12:19] tweeting between tweeting uh what you
[12:21] don't know is i had my son sitting
[12:25] next to me and i'm outlining things to
[12:28] him and i'm explaining what she takes
[12:30] but
[12:31] should take place rather in the
[12:33] marketplace plus i'm also sending out
[12:35] tweets so
[12:37] my mind was divided between all of that
[12:39] so it was very difficult not only to
[12:41] predict what you all were thinking and
[12:43] thinking about what should be
[12:45] transpiring in price action plus
[12:48] literally walking through with my son
[12:49] what to anticipate expect and see in
[12:52] price action and through his lens uh he
[12:54] was actually executing in a live account
[12:57] uh he has his
[13:00] amp
[13:01] account linked right through trading
[13:02] view so you can trade directly right
[13:04] from the chart so
[13:06] he's plugging away on my laptop right
[13:08] next to me and
[13:10] his account
[13:11] was able to grow from six thousand
[13:13] dollars at the beginning of the week now
[13:15] it said ten thousand dollars
[13:18] that's real money that's live money and
[13:21] you know when i
[13:22] when i hear about people
[13:24] that
[13:25] say the stuff that i teach doesn't work
[13:27] or if i can't call the market and when
[13:29] people sit there and they spend the
[13:31] entire day with me and i outline
[13:34] everything and i outlined this very
[13:35] specific trade here way before it even
[13:38] forms before the market even went up
[13:40] there i'm explaining all that
[13:43] that it went right to where i said it
[13:44] was going to go
[13:45] run the stops
[13:46] then sync it back down the middle of
[13:48] range go back and look at the tweets i
[13:50] can't edit them
[13:52] and i'm not deleting anything okay so if
[13:54] i make a mistake a spelling error you're
[13:56] just gonna have to deal with it because
[13:57] you know i don't want any deleted tweets
[13:59] zero so if you'd like to follow me and
[14:02] all that stuff just save everything and
[14:04] save it all i don't care
[14:05] the point is i want you to save them as
[14:08] what exactly what i said the last time i
[14:09] was on twitter save my tweets
[14:12] save them because you're gonna see
[14:14] things
[14:15] that prove obviously what i'm talking
[14:17] about it proves that i have the
[14:19] visibility that i can see these things
[14:21] beforehand
[14:22] and there's a lot of people out there
[14:24] that will just
[14:26] not want to put the work into learning
[14:28] this because it seems too hard they just
[14:30] want to put an indicator on the chart
[14:32] and you know that's all i want give me a
[14:33] macd give me a stochastic moving average
[14:36] and we'll call it a day
[14:38] but
[14:39] they don't give you logic and narrative
[14:41] they just give you
[14:43] a crunching of the numbers
[14:45] and that type of thing isn't in my
[14:47] opinion not very beneficial because
[14:51] you're you're beating up the data of
[14:53] price action versus reading and
[14:55] understanding what the tape is and
[14:56] that's exactly what i was doing today
[14:58] with everybody on twitter
[14:59] so
[15:00] uh there is an application that i was
[15:03] made aware of on twitter that allows
[15:05] someone to do i think if i'm not
[15:06] mistaken they call them a space or
[15:08] spaces or if i said that wrong forgive
[15:10] me
[15:11] i'm not going to edit this video
[15:13] but apparently there's something on the
[15:15] twitter app that you can kind of like
[15:17] talk
[15:18] and i think it's just audio where you
[15:20] just talk and people that are
[15:22] i guess following you on twitter they
[15:24] can hear you talk so i guess i'm in a
[15:26] way it could be like an ict squawk box
[15:28] you know i can kind of like
[15:30] talk out loud
[15:31] about what i'm looking at what i think
[15:33] is useful
[15:35] it's not a trade setup obviously
[15:38] or a signal service type thing because
[15:41] that's not what i do i know i don't do
[15:42] those things so we were studying price
[15:44] action together over my shoulder through
[15:46] tweets
[15:47] and uh this was the move i was outlining
[15:50] well in advance early in the day i was
[15:51] setting the stage for all this back and
[15:53] forth motion
[15:55] that
[15:57] they're going to drive it higher to
[15:58] squeeze out traders that were already
[16:00] short from previous day
[16:02] and trailer stop loss right above
[16:05] the old high back
[16:06] here they bumped it here on a very
[16:09] shallow run let me take this off
[16:12] they bumped it on the
[16:14] let me take everything actually
[16:20] these relative equal highs as it dropped
[16:22] down they trailed their stop-loss those
[16:23] that are short
[16:24] so they ran out and bumped it on a
[16:26] shallow basis and then one more time
[16:28] they ram it up in there and clear them
[16:29] out real nice so
[16:33] the logic i was teaching was that would
[16:34] be utilized for smart money at the close
[16:37] between three o'clock and four o'clock
[16:38] so
[16:39] they ran it up there
[16:41] all the buy orders that were resting
[16:43] above here are here in the form of
[16:44] protecting short stops
[16:47] or not short stop short positions acting
[16:49] as their stop-loss order when the market
[16:51] trades above that those buy stops that
[16:54] are protective in nature
[16:56] they become a rushing liquidity wave
[17:00] okay of willing buyers at the market
[17:03] so willing buyers at the market
[17:05] at three o'clock on a day like this
[17:06] where it's consolidated
[17:08] it's going to want to go back to the
[17:09] middle of the range and that's why i
[17:11] posted until we did study the middle of
[17:12] range of today's range okay
[17:14] so
[17:15] when you
[17:16] look at that type of event it's going to
[17:19] range bound trade between
[17:21] here's the 9 30 or so right
[17:24] there okay so the low of the day there
[17:27] and the high the day there so split that
[17:29] in the middle there's your midpoint and
[17:31] it's going to want to gravitate back to
[17:33] that
[17:34] so
[17:35] when you look at
[17:37] price action days like this
[17:39] and if you're caught up in it you know
[17:41] what you're doing or you feel like it's
[17:42] just being chopped up
[17:44] wait until three o'clock because many
[17:46] times at three o'clock to four
[17:48] the algorithm will do something where it
[17:50] goes outside the bounds of the daily
[17:51] range like it did here
[17:53] okay it trades up into it and then
[17:56] rams it down and
[17:58] nobody's really allowed to make any
[17:59] money anyone that was long freaking out
[18:01] here gets raped across the coals anyone
[18:03] that's short gets knocked out with a
[18:04] stop loss and then a losing position
[18:08] and most of the time traders are too
[18:10] afraid to go in here going short where
[18:12] people that like myself i outlined today
[18:14] in the front of
[18:16] you know 20 000 people
[18:19] they all seen it they all watched me
[18:20] call it and
[18:22] there it is
[18:24] there's my
[18:25] phil there's the middle of the range
[18:28] partial and i got two in float
[18:30] and just for the sake of
[18:33] completeness i'm just going to take one
[18:34] of them off while i'm doing this
[18:36] recording
[18:37] so that way i don't have to worry about
[18:38] it at all you can go to my stop
[18:41] and or
[18:42] go to my limit and either one's fine by
[18:44] me i don't care okay
[18:46] so
[18:47] i'm going to try to do a
[18:49] little bit of tomorrow's session i'm not
[18:51] going to spend the entire day obviously
[18:53] because i have other things that take
[18:54] care of but i've scheduled in today
[18:57] because i had to work with my son and
[18:59] his
[19:00] analysis and learning all that stuff so
[19:02] i was very proud to see him pushing the
[19:04] button on his account
[19:06] he did very very well
[19:08] had
[19:09] one or two uh hairy moments where he
[19:12] wasn't thinking like i was hoping he'd
[19:14] be thinking
[19:15] and had a losing trade
[19:18] was able to recoup that
[19:20] and push this account to over ten
[19:22] thousand dollars so i'm very proud to uh
[19:25] see him engaging and doing his own thing
[19:28] and trying to figure out this stuff on
[19:29] his own
[19:30] so
[19:33] yeah i think
[19:35] we'll talk a little bit through that
[19:36] twitter application tomorrow
[19:38] i don't know how long ago but uh we'll
[19:41] see what we get from that
[19:43] and i think that's going to be it for
[19:44] this one
[19:46] until i'll talk to you next time be safe
