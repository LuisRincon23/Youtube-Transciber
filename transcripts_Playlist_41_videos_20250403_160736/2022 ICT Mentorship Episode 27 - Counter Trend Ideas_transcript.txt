[00:17] all right folks welcome back this is our
[00:19] 27th episode of the continuing series of
[00:22] the free
[00:24] 2022 ict mentorship on youtube
[00:27] all right so massdeck
[00:29] daily chart for june 2022
[00:33] and here we have
[00:35] friday's trading here okay
[00:38] friday thursday wednesday tuesday monday
[00:40] so we had a nice little
[00:41] decline down in this week and then
[00:43] friday we have somewhat of a retracement
[00:46] if you've been following my community
[00:48] posts on the youtube channel
[00:51] i mentioned this morning
[00:52] that the 12
[00:54] 553 level
[00:56] is too clean and you can kind of see it
[00:59] in here like look at the high on this
[01:01] candle it's twelve thousand five forty
[01:04] seven and then here this high is
[01:06] twelve thousand five hundred and fifty
[01:08] three
[01:09] so i'm using this as the higher one but
[01:12] these relative equal highs that's what
[01:13] i'm looking at
[01:15] so i'm i'm thinking that it could draw
[01:18] there now i was giving it the
[01:20] opportunity to do so today based on what
[01:22] i showed in these short little vignettes
[01:24] i've posted on my video section
[01:28] i was out about today so obviously i was
[01:30] sharing what i could on my phone i don't
[01:34] generally trade
[01:36] on the phone i can manage a position but
[01:39] i'm not generally trying to enter trades
[01:41] and such but
[01:43] i made a mistake today
[01:45] and i was trying to exit as i'll talk
[01:47] about in a moment when we get into lower
[01:49] timeframes but
[01:50] i was
[01:52] showing segments of me recording where
[01:54] the market was what it was doing when i
[01:55] was entering the whole business and
[01:56] you'll actually see the execution errors
[01:58] and all that business here tonight but
[02:00] uh the relative equal highs that was the
[02:03] draw on liquidity now the draw on
[02:05] liquidity does not need to be traded to
[02:07] to have a profitable
[02:10] framework or setup okay so what do i
[02:12] mean by that
[02:13] well if we're below this objective
[02:17] and i'm thinking and if which you
[02:19] thinking the same thing if you think
[02:20] that market's going to draw up to that
[02:22] level whether it be today or into next
[02:24] week
[02:25] you look for a setup that will allow you
[02:28] some kind of participation
[02:31] in this expansion towards that
[02:33] it doesn't need to get there as you'll
[02:36] soon see
[02:37] we're going to drop down into
[02:39] the hourly chart all right so here's the
[02:41] hourly chart you can see
[02:42] relative equal highs up in here look at
[02:45] the high on that candle there that's the
[02:46] 12 553 and a quarter level okay so
[02:49] that's what i'm framing it on
[02:52] and
[02:53] we traded down
[02:55] started to run higher
[02:57] we had a shift in market structure here
[02:59] and then just
[03:01] notice how we have had
[03:04] this low this low
[03:07] swept
[03:08] we came down below it
[03:10] came back above these relative equal
[03:12] lows
[03:13] and then we came back down tried one
[03:14] more time to go lower and then rejected
[03:16] it notice that so as the market's
[03:19] starting to trade higher
[03:20] where is it likely to go well we've
[03:22] already taken out a large pool of
[03:24] liquidity below these relatively equal
[03:26] lows
[03:27] this is sell side okay
[03:30] now we're back above these relative
[03:31] equal lows so where's buy side clear and
[03:34] obviously right here okay
[03:37] not really
[03:38] obvious in terms of any imbalance in
[03:40] here because we already rebalanced this
[03:42] area there
[03:43] so there's nothing really all that
[03:45] exciting except for that small little
[03:46] section there so if it's going to go up
[03:47] to this area here my thought process is
[03:50] that it's likely to probably just punch
[03:51] through and take the buy stops resting
[03:53] above here so that's the the draw on
[03:56] liquidity just think of it like a big
[03:58] magnet drawing price up towards it okay
[04:02] so
[04:03] we're going to drop down into a 15
[04:05] minute time frame
[04:10] [Music]
[04:14] all right so here's the 15 minute time
[04:15] frame and here's friday the 13th you
[04:18] scared
[04:20] are you scared so we have the market
[04:22] trade here lower low low so this right
[04:26] here may trip you up but this right here
[04:28] was a 9 30 in the morning manipulation
[04:30] where it takes up this overnight london
[04:32] low
[04:33] creates the manipulation idea then
[04:35] rallies i was not available during this
[04:38] time so i didn't take any trades as
[04:40] you'll see there's no trades in this
[04:41] area
[04:43] and then the retracement here in the
[04:44] afternoon that's what i was looking for
[04:46] so i wanted to see that type of
[04:48] idea
[04:49] so
[04:51] i'm going to add
[04:53] the annotations to the chart now all
[04:55] right so here's the five minute chart
[04:58] and here's the overnight
[05:00] london lows
[05:01] 9 30 we run through it
[05:04] taking out the sell side here and then
[05:06] it starts to rally
[05:08] all this rallying up here i was not able
[05:10] to participate in the market trades
[05:12] lower
[05:13] down into the range
[05:16] between this low
[05:17] and this high
[05:19] what is it trading to
[05:21] discount
[05:23] so
[05:23] i'm going to go into
[05:27] this area a little bit tighter
[05:32] okay so we can see
[05:33] here's our consolidation it drops down
[05:36] creates the low of the day
[05:39] power three so it's accumulating long
[05:41] positions
[05:42] manipulating
[05:44] early longs out of the market
[05:46] taking out the stops overnight
[05:49] then rallying
[05:51] and then
[05:52] i'm looking for the continuation up to
[05:54] take out the relative equal highs here
[05:55] because i think i'm still going to see
[05:57] continuation in the afternoon
[05:59] so i want to buy this discount market
[06:01] and i'm going to be buying inside of
[06:03] this
[06:04] value gap because it's
[06:06] at or below equilibrium between this low
[06:09] and the high all right so i've added the
[06:11] annotations here and i gotta adjust this
[06:12] because my obsessive compulsive disorder
[06:15] is flaring
[06:16] it's like a spider sense folks
[06:19] can't help it all right so we have
[06:22] the new york
[06:24] session open at 9 30 in the morning new
[06:25] york local time
[06:27] creates the low of the day rallies
[06:30] creates the high here at what time what
[06:32] time is this candle here it's 12 10
[06:35] that's that lunch time and i told you it
[06:37] creates usually a retracement of some
[06:38] sort or consolidation then it retraces
[06:41] lower and then here is 130 right about
[06:45] there so at 130
[06:47] the algorithm will start seeking
[06:49] liquidity if it's going to continue
[06:51] higher what's it likely to do
[06:53] seek sell sign so we're sell side well
[06:55] we have relative equal loads here but is
[06:58] that a discount from here to here
[07:01] no
[07:02] so this dashed line here that's in
[07:04] purple i have that noted as equilibrium
[07:07] that's essentially the same thing as
[07:09] it's taking the fib from here
[07:12] to here and that's 50
[07:14] okay so now we have equilibrium there
[07:16] the market drops down into equilibrium
[07:19] and then below it
[07:21] into
[07:22] the variable gap here
[07:24] this candle is high this candle is low
[07:26] that's your imbalance
[07:28] failure gap is here so the market drops
[07:30] down into it here at
[07:32] two o'clock in the afternoon
[07:36] 205
[07:38] 215
[07:40] 220
[07:41] 225
[07:42] and then displacement
[07:45] okay we'll see this fair value gap on
[07:48] the
[07:49] lower time frames i'm going to go
[07:50] through and let you see it but
[07:53] this
[07:54] displacement on the outside is a shift
[07:56] in market structure
[07:57] in a day that's likely to be bullish
[07:59] it's counter trend to a higher time
[08:00] frame
[08:02] we're working with the logic that it's
[08:05] probably going to be a retracement
[08:06] because we've been down for a long time
[08:09] now
[08:10] and most people are probably going to
[08:11] want to
[08:12] get out
[08:13] over the weekend so the algorithm is
[08:15] going to start squeezing on them to get
[08:18] their positions
[08:20] squared before the close of the friday
[08:23] so
[08:23] in this area here
[08:25] we're going to drop down into
[08:27] a four-minute chart
[08:31] okay
[08:31] no fair value got shown here except for
[08:33] this small little area there now by
[08:35] itself
[08:36] you know that's possible
[08:38] you get a small little return into it
[08:39] there
[08:40] i'm not looking at that okay
[08:42] go down into a
[08:44] three-minute chart
[08:47] okay
[08:49] there's a gap there again you can see
[08:51] that candle right there that would be
[08:52] fine if that's what you were looking for
[08:55] and then two minute chart
[08:58] there is
[09:03] gotta set my chart back
[09:06] it's got to be the way i want it folks
[09:09] all right so we have
[09:10] down closed candles in here order block
[09:14] fair value gap this candle is low
[09:17] this candle is high there's our
[09:18] imbalance
[09:20] the order block
[09:21] it trades down drops into that
[09:23] and i'm going to show you
[09:27] the executions
[09:30] here
[09:32] so as it's dropping down
[09:34] in here
[09:35] you can see i have
[09:37] hover top of this thing
[09:39] i bought 36 contracts
[09:42] and the assumption is we're using a
[09:44] discount broker something like amp
[09:47] futures i'm not repping amp futures by
[09:49] the way
[09:50] but they have really
[09:52] low margins so that would be allowed for
[09:55] something with the equity that was used
[09:57] in this example today these are paper
[09:59] trades so you guys know for compliance
[10:01] reasons and full disclosure
[10:03] i'm illustrating execution and theory
[10:05] okay
[10:06] i'm also showing you what i was doing
[10:09] when i was on twitter
[10:11] when i did use mt4 which i don't do
[10:13] anymore i haven't used mt4 in years okay
[10:16] i don't need to have a fake mt4 server
[10:18] to be able to do this okay
[10:20] this is what i was doing
[10:22] and i was trading it and building it up
[10:24] and building it up and building it up so
[10:26] in a matter of a week or so i've taken a
[10:29] hundred thousand dollar account took it
[10:30] over 300 000
[10:32] okay and you'll see that here in a
[10:33] second but
[10:35] as it was dropping down dropping down
[10:38] all this candle here i was buying at the
[10:40] beginning of the um fair value gap
[10:42] and about the middle of it and i was
[10:44] trying to get into the lower portions of
[10:47] it but it didn't quite get down there so
[10:49] the fairway gap in the shaded area
[10:51] that's what's being shown here
[10:53] take that off for clarity's sake and we
[10:56] drop in here
[10:57] i mentioned
[10:58] in the small little vignette again i've
[11:00] done
[11:01] three videos today
[11:03] that were basically silent i put a
[11:06] little bit of a music thing on it just
[11:07] to
[11:08] i don't know i was testing it out i was
[11:11] really disappointed didn't play the
[11:12] entire time the video was playing but
[11:13] whatever
[11:14] the idea was i was showing you that when
[11:16] we went into the order block that it was
[11:18] going to rally up
[11:19] okay and it rallied up and then i took
[11:21] off 10. i saw a small little vignette
[11:24] shows me closing 10 contracts
[11:26] there and i was looking for it to
[11:30] maybe stage a run up into
[11:34] that twelve five five three level that i
[11:37] mentioned on
[11:38] my community post
[11:40] okay but obviously we were running out
[11:42] of time today and i messed up on the
[11:46] close of the 20 contracts because i
[11:47] wanted to take off 20 above here and try
[11:50] to put it in as a limit order but it
[11:52] ended up closing his market so what i
[11:54] should have done was and i said this to
[11:55] my private group too
[11:57] i'm working with tradingview but i'm
[11:59] used to using actual live platforms so
[12:02] the things that i can do in other places
[12:04] i can't necessarily do here and because
[12:06] i'm doing it on my phone and i was out
[12:07] doing other things it real real life and
[12:10] this is the reason why you don't want to
[12:11] be trading off of your phone okay but
[12:13] anyway i ended up closing uh the 20 here
[12:17] so i didn't get it above that 12
[12:20] 430 level i was trying to aim for
[12:23] so i missed it there and then i closed
[12:27] more here
[12:30] and here
[12:32] and then finally in late in the day i
[12:34] had one left and i just took it off here
[12:37] okay
[12:38] so that's the business there and
[12:42] i want you to look at
[12:48] how the market created this counter
[12:50] trend idea but still using my fair value
[12:53] gap principle and concept
[12:56] liquidity was above here
[12:58] the day was bullish
[13:01] the algorithm kept pricing higher and
[13:02] higher and higher
[13:04] and the logic was delivered here
[13:07] so look at where the arrows are for
[13:10] entries
[13:16] and this was a failure on my part i
[13:18] didn't get the price i actually wanted
[13:20] none of these closures were actually
[13:22] above the 12
[13:24] 430 level that was i think the closest
[13:26] one
[13:28] yeah that was the closest one there
[13:30] so and i had one left over here and that
[13:32] was the final bit of business i was
[13:34] leaving it just in case some freaky
[13:36] occurrence where it would take us up in
[13:37] some parabolic run into
[13:39] twelve five five three but
[13:41] this wasn't in the cards today we're
[13:43] gonna steam
[13:45] you can frame what i'm teaching
[13:48] inside of a counter trend model if
[13:50] that's what you are by nature a
[13:52] contrarian
[13:54] if you want to be trading with the
[13:55] highest probability
[13:57] and in sync
[13:58] with the early session move
[14:01] then trade exactly how i've outlined the
[14:03] principles around that 8 30 to 9 30
[14:06] window okay
[14:10] i'm trying to do my best to give you a
[14:12] little bit of freedom
[14:14] to try to make it your own
[14:16] and inspire you also that these fair
[14:18] value gaps are useful if you know what
[14:21] the bias is okay and i know some of you
[14:23] are still posting in the comment section
[14:25] i'm still struggling with vice it's only
[14:27] because you haven't worked at it long
[14:28] enough okay it you're not going to watch
[14:30] a dozen of my videos
[14:32] and come away now i know exactly how to
[14:34] do bias you have to go into the charts
[14:36] and study each day back testing what is
[14:38] back testing going back and looking at
[14:40] moves like this
[14:42] okay
[14:43] marking them up on your chart now you
[14:44] can do it either using the replay button
[14:47] watching them paint partially
[14:49] or you can go back in hindsight and mark
[14:51] up your chart like this this is all back
[14:54] testing
[14:55] all this is is me
[14:57] showing you what i actually did now i
[14:59] was going to be facetious and talk about
[15:01] this for those that didn't really see
[15:03] the videos that i posted today where
[15:05] actually did the pushing of the button
[15:06] here
[15:07] the idea of me seeing it before it
[15:09] happens
[15:10] that's proof of concept and it's proof
[15:12] of understanding
[15:13] okay so
[15:15] i'm the author of this algorithm so i
[15:16] can
[15:17] operate in it very
[15:19] efficiently
[15:21] you as a student of mine you have to
[15:23] understand my language first and then
[15:25] you go into the charts and you study
[15:27] with that language and you'll be able to
[15:29] see repeating phenomena and because
[15:32] you're able to do this in your own
[15:34] leisure
[15:35] you collect these
[15:38] examples of hindsight movement with all
[15:40] of your annotations and your points of
[15:42] interest that you
[15:44] studied and see in your observations
[15:46] anywhere in a chart where it's empty
[15:48] space you want to utilize that and have
[15:50] any kind of observation or encouragement
[15:52] to yourself
[15:53] and you want to tell yourself in those
[15:55] commentaries
[15:56] that
[15:57] you saw this coming
[16:00] okay and what this does is it tricks
[16:02] your brain
[16:03] it's self-talk okay it's one of the
[16:05] things i actually use to overcome
[16:07] agoraphobia which was the fear of being
[16:10] around other people because i had
[16:11] extreme anxiety that started
[16:15] obviously from trading because i built
[16:17] up this large
[16:18] image of myself
[16:20] and in 2001
[16:22] all that stuff happened okay and i was
[16:25] afraid of a lot of things and i had
[16:27] serious anxiety attacks panic attacks
[16:29] that would come on out of nowhere
[16:33] the
[16:34] coping skills that i learned to deal
[16:36] with generalized anxiety
[16:38] i
[16:39] found that were very useful in teaching
[16:41] my students
[16:43] and it was simply by taking
[16:45] positive self-talk placing that into
[16:47] your back testing
[16:49] where you're note taking your
[16:51] by all
[16:54] face value of it you're lying to
[16:57] yourself in these
[17:00] posts in your back testing so in your
[17:02] study journal only you were seeing it
[17:04] but you're tricking your brain and your
[17:05] subconscious because you're writing it
[17:07] out in your own words you're studying it
[17:09] you're looking at it your subconscious
[17:11] is retaining the image but it's also
[17:13] retaining what you're saying in it so
[17:15] when you come back to it at the end of
[17:16] the week or the previous weeks
[17:18] back testing log journals
[17:21] you read them
[17:23] and when you read them to yourself
[17:25] you're reading your own words saying i
[17:26] saw this setting up where this was
[17:29] likely to drop down here and i was
[17:30] expecting this turn here because the
[17:32] fair value got i wanted to see this
[17:33] displacement and it occurred just like i
[17:35] was expecting and it comes back down and
[17:37] allows me an opportunity to go long
[17:39] then i expected the market to move
[17:41] aggressively away from this area and
[17:43] start working towards the short-term
[17:44] highs
[17:45] and i wanted to take something off above
[17:47] halfway high to low i want to take a
[17:51] premium profit scaling and that's what
[17:53] that is there
[17:54] so
[17:55] you're pouring yourself into the chart
[17:58] with your annotations for back testing
[18:00] and you're doing it in such a way where
[18:02] you're tricking your subconscious like
[18:04] you expected this to happen and over
[18:06] time when you do that you're recording
[18:08] this subconsciously you don't realize
[18:10] you're doing it but
[18:11] by doing these things over and over and
[18:13] over again it activates your reticular
[18:14] activating system it's the same thing
[18:16] happens when you buy a car you go out
[18:19] the next day all of a sudden it seems
[18:20] like everybody else bought the same car
[18:22] the only difference is is you've been
[18:24] more sensitive to that because it's more
[18:26] meaningful to you so these charts will
[18:28] take on that same characteristic when
[18:30] you make them more meaningful to you how
[18:32] do you do that you place your
[18:34] personality
[18:36] and your interest in the chart so
[18:38] everything here i'm giving you a
[18:39] narrative here you would do the same
[18:41] thing just typing it out putting it in
[18:43] there and then screen capturing it and
[18:44] storing it in your journal or printing
[18:46] it out and putting in your journal
[18:48] those things over time
[18:50] will start building on your subconscious
[18:53] as pseudo-memories
[18:55] so
[18:57] critics that hear me say this you're
[18:58] like oh you're you know this fraud's
[19:00] telling you to lie to yourself
[19:04] i'm being honest you are lying in the
[19:06] chart when you do your annotations for
[19:08] study purposes you're tricking your
[19:10] brain
[19:11] like you had experience seeing this
[19:14] happen but because over time you're
[19:16] doing that your subconscious will retain
[19:18] that and when you start seeing it live
[19:21] it will remember hey i remember that
[19:23] because i did that before when you
[19:25] technically really didn't
[19:27] but then now you have pseudo experience
[19:31] it sounds
[19:32] strange like it couldn't possibly work
[19:34] like this but it does
[19:35] our brains are extremely
[19:38] intricate they're very powerful but they
[19:40] can be short-circuited a little bit and
[19:43] used
[19:44] in an advantageous way of studying
[19:46] and this is one way i teach my students
[19:48] in mentorship and this is what i'm
[19:51] trying to suggest that you do for your
[19:52] back testing all you have to do is look
[19:54] at old moves study them annotate your
[19:56] charts it's as rich as you want that
[19:58] chart to be
[20:00] that's what you're doing you're trying
[20:01] to make it as
[20:03] meaningful to you as you possibly can
[20:06] and
[20:07] over time you'll create a
[20:10] measure of pseudo experience
[20:13] that will build upon
[20:15] over time how much time it i don't know
[20:17] it although you're gonna develop at your
[20:19] own pace
[20:21] and you're going to arrive at full
[20:22] understanding
[20:24] right on time
[20:25] so it might be a couple weeks for some
[20:27] of you may take a year for others it may
[20:29] take a little bit longer than that it
[20:31] depends on what you pour yourself into
[20:33] by doing it
[20:35] and i'll leave that part up for you to
[20:37] decide how much effort you're going to
[20:38] put into it but
[20:40] i wanted to share something today and
[20:42] kind of like answer those individuals
[20:44] that like to say that mt4 rented servers
[20:47] were used and stuff and i don't need
[20:49] that folks i mean it's not necessary
[20:51] so
[20:53] um
[20:55] let's
[20:57] go over here
[21:01] and you can see
[21:05] there's a hundred thousand
[21:07] and there's some red in there folks yeah
[21:09] two back-to-back losing trades
[21:18] okay
[21:19] and that was
[21:21] the business
[21:24] okay that was uh since the sixth of this
[21:26] month
[21:27] 100 000 account to 354 000 paper trading
[21:30] obviously but
[21:32] that's what i was doing on twitter all
[21:34] those years i was showing and showing
[21:35] and showing
[21:36] and this proves
[21:39] concept it proves that these things work
[21:42] i'm looking at live data when i'm doing
[21:44] this this is actually no delay you can
[21:46] see there's no d up here there's no
[21:47] little dot showing you it's as real as
[21:49] real can be okay
[21:51] if i can't see these things happening
[21:53] before it happens it will fail
[21:55] but if i can see them live
[21:57] forming
[21:58] and i haven't understand what the
[21:59] algorithm is going to do then i should
[22:01] be able to operate like this
[22:03] and i saw a comment today on
[22:06] one of the video vignettes i did
[22:08] and can we get past the drama and
[22:10] proving who made money
[22:13] i'm not sure what the poster intended
[22:16] with that because i thought
[22:18] that was what you wanted to see when you
[22:20] came here like why would you come to my
[22:22] channel or anyone else's channel that
[22:24] has anything to do with technical
[22:26] analysis or trading
[22:27] if they can't prove they can do what
[22:29] they say they can do
[22:30] all i'm doing
[22:32] is sharing
[22:33] my experience
[22:35] and the prowess i have if i can't do
[22:37] this i'll follow my face i can do it and
[22:41] i want to be an encouragement to those
[22:43] that are genuinely concerned because
[22:45] they see stupid stuff posted on the
[22:46] internet
[22:48] folks listen
[22:49] i don't know
[22:51] how much of this you need to see before
[22:53] you finally get over it but i don't mind
[22:55] doing it okay i don't mind doing it i
[22:58] enjoy doing this i enjoy sharing it and
[23:00] i know it's an encouragement to people
[23:02] that had a little bit of doubt say hey
[23:04] look you know
[23:05] did you really use an mt4 rented server
[23:07] on twitter because we don't really see
[23:10] it we just hear other people talking
[23:11] about it well here's again more proof
[23:14] that listen this is just a matter of
[23:16] like a week or so okay
[23:18] um in five and a half weeks or six weeks
[23:21] i could easily do what i'm doing here
[23:24] and it compounds over and over and over
[23:26] again okay
[23:28] just because
[23:30] i'm doing it with a demo account
[23:32] doesn't mean that you're gonna be able
[23:33] to go out there and do it too with a
[23:34] live account the only thing i'm showing
[23:37] you here is i understand what i'm doing
[23:40] so i think that's going to be it for
[23:41] tonight and i will touch base with you
[23:43] lord willing next tuesday for another
[23:46] lecture
[23:47] and probably a little bit longer video
[23:49] then okay until then enjoy your weekend
[23:51] be safe
