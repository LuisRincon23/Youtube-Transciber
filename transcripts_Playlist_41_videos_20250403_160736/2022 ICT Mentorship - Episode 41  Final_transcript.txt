[00:07] all right folks welcome back
[00:09] this is our review and
[00:11] final
[00:12] discussion
[00:14] in the free 2022 ict mentorship for
[00:16] youtube
[00:18] so this is june 23rd
[00:21] 2022
[00:22] and we're looking at the
[00:24] e-mini s p september contract for 2022
[00:28] and this is an hourly chart so i'm
[00:29] cutting right to the chase here
[00:32] and this morning on twitter i was
[00:34] looking at
[00:35] well i was expecting actually a little
[00:36] bit more volatility
[00:38] around the fed chair pal speaking
[00:41] at 10 o'clock in the morning and we
[00:44] didn't get a whole lot of excitement
[00:46] but
[00:48] we did get to see
[00:50] ict's expectation
[00:53] fall short
[00:54] so that's one of the benefits of seeing
[00:57] it live with me
[00:59] an expectation an analysis a call a
[01:02] viewpoint a perspective
[01:04] opinion
[01:07] not coming to pass
[01:09] okay
[01:10] and
[01:12] time of day
[01:14] how i used it
[01:16] and how you should use it going forward
[01:18] and also how it kept me from looking at
[01:21] an incorrect
[01:23] setup that would otherwise
[01:25] maybe
[01:28] a catalyst for you having had a
[01:30] incorrect
[01:32] setup this morning and i'll talk about
[01:33] that in a moment but for now this is the
[01:35] framework
[01:36] for today
[01:39] we had sell side liquidity here the
[01:41] market dropped down took that sell side
[01:43] out rallied up
[01:46] buy side here i was looking for 38.05
[01:49] level today and this is the reason why
[01:53] and i was looking at it early on in the
[01:54] morning
[01:55] i wanted to see it run up here and hit
[01:57] that
[01:58] if it was going to hit
[02:01] i would have been watching for
[02:02] a potential short deform
[02:04] but
[02:06] it didn't do it so that was my
[02:08] expectation based on this high back here
[02:10] we already took sell aside so i was
[02:12] looking for a little bit deeper run into
[02:14] this high here
[02:16] when we just went just above that short
[02:18] term high
[02:19] there gave up the ghost and went lower
[02:22] and i had a trade that got stopped out
[02:24] plus two points and i'll talk about that
[02:26] and get into
[02:28] the lower time time frame
[02:30] all right so here is the 15 minute time
[02:32] frame
[02:34] and usually i have
[02:36] the charts blank and i'll ask you to
[02:38] take a look at it i don't want to do
[02:39] that tonight because i want to get to
[02:41] the teachings at the end
[02:43] to kind of like bring this entire
[02:45] mentorship to a close
[02:47] the teachings itself will end for this
[02:50] model in this
[02:52] lesson okay so technically there's 41
[02:54] videos that make up this mentorship so
[02:57] if you take away the introductory video
[03:00] it's basically what 40
[03:02] even so that's not bad hopefully you
[03:04] found it insightful and helpful but
[03:06] looking at this morning
[03:08] we had the 10 o'clock pal
[03:12] event here
[03:14] and the market started to run up
[03:16] and we took out the buy side here but
[03:18] again i was aiming for this this is what
[03:19] i wanted to see i want to see it run up
[03:21] here and actually took a long in here i
[03:23] wanted to see it
[03:24] run up into that level and i was going
[03:25] to do a reversal
[03:27] and it didn't obviously give it to me
[03:30] so notice the time of day here
[03:34] this is new york index am session
[03:37] operating hours or killzone if you want
[03:39] to call it that
[03:40] and it's 8 30 in the morning to 11.
[03:43] now
[03:44] i can take trades
[03:46] after 11 o'clock but i want to kind of
[03:48] like stick to the rules
[03:51] and
[03:52] present you opportunities to see where
[03:55] following the rules you're going to miss
[03:56] certain opportunities
[03:58] it's okay it's fine
[04:01] now you're going to get it wrong
[04:02] sometimes
[04:03] you watch me get something wrong today
[04:06] there was no skin off my back nothing
[04:09] you know bad happened is i didn't get
[04:11] what i was looking for
[04:12] and because it was late in the day
[04:15] as we'll look at the
[04:17] lower time frame in a moment but
[04:19] it ran above the short term by side
[04:21] liquidity here
[04:22] i wanted to run up to here
[04:24] but it broke down and i was telling
[04:27] myself and also made my views public on
[04:30] twitter
[04:31] that i wasn't interested and i wasn't
[04:32] quite sure what it wanted to do
[04:34] because it was
[04:36] approaching that noon hour
[04:38] and i took a trade
[04:40] and i was out plus two so in other words
[04:42] i was just covering expenses basically
[04:47] and i was wrong on the initial run
[04:50] so when i have that scenario and it's
[04:52] off of
[04:53] a fed chair
[04:55] or a high impact news event and it
[04:57] didn't pan out like i was expecting it
[04:58] to
[05:00] in my experience it's been better for me
[05:02] to just move away
[05:03] and say okay i'm going to close the
[05:04] computer and i'll come back later on and
[05:06] see what's going on
[05:08] and i didn't want to trade any more of
[05:10] the morning session
[05:12] leading into noon
[05:14] so i had waited and i was gonna take a
[05:17] look at what it did in lunch hour and
[05:18] then post lunch hour around 1 30 and see
[05:21] what there was
[05:22] opportunity to do anything then
[05:24] but
[05:26] we have a fair value gap on the
[05:28] 15-minute time frame here
[05:30] you see that
[05:32] so the market eventually after running
[05:34] the bus side here
[05:35] drew all the way down took out cell side
[05:37] here overrun this fair value gap here
[05:41] why did it do that because this is a
[05:42] larger one so if it's going to go over
[05:44] top of this one
[05:45] and trade to the top
[05:47] of this candle which is the low end of
[05:49] that fair value gap that's here
[05:50] that's not noted on shown here
[05:53] by the
[05:54] respective candles
[05:56] it's going to go here
[05:57] that's also
[05:59] the high end of the fair value gap here
[06:02] so it's likely to go over top of this
[06:03] one and run into this one
[06:05] okay it does that as we're going into
[06:08] the noon lunch hour in new york
[06:10] until one o'clock
[06:11] where it makes the low of the
[06:14] session
[06:15] after closing in the fair value gap
[06:17] and then the 1 30
[06:20] to 4
[06:22] new york local time
[06:23] that's the pm session new york index pm
[06:26] session or afternoon session for index
[06:28] trading
[06:30] and the market started to create a
[06:32] willingness to want to go higher
[06:34] we'll look at a short-term shift in
[06:35] market structure when we get a lower
[06:36] time frame
[06:38] but it draws all the way back up to the
[06:40] target i was looking for
[06:42] in the morning
[06:44] so
[06:46] the expectation of going to that
[06:47] specific level
[06:49] let me explain to you what i was looking
[06:50] for
[06:51] i wanted to go above hit that and then
[06:54] sell off and go down to this area here
[06:56] for a discount and then create
[06:58] the run
[07:00] and then go beyond 3805 that's all i was
[07:02] really looking for today that's what i
[07:04] wanted to do but it failed to get to
[07:06] 3805
[07:08] it fell down into this area here and i
[07:10] knew once it broke here i don't want to
[07:12] go short because
[07:13] i'm going into lunch hour and i was
[07:15] concerned it was going to consolidate a
[07:16] lot and then take forever to get down
[07:19] into and i don't want to hold anything
[07:20] new into
[07:22] lunch
[07:23] so
[07:24] i'd prefer to see some kind of a
[07:26] a stop run
[07:28] in the lunch hour which is what we're
[07:30] seeing here
[07:32] it runs down below that and into a fair
[07:34] value gap deep discount between low
[07:37] high trades down into it and then
[07:39] rallies up
[07:43] this session here we'll look at it
[07:47] on the five-minute chart
[07:52] so we can see obviously the initial
[07:54] poke above here
[07:56] inside this area i was looking at a two
[07:59] minute fair value gap i mentioned that
[08:01] on twitter as it was forming
[08:04] and it rallied up
[08:06] and then
[08:07] once it took the short-term high out
[08:09] when this was a bold face bullish candle
[08:12] i was thinking to myself okay it could
[08:14] expand up in here and i'm watching that
[08:16] and i had a tweet ready to go i'm gonna
[08:20] sell short here and look for a run down
[08:22] into this level here never got it okay
[08:24] and then some of you probably gonna hear
[08:26] this and say oh yeah sure you sure you
[08:28] did i mean it is what it is folks i mean
[08:30] i was out there without a safety net i
[08:32] told everyone what i was expecting what
[08:34] i was looking for it simply didn't pan
[08:36] out and that's okay
[08:38] but the market eventually breaks lower
[08:40] then after we get in to the lunch hour
[08:42] closing at one o'clock and then
[08:45] i personally like to wait till 1 30
[08:47] because it's a little bit more cleaner
[08:48] price action
[08:49] the market starts to rally away
[08:52] drops back down into an order block a
[08:54] fair value gap on a five-minute chart
[08:57] then we have a shift in market structure
[08:59] here on the five-minute chart
[09:01] creates a small little return to a fair
[09:03] bag gap there rallies another fair value
[09:05] it runs into it here rallies and
[09:08] eventually takes up the short-term high
[09:10] of the day and then runs to the level i
[09:12] was drawing your attention to on twitter
[09:17] all right so here's the five-minute
[09:19] chart zoomed in with the morning session
[09:22] you see the run here on the buy side one
[09:24] more here
[09:25] and
[09:26] eventually breaking down
[09:29] displacement
[09:30] small little fair value got
[09:32] here rolls down into the fairway you got
[09:36] here and then once again
[09:38] you're turning back up into an imbalance
[09:40] then runs down to the low end of the
[09:42] thereby you got
[09:43] turning basically at the low of the
[09:46] session at
[09:48] the low end of the fair value got
[09:50] at one o'clock so closure of lunch
[09:53] time hour
[09:55] it creates that low
[10:04] right here is the two minute chart
[10:06] and this is the fair value gap i drew
[10:08] your attention to live
[10:10] and it came down into it here
[10:13] and
[10:14] inside this fairbank app is of basically
[10:16] drawing your attention to that as a
[10:18] potential long i did and i was looking
[10:20] for a run into 3805
[10:22] and it started the run took out the buy
[10:25] side here i mentioned the bicep would
[10:26] likely be a draw on liquidity it was
[10:29] but i wanted to see it draw up to here
[10:32] that's the specific level i was looking
[10:34] for
[10:34] and if the market comes back down into
[10:36] the fairbank up again once more
[10:39] and then rallies above the short-term
[10:40] high here this right here would have
[10:42] been a nice opportunity for me to
[10:44] basically say pay the trader and me take
[10:47] something after i tweeted that off
[10:50] but i didn't because i wanted this level
[10:52] here okay
[10:55] now one could argue and say oh you're
[10:56] being greedy or you didn't follow rules
[10:58] or you didn't do this and you didn't do
[11:00] that and it's easy to arm chair
[11:01] quarterback someone
[11:03] and that's okay if you want to do that
[11:04] in the comment section that's fine but
[11:07] just know that i'm doing this
[11:09] real time
[11:10] and i'm okay with being wrong wrong
[11:12] isn't going to ruin me um
[11:16] i'm not 100
[11:17] but i'm generally
[11:19] on par
[11:20] better than the average bear okay
[11:23] we'll just say it that way without
[11:24] sounding like i'm bragging
[11:26] but once it
[11:27] came back down in it stopped me out
[11:29] because i rolled my stop up to a level
[11:31] that i wasn't willing to
[11:33] weather a deeper retracement because
[11:34] this is the takeaway
[11:36] very valuable
[11:37] we trade down into it we get
[11:39] movement that's good comes back down and
[11:42] again complete closure of the fair value
[11:44] gap okay that's acceptable
[11:46] does it start to rally away yes that's
[11:48] why i felt confident that it was going
[11:50] to go up to here
[11:51] because if it's going to go above here
[11:52] then it should just spread its wings and
[11:54] run that 3805 level with no problem
[11:57] it wasn't having it
[11:59] the market dropped back down
[12:01] and didn't quite take out this
[12:03] short-term load with any displacement so
[12:05] while this fair value gap exists
[12:07] it's not one that i would have taken
[12:09] because we didn't see a displacement
[12:11] with meaningful
[12:13] movement below that low so this is not a
[12:16] fair gap that i would have been a
[12:17] participant in
[12:18] so
[12:19] looking at that i'm thinking i'm not
[12:21] interested i'm going to close up shop
[12:24] and there it is because i didn't get
[12:26] this run below here now
[12:28] had i seen that i may have i'm not going
[12:30] to go out on a limb and say absolutely
[12:32] but i may have if it would have shown
[12:34] like this type of movement on this
[12:36] candle below that low and then we move
[12:38] back up into this right here then i
[12:39] probably would have said well i'm gonna
[12:41] go short and aim for this low here
[12:44] and then at noon if i didn't get here i
[12:46] would just close it off
[12:48] and then
[12:49] ride out the the lunch hour so that was
[12:51] kind of like what was going on in my
[12:52] head
[12:54] because it was an event around pal i
[12:55] didn't want to give you guys a lot of
[12:57] things to be concerned about or get lost
[13:00] in the commentary and plus i didn't want
[13:01] to be worrying about
[13:03] someone doing something hurting
[13:04] themselves i knew invariably some of you
[13:06] are
[13:07] waiting there with a live account ready
[13:08] to click a button because i've said
[13:10] something okay so that weighs heavily on
[13:12] me
[13:13] when i comment on twitter so
[13:19] i just want you to be careful okay do it
[13:21] in a demo don't do it a live account
[13:24] but we had another fair value gap in
[13:26] here it trades up into that nice closure
[13:28] perfectly and runs down to the top of
[13:30] the fair value gap on that 15 minute
[13:31] time frame one more little bounce in
[13:34] then rolls over and goes deeper into the
[13:36] fair value cap
[13:42] all right here is the afternoon session
[13:44] and this is where we're gonna be doing
[13:46] the bulk of the discussion on the
[13:47] reading course in this video
[13:50] and i'll frame the logic around
[13:52] risk management and stop loss management
[13:55] and that'll complete the model the roles
[13:57] i'm going to give you are static they
[14:00] they're always the same so that way you
[14:02] know
[14:02] once you put a position on your demo
[14:04] account where is your stop how much are
[14:06] you risking
[14:08] when do you move your stop
[14:10] okay and this is the rule that i use and
[14:15] sometimes
[14:17] um you've seen me
[14:18] show
[14:19] trades where i get in and i'm not really
[14:21] trying to move my stop-loss i'm taking
[14:23] partials along the way but i'm not
[14:25] really trying to
[14:26] rush my stop-loss up
[14:28] i'm going to show you the rules i follow
[14:30] so that way it makes sense to you and
[14:32] it'll help you also
[14:34] trust taking partials
[14:36] letting that become a better way of
[14:37] managing a position in trade
[14:40] and not be fearful about being stopped
[14:41] out because the stop loss is there to do
[14:44] its job you pay it well to do that but
[14:47] if you're worrying about that stop loss
[14:48] being tripped versus following along in
[14:51] price action continuously measuring
[14:53] whether or not price is giving you what
[14:55] you're expecting in terms of bullishness
[14:57] or bearishness is the institutional
[14:58] order flow still bullish if you're long
[15:00] or is it still bearish when you're
[15:02] you know short
[15:03] those types of things are more important
[15:05] than worrying about whether you're
[15:06] getting stopped out or not
[15:08] that's not to minimize obviously the
[15:10] the risk that's respected obviously you
[15:13] should be respecting the risk by
[15:15] actually putting a hard stop in but if
[15:16] you don't put a hard stop in you're not
[15:18] really respecting the risk what you're
[15:19] saying is is
[15:21] i'm risking this trade because i believe
[15:24] i'm right but if i'm wrong i'll figure
[15:26] out
[15:27] where i'm wrong when it gets there
[15:29] you don't want to do that okay so anyway
[15:33] we'll close that portion of the
[15:35] discussion at the end of the video but
[15:36] here it's a two-minute chart showing the
[15:38] afternoon or pm session for
[15:41] index futures
[15:42] and you can see we traded down into
[15:45] this is showing a weird time because
[15:47] it's
[15:48] two minutes but this is the one o'clock
[15:51] hour it hits the low
[15:53] and then starts to rally up
[15:55] short term shift in market structure
[15:57] here key time of day
[16:00] 130 it trades back down into an order
[16:02] block last down closed candle there is a
[16:05] fair value gap
[16:07] right here
[16:08] i didn't note it because it's going to
[16:10] be too cluttered up and i'm going to be
[16:12] basically doing a lot of discussion in
[16:14] this area and i don't want it to be
[16:15] over
[16:17] lapped with too many things
[16:19] to me navigating
[16:20] so this is the 50 minute
[16:22] fair value gap and it's trading down to
[16:24] an order block after a shift in market
[16:26] structure after trading down and closing
[16:27] in a 15 minute time frame
[16:30] fair egg gap
[16:31] and then it trades into an optimal trade
[16:34] entry which is the flagship pattern of
[16:36] this youtube channel
[16:38] fair value gap with an overblock and
[16:39] optimal trade entry is the
[16:43] gold standard
[16:44] of the ict pattern that's taught on this
[16:47] youtube channel
[16:49] this is where you can be long
[16:51] and expect price to reach for
[16:54] here
[16:55] and here
[16:57] okay so we have
[16:59] objectives in here where we can look for
[17:02] this imbalance here
[17:04] bicep liquidity here by side liquidity
[17:06] here
[17:07] and we'll watch then see it does it
[17:09] continuously march higher
[17:11] so
[17:12] we have a run from here
[17:14] to the short term high
[17:16] then we have this fair value got here
[17:17] that runs here up into
[17:19] the 3805 level
[17:21] so
[17:22] this pm session i was long in
[17:26] and i'm
[17:27] not going to try to build the case to
[17:31] outline everything because i want to
[17:32] give you what's salient to close this
[17:35] mentorship and show you how to use stop
[17:37] placement risk management
[17:39] and give you a working example
[17:41] i know some of you like to see
[17:43] did i really take a
[17:44] trade yeah i was trading today so you
[17:47] can see here a live account
[17:50] and
[17:51] 1 975
[17:53] okay
[17:55] back to the lesson
[17:57] and you'll see what it means to go
[17:58] through the process of determining
[18:01] risk management
[18:03] and stop
[18:04] loss placement and when you move your
[18:06] stop
[18:10] all right so we're zoomed in here
[18:13] and looking at the five-minute chart
[18:15] and again that's the fair value gap
[18:17] we're going to be using
[18:18] here the frame it
[18:21] so if you're looking at the idea of
[18:24] you trade it down into that very value
[18:26] gap
[18:28] does it show willingness to go higher
[18:29] yes is there a short term shift in
[18:31] market structure yes
[18:33] is there a gap yes down close candle to
[18:36] the left of it yes
[18:37] drops down in bullish order block
[18:40] optimal trade entry in other words that
[18:42] would be a 62 to 70 tracement level less
[18:44] than equilibrium relative to the high
[18:47] and the low respectively
[18:49] so we would be looking for
[18:51] a limit order
[18:54] to be at
[18:55] 37
[18:56] 54 75 we'll use that okay so one quarter
[18:59] point less than
[19:01] this candle's low so that would be our
[19:03] hypothetical limit order to buy
[19:06] going long
[19:08] and we use the low here for our stop
[19:10] loss
[19:11] so 37 45
[19:13] 0.75
[19:16] essentially
[19:17] nine points of risk
[19:19] okay so we'll come back that in a couple
[19:22] minutes but for now
[19:23] what will be reaching for what would be
[19:25] the draw on liquidity
[19:27] from this high
[19:28] down to that low we want to get to a
[19:30] premium level
[19:32] 50 is about right in here eyeballing it
[19:34] and we don't need to have a fib on that
[19:35] you should do it for yourself
[19:37] but then we have this imbalance here so
[19:39] the first low hanging fruit objective
[19:41] would be this candle's high
[19:43] that's 37 80 and a quarter
[19:46] so we're looking at about
[19:47] 25 and a half handles
[19:50] of potential points profit
[19:53] per contract so we're risking nine
[19:55] points to make 25 and a half
[19:58] not bad it's better than two and a half
[20:00] r
[20:01] so you're gonna risk
[20:02] one dollar to make two dollars and fifty
[20:04] cents basically
[20:06] and that's on a run from here to here
[20:09] we don't need to know if it's going to
[20:11] go up to here yet
[20:12] okay
[20:13] this right here is one trade from here
[20:15] to here
[20:17] then it creates another opportunity in
[20:19] here where it can run from here to here
[20:21] and we'll talk about that when it gets
[20:23] into the discussion on risk management
[20:25] and trade management
[20:32] all right so risk management
[20:36] anytime you're trying to consider what
[20:39] lot size or how much you're supposed to
[20:41] be trading or whatever
[20:43] there are free tools if you google them
[20:45] okay it's amazing how many folks ask me
[20:48] and other educators out there the most
[20:50] simplest
[20:51] questions that are answered just by a
[20:53] google search okay i know
[20:56] it feels easier i think it's a matter of
[20:58] just
[20:59] getting a personal response from the
[21:00] educator or whoever it is you'd be
[21:02] asking
[21:03] and
[21:05] it's not
[21:07] possible for me to go through every
[21:08] single person's question
[21:10] and reply to them so hopefully you
[21:12] understand that there's just simply no
[21:13] way for me to do that i don't have
[21:14] enough time in the day to do that nobody
[21:17] really does
[21:18] but simple things like
[21:21] lot size calculators okay you can do a
[21:24] google search on that and there are some
[21:26] wonderful free applications and tools
[21:28] that will make that known to you
[21:31] by you just plugging in how much money
[21:32] you have in your account
[21:34] what risk percentage are you trying to
[21:35] use
[21:37] what size stop-loss are you going to use
[21:38] and it'll tell you
[21:40] how much
[21:41] leverage if you're trading forex or you
[21:44] know what your
[21:46] lot size should be for futures
[21:49] now
[21:50] i understand that's probably not the
[21:52] response that you want because you want
[21:53] to have a interactive experience with
[21:55] your educator or mentor but these are
[21:58] really basic types of things that could
[22:00] be learned and understood and found the
[22:02] solution to by
[22:04] simply doing a little bit of the legwork
[22:05] yourself
[22:07] with that said i'm going to give you one
[22:09] example here and just kind of like walk
[22:11] it out for you
[22:12] assuming you had ten thousand dollars in
[22:14] your trading index futures
[22:16] and you are using this trade idea that
[22:18] i'm outlining here that i was monitoring
[22:20] in the afternoon session
[22:23] ten thousand dollars is equity you want
[22:25] to take
[22:26] one percent risk
[22:28] per trade
[22:30] so you're gonna take that ten thousand
[22:31] dollars
[22:32] times it by point zero one that's going
[22:34] to give you a figure of one hundred
[22:36] that's one hundred dollars that's what
[22:38] one percent of ten thousand dollars is
[22:40] that means that's the total amount of
[22:42] risk that you're willing to assume
[22:45] we determined from the hypothetical
[22:47] entry of your demo account at 37.54 and
[22:50] three quarters and a stop at
[22:53] 45 and three quarters that's nine points
[22:56] or nine handles okay
[22:59] that's what that nine is
[23:00] so we're taking the dollar amount
[23:02] which is the one percent of our equity
[23:06] giving us hundred dollars or one percent
[23:08] of ten thousand dollars
[23:10] total movement that we're willing to
[23:12] absorb as a risk or a stop loss
[23:15] is nine points
[23:16] so we take nine divide that into one
[23:18] hundred that gives us eleven
[23:21] okay 11
[23:24] times
[23:25] we can get
[23:26] the figure 9.
[23:29] that 11
[23:31] if we're going to trade a
[23:33] mini
[23:34] or e-mini futures contract on the s p
[23:36] the multiplier per contract is 50 bucks
[23:39] so divide 50 into 11. you can't so you
[23:43] right away you know you can't trade a
[23:45] mini if you're gonna be risking one
[23:46] percent
[23:47] so you have to drop down into the micros
[23:50] so now we have 11 with a multiple of
[23:52] five so micro lot
[23:54] on e-mini micro instead of fifty dollars
[23:57] per point
[23:59] it's five dollars per point
[24:02] so how many
[24:03] fives can you go into 11 with it
[24:06] two so you can do two micro lots
[24:09] now this might not be for you because
[24:12] when i do risk management
[24:14] i don't really factor in commissions
[24:15] i'll just do the math like this so you
[24:18] might look at that and say well what
[24:20] about commissions that might not allow
[24:22] me to do one percent if you're going to
[24:23] be very hard-lined about the risk
[24:24] management and i get it some of you
[24:26] should be like that in the beginning
[24:28] but as you get more experience you'll
[24:30] start thinking oh you know the covered
[24:32] costs of
[24:33] commissions and such
[24:35] over time it's fine i'll work that out
[24:38] but for risk management just for the
[24:41] entry to stop loss not factoring
[24:44] commission costs and fees with your
[24:46] broker
[24:48] or spread okay all those ideas
[24:51] need to be considered
[24:52] but we're going to assume that they're
[24:54] not going to be considered for this
[24:55] example you have to figure that out on
[24:57] your own if that's how you're going to
[24:58] do your risk management but for me
[25:00] i don't ever factor in the cost because
[25:02] costs are always going to be they're
[25:03] like taxes you can't avoid them
[25:05] so just you eat it okay
[25:08] so
[25:09] you can do two micro lots
[25:11] at five dollars per
[25:13] point
[25:15] making profit or taking in drawdown or
[25:18] loss
[25:19] per point fluctuation
[25:23] so if we're buying at 37.54 in three
[25:25] quarters
[25:26] and we're risking nine
[25:29] points
[25:32] how much money is that
[25:35] ninety dollars risk so we're under
[25:37] one percent
[25:39] so we're not even risking a full one
[25:40] percent
[25:42] our target is 25 and a half points
[25:46] or 255 dollars because two micro
[25:49] at five dollars at the multiplier of
[25:51] each point
[25:53] two times five is ten so you're making
[25:55] 10 dollars per point
[25:56] because you're holding 2 micros
[25:59] so 25 and a half points here at 10
[26:03] total multiplier
[26:05] based on the two micro lots
[26:07] which would be
[26:08] basically two and a quarter percent
[26:10] return
[26:11] so you're gonna risk one percent to make
[26:12] two and a quarter percent on one
[26:14] intraday scalp
[26:16] here
[26:17] and then you have another one here
[26:19] and if you were trying to do shorts over
[26:20] here you could have done something
[26:21] equivalent to that as well
[26:23] so it's not hard to make
[26:25] one to three to five percent in one day
[26:30] with intraday
[26:31] price swings
[26:33] the problem is
[26:34] you're going to get over excited and
[26:36] think that you can do every single
[26:38] fluctuation in price action
[26:40] and
[26:41] these types of movements while they're
[26:43] exciting when you do the math on them
[26:44] and you see the potential
[26:46] a lot of times people say well one
[26:48] percent i can't make money with one
[26:49] percent
[26:51] man you can make a lot of money with one
[26:52] percent okay
[26:54] if you if you can make one percent a day
[26:57] that's enormous because that compounds
[26:59] over time
[27:00] and it's not a matter of saying well
[27:04] if i make one percent a day and i do
[27:05] that monday through friday that means i
[27:07] need five percent of the end of the week
[27:09] or
[27:10] 20 for the month
[27:12] correct that's what most of you are
[27:13] probably thinking right now
[27:15] when in fact you're actually
[27:17] able to get 22 a month because of the
[27:20] effects of compounding if you do one
[27:22] percent per day
[27:25] trading monday through friday four weeks
[27:27] average per month
[27:29] one could make 22 percent a month now 22
[27:32] percent a month is phenomenal like
[27:34] that's ridiculous rates of return
[27:38] professional money managers and fund
[27:39] managers don't try to do that for a
[27:42] whole year
[27:43] some of them do anywhere between
[27:46] 12 to 15 percent a year and they call
[27:48] that an ex stellar year
[27:50] and if they make 20 or more you know
[27:52] that's a blockbuster year
[27:54] and their parade around in front of
[27:55] their clients thing
[27:57] exceed that type of return and bolster
[28:00] their confidence to put more money in
[28:02] that's usually when they'll say hey you
[28:03] want to allocate more money
[28:04] because they get paid to do that
[28:08] well one percent
[28:10] is in my opinion obviously you know it's
[28:12] not going to be the case for a new
[28:13] student or a new trader but my opinion
[28:15] one percent every single day
[28:19] is unrealistic
[28:21] but for a seasoned trader
[28:24] one percent average per day is
[28:27] really easy
[28:29] but you're gonna have to get the
[28:30] experience to do that
[28:32] and again that also
[28:34] equates to the average of one percent so
[28:36] in other words if i have one trade a
[28:38] week and i make five percent that's
[28:40] equivalent to one percent a day
[28:43] for the week i'm not going to sit in
[28:45] front of the charts
[28:46] to try to make one percent each day it's
[28:48] it's not reasonable for me i have things
[28:50] i have to take care of i have businesses
[28:52] to run and family to tend to
[28:55] and i can find setups that
[28:57] i can frame and make you know five
[28:59] percent on one set up or first partial
[29:02] of a trade
[29:03] so
[29:05] it's a matter how you're gonna form fit
[29:06] this for yourself okay and obviously the
[29:09] best scenario would be if you're going
[29:11] to be eventually getting to the point
[29:12] where you can risk two percent you can
[29:14] do this framework for one limit order to
[29:16] be buying at 37 54 and three quarters
[29:19] use to stop as explained here
[29:21] and do a second order the same way but
[29:24] don't use this as your profit objective
[29:27] use this short term high here
[29:30] or the target i was outlining 3805
[29:33] and a half
[29:35] and then you would be able to get
[29:36] a run from here to here on one that
[29:39] would close out
[29:40] and then the second one would hopefully
[29:41] run up in here and get the daily range
[29:45] and you can do obviously better than
[29:47] you need two and a quarter percent just
[29:49] on this one
[29:50] you'd have
[29:52] two and a quarter
[29:54] twice because the one that you bought
[29:57] down i'm sorry the one you bought here
[29:58] they got out here
[30:00] that's your banked two and a quarter
[30:01] percent hypothetically then the second
[30:03] one would be running here and then
[30:05] rolling through that level up to here so
[30:08] you could be making as much as
[30:10] four and a half percent more on the
[30:12] second position so what are you really
[30:14] making
[30:15] six and three quarter percent
[30:18] one day
[30:20] two orders one trade
[30:24] and a lot of you guys are trying to do
[30:26] those funded account challenges
[30:27] and they give you like you got to make
[30:29] 10
[30:30] to do this and that
[30:32] if you learn how to trade and you learn
[30:33] what i'm teaching you folks listen
[30:37] those numbers are achievable
[30:39] but you have to know what you're doing
[30:42] and also how to weather drawdown
[30:45] drawdown
[30:47] would be
[30:48] having your account
[30:50] reduced from either its starting balance
[30:52] or after you've made equity increases
[30:55] you start taking losses that's drawdown
[30:57] well that drawdown has to be managed so
[31:00] if you have a trade
[31:02] and for instance say you took this
[31:03] hypothetical trade here with one
[31:05] order and you got in at that 37 54 and
[31:07] three quarters and you got stopped out
[31:09] down here okay you would have taken
[31:12] less than one percent loss
[31:14] so
[31:15] your next trade
[31:17] you should do half of one percent
[31:20] why because number one you have emotions
[31:22] psychological impact of taking a loss
[31:24] you're going to be most likely wanting
[31:25] to have revenge
[31:27] and you're probably going to want to do
[31:28] more leverage than you should
[31:30] and you're probably going to want to get
[31:31] it faster than you should in other words
[31:33] being patient is not going to be the
[31:34] right thing for you you're going to feel
[31:36] like
[31:37] impatience is
[31:38] eating at you so therefore you have to
[31:40] get right back in there and try to get
[31:41] your money back and that is a loser's
[31:43] cycle
[31:44] gambler's mentality
[31:47] so by reducing the risk on your next
[31:49] trade once you take a loss
[31:52] then you have to
[31:54] make back fifty percent
[31:56] of what you lost so in this case if you
[31:58] would have got stopped down here we'll
[32:00] just round it to a hundred dollars with
[32:01] commission
[32:02] you have to make fifty dollars
[32:04] back
[32:05] before you can go back to your full one
[32:06] percent risk
[32:08] and that's it's easy that's easy to do
[32:11] it's not easy to follow this logic so
[32:14] what happens if you take that second
[32:15] trade and risking a half of one percent
[32:17] and that trade gets knocked out to a
[32:19] loss
[32:20] what size you use on your next trade one
[32:22] quarter of one percent
[32:24] and that's obviously the lowest you can
[32:25] go with so
[32:27] you have to determine what your risk is
[32:30] and it's going to obviously reduce the
[32:31] number of trades you can take
[32:35] that's why i tell everyone
[32:37] you know there's a lot of you out here
[32:38] that are starting on a shoestring
[32:40] meaning you don't have a lot of money
[32:42] and you're trying to speculate with live
[32:44] funds with a fifty dollar account
[32:47] or a hundred dollar account and i get it
[32:49] i understand it's hard if you don't come
[32:51] for money if you don't have
[32:53] the resources where you are you know
[32:55] globally
[32:57] it feels like you're out of reach
[33:01] learn the skill set
[33:02] okay i promise you if you learn the
[33:04] skill set
[33:05] you can do funded account type things as
[33:08] a venture or find partners that'll come
[33:10] in with you you don't need the money it
[33:13] doesn't have to be your money you can
[33:15] make a lot of money with other people's
[33:16] money but funded accounts provide a way
[33:19] for you to go in with a very small
[33:20] amount of money
[33:22] and you learn the skills that i'm laying
[33:23] down here in public
[33:25] you can walk right into anyone's funded
[33:27] account challenges okay if you want to
[33:29] call it a challenge
[33:30] and just walk right through it and take
[33:32] it over and then secure whatever size
[33:34] account you're trying to go for
[33:36] and then trade it
[33:38] soberly
[33:40] you aim for 10 a month 15 a month
[33:45] and just make that and stop
[33:48] don't try to push it don't try to get
[33:50] rich real quick you want that 10 to 15 a
[33:53] month
[33:54] coming into your hands after the split
[33:56] that you do with whatever that account
[33:58] is
[33:58] when you're registered with whatever
[34:00] funded account company that's helping
[34:02] you
[34:04] find the scratch to get started
[34:08] but knowing how to manage that drawdown
[34:11] will keep you from going into obviously
[34:13] blowing your account it'll control the
[34:15] equity drawdown it won't be a sharp
[34:17] jagged
[34:18] falling off a cliff it'll be you run up
[34:21] to new equity highs and you have a
[34:22] losing trade which is reasonable
[34:23] everybody has a losing trade you might
[34:24] have a series of losing trades but if
[34:26] you take a one percent loss and then you
[34:28] take another loss at half of one percent
[34:30] you take another loss at a quarter of
[34:32] one percent
[34:34] you're only down one and three quarters
[34:35] percent
[34:38] that's not a lot of drawdown
[34:40] but you've now taken three losing
[34:42] consecutive trades
[34:44] that's easy to come back from
[34:46] versus
[34:47] taking one percent loss
[34:49] then saying okay i'm gonna double up and
[34:50] try to make it back with two percent
[34:52] risk because i don't have to
[34:54] just get half the position movement i
[34:57] took as a loss
[34:58] and then you take a full two percent
[34:59] loss now you're down three percent on
[35:01] two trades then you go and again
[35:03] thinking well i'm gonna do it again with
[35:04] two percent or worse you go higher
[35:06] risking three percent or four percent
[35:09] and then you don't use a stop or you
[35:10] move your stop opening it up with more
[35:12] risk and then suddenly it's very easy to
[35:13] fall into ten percent draw down
[35:16] and then it becomes a psychological
[35:18] wrestling match
[35:19] where now you feel embarrassed you're
[35:21] shamed
[35:23] you feel like you
[35:26] have to have it back otherwise
[35:28] you're a failure
[35:30] when professional money managers
[35:32] they don't care about being in drawdown
[35:35] they care about managing their
[35:36] expectations and the discipline that's
[35:39] required to operate and engage they are
[35:42] not allowed to touch their account when
[35:44] they're highly charged or emotional
[35:47] so that's all part of risk management
[35:49] it's not just the numbers game it's a
[35:51] psychological game too but you have to
[35:52] manage that and
[35:55] quell that whole desire to get right
[35:57] back to where you were before you took
[35:59] that loss
[36:01] that feeling comes
[36:04] because you are an infant in this
[36:06] industry
[36:07] and that's not a knock against you okay
[36:10] it's the truth if you were working with
[36:12] me one-on-one and i was standing in the
[36:14] same room with you i would say it to
[36:16] your face you're an infant if you think
[36:18] like that
[36:19] it's infantile to think that way
[36:22] it's not a rude comment it's the facts
[36:24] because you want to get your toy that
[36:26] was taken from you back right away
[36:30] and you don't need it back right away
[36:33] when you have a loss or if you go
[36:35] through drawdown the professional money
[36:36] management views it as it's a loan that
[36:38] you're going to collect interest on
[36:41] when a bank lends out money is it crying
[36:43] about how it had to give out your
[36:46] down payment for
[36:48] a home
[36:49] or your boat loan
[36:53] or some other purchase that you
[36:55] made a loan with them with are you are
[36:57] they upset about giving you that big
[36:58] lump of money no
[37:01] no
[37:02] are they expecting to get it back right
[37:03] away no
[37:04] no in fact
[37:07] they don't want you to take it and pay
[37:08] it off real quick
[37:10] because that's their business model they
[37:12] want to lend out the money and get as
[37:13] much interest as possible so
[37:16] while we don't want to leave drawdown in
[37:19] long periods out there we look at or at
[37:22] least i look at when i take a loss if i
[37:24] go into drawdown it's just alone i know
[37:26] i know i'm going to get interest on it
[37:29] because my career isn't going to be
[37:31] framed by
[37:32] the last five trades
[37:34] or the last five weeks or the last five
[37:36] months or last five years
[37:38] i have a
[37:40] long-term view
[37:42] and that's the problem with being an
[37:43] infant in this industry
[37:45] it's too easy for you to want to quit
[37:46] because you don't see
[37:48] past
[37:49] what's happened to you right now
[37:51] or what happened to you last week or the
[37:53] last trade and that last trade that one
[37:55] singular event
[37:57] you've made such a monumental experience
[38:00] out of
[38:01] and it's make it or break it every
[38:03] single trade is a make it or break it
[38:05] i've read two people one on twitter and
[38:07] one on the comment section of the videos
[38:10] i have
[38:11] and they're basically saying yeah i
[38:12] think i'm
[38:13] packing in i can't do this
[38:16] and if that's true congratulations you
[38:19] you found where your breaking point is
[38:23] and you're not willing to go any further
[38:24] into that and if you know yourself well
[38:29] godspeed
[38:31] but there's a lot of folks
[38:33] that get frustrated and if you're going
[38:35] to quit you're not going to post it on
[38:36] the internet
[38:38] you're not okay
[38:40] i believe these individuals that do that
[38:42] they just want to be encouraged like
[38:44] don't don't stop me that's it's a cry
[38:46] for help
[38:47] because honestly
[38:49] if i would have had that
[38:50] as a medium when i was coming up
[38:53] i would have went on the internet and
[38:54] said help
[38:56] i'm gonna quit somebody stopped me from
[38:58] quitting i'm gonna walk out the door
[39:00] it's kind of like a relationship when
[39:02] your lady wants to leave she's like i'm
[39:04] leaving you and she really doesn't want
[39:05] to leave she just wants to see what your
[39:07] reaction is going to be
[39:09] as you see her walking towards the door
[39:11] or grabbing a couple things of her
[39:12] clothing if she's going to leave
[39:15] she ain't telling you you're going to
[39:16] come home and her stuff is gone
[39:18] and if you're going to quit this
[39:19] industry you're not going to talk about
[39:21] it you just ain't going to be here
[39:22] anymore
[39:23] so again roll your sleeves up just
[39:25] understand this is what it's like to be
[39:27] a trader
[39:28] you're going to be in periods where it's
[39:29] very difficult
[39:31] and no matter what you do what you
[39:32] follow what i taught you what somebody
[39:34] else taught you whatever worked in the
[39:35] past you are going to encounter losing
[39:38] trades plural
[39:41] you're going to do it wrong you're going
[39:43] to have an expectation in the
[39:44] marketplace it isn't going to pan out
[39:45] like you thought guess what that means
[39:46] you may take a monetary
[39:48] loss
[39:51] and that's a tax on success
[39:53] you have to pay it
[39:55] nobody gets around that nobody gets
[39:57] around it and some of you in here for
[40:00] whatever reason think that you're going
[40:01] to stroll right on in here
[40:04] because you're going to be the exception
[40:05] to the rule and guess what folks i'm
[40:07] promising you
[40:09] you aren't that special
[40:12] if i wasn't that special nobody's
[40:15] exempt from it
[40:16] you all
[40:18] we all
[40:19] every single speculator has to pay their
[40:22] toll and occasionally guess what
[40:26] the ferryman's got his bony hand holding
[40:28] out
[40:29] waiting for you to drop whatever the
[40:31] next sacrifice of your losing trades
[40:34] gonna be and you have control
[40:36] of how bad that's going to be
[40:38] you limit it
[40:40] but you have to do the math
[40:44] and stick to it otherwise if you trade
[40:46] willy-nilly
[40:47] whatever happens i don't really use a
[40:49] hard stop but i know when i want to get
[40:51] out i hate hearing traders say that
[40:53] that's so
[40:55] disappointing to hear because really
[40:56] what that is communicating is you really
[40:58] don't have it together
[41:00] if you don't know where to place a stop
[41:02] loss
[41:04] you really don't know what you're doing
[41:08] you don't
[41:09] so with this model i've removed that
[41:11] guess
[41:12] that
[41:13] mystery
[41:15] your hard stop needs to be placed period
[41:18] if it gets hit it's done you a favor
[41:22] period
[41:25] but if it does you that favor of
[41:26] protecting and limiting risk it's your
[41:29] job
[41:30] as the trader to listen to the analyst
[41:32] next trade it provides
[41:34] you'll have to manage the trade with
[41:36] less risk
[41:37] because you have a task now you have to
[41:39] come out of drawdown
[41:41] no matter what the drawdown is you have
[41:43] to come back incrementally so let's
[41:45] assume you do a two percent risk trade
[41:48] and you lose the full two percent
[41:51] your next trade you could only risk one
[41:53] percent and it would be basically what
[41:54] i'm showing you here with one contract
[41:57] or one limit order
[41:59] not contract it would be
[42:01] the equivalent of if you're doing two
[42:02] percent you would be doing basically
[42:04] four micro lots
[42:06] entering at 37 54 and three quarters
[42:08] hypothetical entry on the demo and your
[42:10] stop loss at 37 45 and three quarters
[42:12] nine points risk across four micro lots
[42:19] twenty dollars per point
[42:23] okay so
[42:24] if you take that full loss at two
[42:26] percent
[42:26] your next trade you can only do what's
[42:29] being shown here
[42:32] one percent risk and you've got to
[42:34] determine where is your trade
[42:36] defined
[42:37] in terms of points or pips if it's 4x
[42:42] how much of a stop loss do you need in
[42:44] this case we're using this factor here
[42:46] okay nine that's the number of points
[42:48] that's required for the stop for this
[42:50] particular trade not every trade is
[42:52] going to require a static nine point
[42:54] stop sometimes you can do a stop
[42:57] you know with five points
[42:59] it's hard i'm not suggesting that you
[43:01] should be trying to do that but other
[43:02] trades are going to require you to do
[43:03] what
[43:05] more than nine
[43:06] might be 10 might be 12 points
[43:11] so you have to consider what that's
[43:14] going to do for you in terms of risk
[43:15] management
[43:17] and eventually
[43:19] you may get to the point where you lose
[43:21] so much in drawdown that you really
[43:22] can't technically do
[43:25] one micro
[43:27] even if you have the margin to cover it
[43:31] so that's why it's important for you to
[43:33] be very diligent about managing your
[43:34] risk
[43:35] and controlling drawdown don't think oh
[43:38] well you know i'm gonna start off with
[43:40] one percent and then once you make a
[43:42] trade and it's easy
[43:44] think well i can do three percent
[43:46] because if i can do three percent risk
[43:47] and i get a multiple
[43:49] of five r
[43:51] hmm
[43:53] i can make 15
[43:55] one trade and what if i do that every
[43:57] day
[43:58] even better
[43:59] what if i do that in the morning session
[44:01] and in the afternoon and if i can do
[44:03] that why not lose sleep and trade london
[44:06] too
[44:07] well that's 45 in one day good grief i
[44:09] could probably quit my job next sunday
[44:14] i did that kind of stuff folks
[44:17] it doesn't work like that
[44:18] doesn't work like that at all
[44:21] so you have to use low threshold
[44:23] objectives
[44:25] and work your way up from that your
[44:26] career is not going to be 10 trades and
[44:28] you made it
[44:31] no
[44:33] longevity
[44:34] controlled risk impeccable risk
[44:37] management
[44:38] that's how you get here that's how you
[44:41] arrive at consistently profitable and
[44:43] losing trades don't mean anything
[44:46] despite anybody watching you if you do
[44:48] it publicly a losing trade is nothing
[44:50] but a tax on success that's it
[44:57] all right stop management this is going
[44:59] to close the mentorship
[45:02] in terms of the teachings and past this
[45:05] video i'll be doing obviously reviews
[45:07] and topical studies when i feel led to
[45:09] do so but as far as the model itself and
[45:11] the mentorship okay for youtube this
[45:14] free
[45:15] series i did
[45:16] this is done and you'll have everything
[45:19] that you need here every i'm confident
[45:21] in saying that what has been
[45:23] provided to you after this discussion
[45:25] here
[45:26] you have enough
[45:27] and obviously the things i taught you on
[45:29] youtube channel and other lessons and
[45:30] maybe other future lessons i make do
[45:33] they'll just be amplifications and help
[45:35] you refine what this has already given
[45:37] you freely
[45:39] but stop management okay when you place
[45:42] your stop loss down here when can you
[45:44] and when do i move my stop-loss well you
[45:47] have to determine where you're getting
[45:49] in at
[45:50] and where you're trying to get as a
[45:51] target so that's your range from 37 54
[45:54] and three-quarters to 37 80 and a
[45:57] quarter so technically 25 and a half
[46:00] points
[46:01] okay so
[46:03] what is that 12 and three quarters
[46:05] points something like that let's round
[46:08] it to 12 and a half points
[46:10] if we see price move 12 and a half half
[46:12] points above the entry point that you
[46:15] entered at if it moves twelve and a half
[46:17] points your stop loss can move 25
[46:20] percent
[46:22] up
[46:23] from where what's 25 of what range
[46:25] where your stop loss is and your entry
[46:27] so split that range in terms of points
[46:30] if this goes up 12 and a half points
[46:33] which would be 50
[46:35] of the expected range
[46:37] then
[46:38] your stop loss can be reduced or trimmed
[46:40] down to
[46:41] 25
[46:43] so it's going to give you that little
[46:44] bit of a cookie that feel good moment
[46:46] you trimmed some of the risk
[46:48] you're not jamming it up up above to
[46:50] break even because you're going to worry
[46:52] about it
[46:52] you're just moving a little bit
[46:55] now when price moves to 75 percent of
[46:57] the expected targeted range and it means
[46:59] from your entry to here if it moves 75
[47:02] of that then the stop goes to break even
[47:07] period
[47:09] there's your systematic movement of your
[47:11] stop-loss
[47:12] you're not jamming it to break even
[47:15] you're not gonna be worried about
[47:16] getting stopped out you're gonna be more
[47:19] likely to be watching does it still keep
[47:20] reaching for your objective
[47:22] do down closed candles keep supporting
[47:24] price does it run below short-term loan
[47:26] and run higher with a lot of energy
[47:28] because it took
[47:29] short-term sales stops out
[47:32] is it dropping down to a fair value gap
[47:33] and re-accumulating and sending another
[47:35] higher price leg higher
[47:38] that's what you're watching that's the
[47:39] things that you're looking for and as
[47:41] long as it's doing those things
[47:43] collectively or individually you are one
[47:46] side
[47:47] that means you're on the right side of
[47:48] the market and keep holding for your
[47:50] position to hit target
[47:53] if you are doing multiple positions say
[47:55] you're doing competition level leverage
[47:58] and for me that's anywhere between the
[47:59] range of
[48:00] three percent to four and a half percent
[48:04] then you're going to be looking to take
[48:06] partials okay and that partial might be
[48:09] you know once it goes 20 points in your
[48:11] favor you have a static number it always
[48:13] hits 15 or 20.
[48:15] once it does that you no matter what
[48:16] you're doing you take something off
[48:18] okay that's something you might want to
[48:19] incorporate in your own trading model as
[48:21] well but that part is for you to
[48:23] determine don't let me give you static
[48:25] rules that
[48:26] are considered
[48:27] you know cast in stone ironclad can't
[48:30] change it you know i hate doing it with
[48:32] my students because it takes away the
[48:35] uniqueness the individualism that you're
[48:38] bringing as the trader to your own model
[48:41] so these are just
[48:42] basic foundational points that i think
[48:46] will serve you well
[48:47] but you're going to obviously evolve and
[48:50] come up with better ways that meet
[48:52] your expectations and also
[48:54] fit your personality okay
[48:57] so i think that's going to be it and i
[48:59] absolutely want to congratulate all of
[49:00] you that if you've gone through every
[49:02] single one of these videos if you've
[49:03] done the work and back testing and
[49:04] looking at things and studying and
[49:06] you're convinced that the pattern's
[49:07] really there
[49:10] kudos to you okay
[49:12] for those that have not got it yet
[49:14] my encouragement is for you to keep
[49:17] doing it
[49:18] and i promise it won't take you long
[49:20] in fact if you just started and you just
[49:23] found this channel
[49:25] i promise you if you give it six months
[49:27] you'll see things that you never saw
[49:29] before but at the end of one full year
[49:31] because it might take some of you to do
[49:33] that
[49:34] you'll have it you'll understand what
[49:35] you're looking for
[49:36] doesn't mean you're going to be trading
[49:37] every single day it doesn't mean you're
[49:38] going to know the bias every single day
[49:40] doesn't mean you're not going to have
[49:40] losing trades it means that you're going
[49:42] to know what you're doing and even
[49:44] though you may have short term hardships
[49:46] with being stopped out or missing moves
[49:48] or reading it wrong
[49:50] you still will have enough faith in this
[49:52] model because you know it will repeat in
[49:55] the future more times than it fails
[49:58] and i'm challenging you to determine
[50:00] whether that statement is true or not
[50:03] until next time
[50:05] good luck and good trade
