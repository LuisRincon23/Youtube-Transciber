[00:05] all right folks welcome back this is
[00:08] episode 29 I'm gonna be doing a brief
[00:11] review of what took place today
[00:14] I obviously executed today I wasn't
[00:17] planning on doing two videos but uh
[00:23] obviously by the comments
[00:25] some people are a little bit confused so
[00:27] I kind of want to bring your attention
[00:28] back too
[00:30] that 12 553 and a quarter level which is
[00:33] the relative equal highs here on NASDAQ
[00:35] so that was kind of like the basis for
[00:39] why I went into the market today Monday
[00:42] the 16th of May
[00:44] 2022.
[00:46] the bullish bias I was looking for this
[00:50] drawing liquidity still for Nasdaq I
[00:52] originally went in looking for a trade
[00:54] in NASDAQ but all right and the s p much
[00:57] like the NASDAQ had a daily swing low
[01:01] and while we didn't have relative equal
[01:03] highs here for s p the bias was in my
[01:08] opinion warranted for at least the
[01:11] beginning of the week looking for a
[01:13] continuation on the outside
[01:15] before I get into it tomorrow which is
[01:18] Tuesday May 17 2022 8 30 in the morning
[01:21] New York local time we have retail sales
[01:23] numbers and then two o'clock in the
[01:25] afternoon New York local time we have
[01:27] the FED chairman speaking so there's
[01:28] going to be all kinds of volatility at
[01:30] two o'clock tomorrow that's the reason
[01:32] why the market was kind of like
[01:33] lethargic today but I wanted to kind of
[01:36] like showcase something so today I kind
[01:38] of like wanted to put a nail in the
[01:40] coffin finally about this whole business
[01:42] about rented in T4 servers okay I'm
[01:45] never going to bring the conversation up
[01:47] again or the topic again I think
[01:48] everyone knows now by seeing what I've
[01:50] done here just in a short span of time
[01:52] if I did this for another five six weeks
[01:55] you could clearly see that it's not
[01:56] impossible for the same things I was
[01:58] doing on Twitter years and years ago
[02:00] okay with mt4 I'm not using mt4 here I
[02:04] can't game this system I'm using live
[02:06] data you're watching the execute it is
[02:09] what it is folks okay now it's paper
[02:11] trading it's demo trading but I do it
[02:13] just to prove that I can read this stuff
[02:16] I'm not trying to beat my chest I'm not
[02:18] trying to brag but I just want to
[02:20] finally put this to bed because it's
[02:22] still
[02:23] you see people talking about all the
[02:24] time when they do that kind of talking
[02:26] you take them back to these videos here
[02:27] you link these videos to them and let
[02:29] them choke on it
[02:32] all right so we have the
[02:35] one minute chart I went right into the
[02:37] one minute chart because we're starting
[02:39] with the bullish bias and at 9 30 we see
[02:43] the market does in fact take out a
[02:44] short-term High it declines I'm not
[02:47] interested in going short
[02:49] it does not give me a pattern anyway
[02:51] notice that there's no fair value Gap
[02:54] Revisited
[02:56] the market creates this
[02:58] relative equal low starts a rally
[03:01] trades up into the afternoon in here
[03:05] I want to see it create a buying
[03:08] opportunity
[03:11] now the logic behind all this is
[03:15] we're in a day before Fed chair
[03:18] speaks
[03:19] so there's going to be very low
[03:21] volatility as a result of that so it's
[03:23] going to be a small range day
[03:25] doesn't mean you can't trade it
[03:27] obviously but it takes a little bit more
[03:30] experience now I'm not saying that you
[03:31] should trade ahead of Fed chair Powell
[03:33] speaking or any future fed chairman
[03:36] because it's going to be a very quiet
[03:38] day usually like this okay and
[03:42] it's important to know when the
[03:44] volatility is likely to occur and when
[03:46] also the volatility is likely to shrink
[03:48] up and get kind of like lethargic
[03:51] if you look at the s p at the top
[03:54] see the drop down relative equal lows
[03:57] and then we have the same similar
[03:59] pattern here but look what NASDAQ was
[04:00] doing
[04:01] see that lower low when s p was saying I
[04:05] don't want to go that low so it was
[04:07] resisting going lower
[04:09] then
[04:11] we retraced higher just like this NASDAQ
[04:14] did but that NASDAQ made a lower low
[04:16] than that of 10 o'clock in the morning
[04:18] while at the same time the s p said no
[04:20] once again I'm not going lower than the
[04:22] low I made at 10 o'clock so we had a
[04:24] Divergence here and here no indicators
[04:27] folks I'm using inter-market
[04:29] relationships and this is what I dub smt
[04:32] smart money technique or smart money
[04:33] tool now
[04:36] the importance of that is I already had
[04:39] a bias that's bullish
[04:41] there was no
[04:42] short trades that were lined up with
[04:45] this model today there was no
[04:48] interest in wanting to be short I want
[04:51] to focus on being long
[04:55] so we're in the one minute chart here
[04:57] and I want you to take a look at what we
[04:58] have framework wise obviously you've
[05:00] probably already seen the short video
[05:01] compressed today
[05:03] but
[05:04] looking at Price action like this yes
[05:05] you can see there is a rally up it
[05:08] breaks the short term low a fair value
[05:10] Gap it trades up into it and breaks down
[05:11] big deal this doesn't fit the criteria
[05:14] because the displacement leg here would
[05:17] require us to see a fair value Gap above
[05:19] 50 of the high and the low the
[05:20] displacement leg and we don't have that
[05:22] so
[05:24] nothing here fits the model for a short
[05:28] but Watch What Happens
[05:29] the market creates a run-on sell stops
[05:32] here
[05:33] then Morales
[05:36] retraces back down into a fair value Gap
[05:40] I've seen this happening but I was
[05:42] trying to get the recording software
[05:44] that I use and by the way let me just
[05:45] throw this in here too because I see
[05:46] people asking
[05:48] my
[05:49] website address as a watermark trading
[05:52] view doesn't do that okay I use my
[05:55] Camtasia
[05:57] recording software that helps me do
[05:59] these videos it's just an application
[06:01] you can overlay like a
[06:04] like a text
[06:06] call out I call it and that's what it is
[06:08] so it's really when I'm doing the
[06:09] recording talking
[06:11] there is nothing here it's a it's a
[06:13] blank chart and then at the end of the
[06:15] recording when I'm editing it I'll just
[06:17] add in my website address and so anyway
[06:19] with that said we've seen the market
[06:21] trade back down in and I was trying to
[06:22] get the Camtasia Studio to open up and
[06:24] sometimes
[06:26] it doesn't open up and give me what I
[06:28] need so I have to close it down entirely
[06:30] and restart it and the whole time this
[06:32] candle was doing its business and I
[06:35] wanted to see it returned into the
[06:37] sphere of a gap once more and I got in
[06:40] on this candle here and
[06:45] we'll look at the relationship between
[06:47] the NASDAQ which was a little bit
[06:49] sloppier
[06:50] in here versus
[06:53] the s p a little bit more structured
[06:55] here
[06:56] so the fair value Gap in here
[06:58] this candle in here it Wicks down into
[07:00] it
[07:01] and I want to get close to this fair
[07:03] value Gap without it running too far
[07:05] away so I kind of like want to touch a
[07:07] little bit tonight with close proximity
[07:09] entries that means
[07:12] you might not get
[07:13] so precise with your entries you might
[07:17] fumble with your
[07:19] order entry or something might happen
[07:21] like it happened with me I I wanted to
[07:23] record me entering not just simply say
[07:25] here here's a trade I took so I wanted
[07:28] to show obviously me getting in putting
[07:30] a stop managing the position and adding
[07:32] the second position in here what do you
[07:34] do in this situation if you miss the
[07:35] ideal entry well as long as you're
[07:37] getting in there really close or like
[07:39] I'm suggesting here a close proximity
[07:41] entry
[07:42] I don't think there's anything wrong
[07:43] with it so if we are looking for
[07:47] entry patterns
[07:49] the idea is we want to get into where
[07:51] our model is suggesting it so we're
[07:54] seeing the market trade lower lower it's
[07:56] failing to make a lower low like NASDAQ
[07:58] and we have
[08:01] this load is probably not going to be
[08:03] taken out because we're bullish
[08:06] the market rallies up we have a
[08:08] short-term shift in Market structure
[08:10] that trades back down into the Fairway
[08:12] Gap look how many opportunities if you
[08:13] go along one
[08:15] two three four five six seven eight
[08:20] eight candles
[08:22] it gave an opportunity to get in this
[08:24] area here
[08:25] either inside the Fairway Gap or in
[08:27] close proximity to it
[08:29] now
[08:32] when the market starts to Rally I have
[08:34] one more indication that the market
[08:36] structure has shifted again bullish with
[08:39] these highs taken out here
[08:41] and then they had a small little Fair
[08:42] bag out there and then you watch me add
[08:45] more the limit order came in filled it I
[08:49] only had one and a half or no I'm sorry
[08:52] one and three quarters
[08:54] handles okay
[08:56] seven ticks if you want to think of it
[08:58] like that at seven ticks of Heat against
[09:01] me on this little candle here
[09:03] before I started running in my favor
[09:06] I took the full pool off here
[09:10] and I did not get the highest high I was
[09:13] a little disappointed in that regard but
[09:16] uh the the candle obviously hit it there
[09:18] and we'll go over to trading View and
[09:21] look at the business all right we're
[09:22] over here on trading view this is
[09:24] live you can see time of this recording
[09:27] this is where I'm sitting down at the
[09:29] computer
[09:30] and the market trades lower creates that
[09:33] short-term run here rallies
[09:35] breaking Market structure to this upside
[09:39] trades into the fair value Gap
[09:41] and the secondary fair value Gap and it
[09:44] runs up into the liquidity above here
[09:47] now if I add
[09:50] the executions
[09:54] I want you to see
[09:57] look right in here and right in here and
[09:59] up here where you'll see the excess and
[10:01] entries respectively
[10:03] so you can see there's that candle that
[10:07] entry
[10:08] 3994 and a half
[10:14] 3996 and a quarter
[10:17] and it went down to 94.
[10:20] what's the low here yeah 94 and a half
[10:22] so it was only
[10:25] less than two handles
[10:27] Heat against me before I started relying
[10:29] there
[10:30] this one 399 450
[10:34] was right in here and the low on this
[10:38] candle
[10:39] 93 in a quarter so
[10:45] one and a quarter no less than one
[10:50] yeah one less than one handle of heat
[10:53] entering on this candle here and the
[10:55] next candle had a little bit of
[10:56] retracement so very very very tight
[11:00] placement and this was not entering in
[11:03] the fair value Gap it was in close
[11:04] proximity to it so the underlying idea
[11:08] was it was going down in here to go
[11:10] higher retrace into that to go higher
[11:12] and you saw me map out all this stuff
[11:15] here and call it up in you know business
[11:17] is done but
[11:20] the exit up here 4022 and a half and
[11:25] that's that you can see there is no
[11:27] short positions in here no short
[11:30] positions over here on that business and
[11:33] on NASDAQ we'll pull that up to sort of
[11:35] completeness sake too
[11:37] [Music]
[11:43] okay and
[11:52] no
[11:55] executions
[11:59] here see
[12:03] so all the business was done in
[12:05] the s p today
[12:07] so my question to you is when you see
[12:10] these
[12:11] videos and
[12:14] I'm trying to illustrate obviously that
[12:17] I don't need to fraud anyone
[12:20] the things I'm teaching you
[12:21] I think that you're seeing evidence that
[12:24] it works
[12:25] hopefully you guys have seen enough with
[12:28] this here
[12:31] um
[12:31] do the math folks okay
[12:34] in
[12:36] less than a week and a half
[12:39] how much more would you see this
[12:41] compound if I did it for six more weeks
[12:44] or five weeks
[12:46] is it hard to imagine
[12:49] the things that I did on Twitter with
[12:51] mt4 not a rental nt4 server
[12:54] literally pushing a button putting the
[12:56] orders in doing the whole business okay
[12:58] I know a lot of you have just discovered
[13:01] me and you're seeing people post stuff
[13:03] about how other Traders or other mentors
[13:06] or other teachers
[13:08] they fake their positions I'm open about
[13:11] paper trading because it's compliance
[13:14] I'm not legally allowed to give you
[13:15] trade advice
[13:16] so I'm protected
[13:19] by my
[13:21] discussion in paper trading because you
[13:24] cannot make money with paper trades and
[13:25] you can't lose money with paper trades
[13:27] but I've always said this from the
[13:29] beginning I've dubbed myself the demo
[13:31] baller
[13:32] I championed that Meme because
[13:35] I want to make sure everyone knows that
[13:38] I'm not promising you profitability I
[13:40] don't dangle a care in front of you and
[13:41] saying you're going to do what I'm doing
[13:42] here because you're not going to be able
[13:44] to replicate this you're not okay don't
[13:47] be deceived by seeing me do this again
[13:50] for like the fifth time
[13:52] running up an account like this would
[13:55] Breakneck speed velocity
[13:58] and this is just casually dealing in a
[14:01] tight range when there's large ranges I
[14:04] could have easily taken this over to a
[14:05] million dollars
[14:07] already
[14:09] but it doesn't prove anything except for
[14:12] the fact that I can read price action
[14:14] that's all that's all I'm showcasing I'm
[14:16] not trying to say I'm the best I'm not
[14:19] trying to say that you can't make money
[14:21] in other things I'm just saying
[14:24] I know how to read these candlesticks I
[14:26] know what they're likely to do most of
[14:28] the time before they do it not all the
[14:30] time I take losing trades
[14:32] but when it's really
[14:34] likely to work with the algorithm
[14:38] I'll be dialed in
[14:40] you can't fake what I'm doing you can
[14:43] see me executing the trade you can see
[14:45] me managing the trade you can see the
[14:47] orders entering and filling they pop up
[14:50] they verify the whole thing no replay
[14:52] button up here
[14:54] none of this stuff okay see how that's
[14:56] blue now
[14:58] like you can't create that same scenario
[15:01] so I'm hopefully satisfying
[15:05] this discussion that people like to
[15:07] bring up all the time about rented mt4
[15:09] servers because like that they couldn't
[15:11] wait to put that on me because they
[15:13] watched me do just like this and I ran
[15:15] up to five million dollars in a little
[15:17] less than one and a half months
[15:19] Okay so
[15:21] I understand that doesn't seem possible
[15:24] I understand that
[15:28] people that would be able to do what I'm
[15:30] doing could very easily go out there and
[15:33] defraud people I'm telling you it's demo
[15:36] I'm not saying that I did that with real
[15:38] money I'm just saying that I can read
[15:40] price action I can see these patterns
[15:43] forming and even with these other folks
[15:45] out there with fake mt4 servers and mt4
[15:48] screenshots of making money and all this
[15:50] other fake withdrawals on I made fun of
[15:53] all that stuff
[15:54] I trolled those people on Twitter
[15:57] now I'm about to go back to Twitter
[16:00] this time
[16:01] I'm not going there with that intent
[16:04] I'm ready should someone want to bring
[16:06] it but I'm not there or going there for
[16:09] that reason the reason why I'm going to
[16:10] Twitter is I miss being able to do my
[16:12] small little vignettes where I would do
[16:15] recordings of me either taking a trade
[16:17] or reading price action and having some
[16:19] short little clip 40 seconds long or
[16:21] less of Music in the background I miss
[16:24] doing that maybe it wasn't always your
[16:26] cup of tea for my music choice but I
[16:28] have a very diverse palette for music
[16:30] and it's just one of those things I
[16:32] enjoy doing so
[16:34] it might not be
[16:36] worth it for you to follow me on Twitter
[16:39] or it might be I don't know but
[16:42] I kind of wanted to clear the air for
[16:45] the last time and show you all one more
[16:47] time where I don't need to do
[16:50] what fraud to do like I can I can see
[16:53] this stuff before it happens and you can
[16:56] learn how to do this too
[16:58] you can read it before it happens you
[17:00] can see it you can have faith that the
[17:03] things that you're learning here are
[17:04] rooted on Sound Logic it's not
[17:08] randomness
[17:09] it's not retail logic these are things
[17:12] that are algorithmic and I think today
[17:15] was a testimony to that so
[17:19] tomorrow's going to be very volatile be
[17:20] careful do not try to trade tomorrow
[17:22] you'll probably hurt yourself if you do
[17:26] or don't listen to me and learn the
[17:28] lesson the hard way
[17:30] until talk to you next time
[17:31] be safe
