[00:09] s p 500 june contract 2022
[00:13] this is our daily chart and before i get
[00:15] into it just let me remind you that i do
[00:16] not use whatsapp i'm not going to be in
[00:18] the comments section asking you to reach
[00:20] out to me okay hit me up
[00:22] uh let's talk none of that stuff that's

[00:26] you for money i'm not going to direct
[00:28] message you i'm not going to direct
[00:29] message you on twitter okay all those
[00:31] people are just trying to scam you try
[00:33] to pretend to be me i'm not asking for
[00:35] your money you're here to eat off my
[00:36] table for free and i'm happy to do it so
[00:39] just know that those accounts are not me
[00:42] please report them and ignore them
[00:44] all right so
[00:46] the s p 500 daily chart
[00:48] we're going to look at this day here
[00:50] and before we get into it i'm going to
[00:53] bring your attention to the 16th of may
[00:56] on that low
[00:57] this morning on twitter i was not able
[00:59] to participate in the early session
[01:01] movement on the stock indices
[01:03] because i've been trying to do things to
[01:05] share with the audience that has
[01:08] been mainly following me because of
[01:10] forex
[01:11] i noticed a lot of you are starting to
[01:13] evaluate and complain that you want to
[01:14] see 4x and i understand that but even my
[01:17] paid membership group
[01:18] they have seen very little in terms of
[01:20] forex too
[01:22] and i'm pushing this asset class because
[01:24] this is where the volatility is price is
[01:26] price it doesn't make a difference when
[01:27] forex starts moving around big again
[01:29] trust me index futures will get you know
[01:31] slower and quiet
[01:33] in comparison to forex trust me when i
[01:35] tell you the currency markets will
[01:37] eventually
[01:38] within the next 12 months or so probably
[01:41] start having some pretty wild movement
[01:43] but until then we have to look for
[01:45] volatility where we can find it right
[01:46] now is in the stock index market
[01:49] so
[01:50] if you're a hardliner if you're a purist
[01:52] and you don't want to see these types of
[01:53] moves in
[01:55] this type of market i understand but
[01:57] learn from it because it works the same
[01:59] way in forex just
[02:01] know that okay
[02:03] so
[02:04] i mentioned on twitter that i was in the
[02:06] dollar cad this morning i went along on
[02:07] that one on its
[02:09] impact news at 8 30 and it was a snooze
[02:12] fest it took forever just to move a
[02:14] little bit
[02:15] obviously i shared that on the twitter
[02:17] feed so you can again go and look at
[02:19] that
[02:20] so i mentioned i was going to grab a
[02:22] bite to eat have some lunch and then i
[02:23] would look to see if there's anything
[02:25] for
[02:26] the stock in the sea market
[02:28] and i participated in this
[02:30] move i'm going to show you today here
[02:32] and i hinted at where the market was
[02:34] likely to go to and let me state this
[02:36] going forward because i had perry mason
[02:39] over there on twitter reach out to me
[02:41] saying that the bar has been lowered
[02:44] for calling out trades i don't call out
[02:47] trades i don't i'm not going to put you
[02:48] in a trade i'm not going to give you an
[02:50] entry a stop a target i'm not going to
[02:52] do that i don't spoon feed i don't do
[02:53] that with my paid group what i do is i
[02:55] point to where the market's going to go
[02:56] i've already taught you how to get in
[02:58] i've already taught you where to put a
[02:59] stop loss i've already taught you how to
[03:00] put your limit orders in i taught you
[03:02] all that now the problem is you don't
[03:04] have the experience of knowing where
[03:05] it's going to likely go next so this
[03:07] morning what i did was i drew everyone's
[03:09] attention to the low on the 16th of may
[03:11] 2022
[03:13] now if the market is above and let's go
[03:15] into a lower timeframe chart
[03:19] okay
[03:19] and
[03:21] if we're in the market
[03:23] and we're up here
[03:25] and i'm suggesting to everyone think
[03:27] about this low over here on the 16th
[03:30] what do you think i'm drawing your
[03:31] attention to while we're up here and i'm
[03:33] drawing your attention to this specific
[03:35] area the lows of may 16 2022.
[03:39] do you think i'm referring to it as it
[03:40] should not come back down here
[03:43] no everyone should understand my style
[03:45] is we're aiming for liquidity so if it's
[03:48] up here
[03:49] and i'm pointing down here and taking
[03:51] your attention down there i'm acting
[03:53] like a scout
[03:54] you're the sniper in training whether
[03:56] you realize or not okay
[03:58] so i'm trying to point you to where you
[04:00] should be aiming
[04:02] and you have to do the work of scoping
[04:04] it up
[04:05] pulling the trigger
[04:07] and dealing with all that okay so
[04:10] there's no shortcut to this there's not
[04:12] going to be an ict on twitter or on
[04:14] youtube that sits down in front of you
[04:16] and says okay
[04:17] everybody are you ready we're all going
[04:18] to buy right now we're all going to put
[04:20] our stop-loss at the same place we're
[04:22] all going to put our exit or the same
[04:23] place and we're all going to ride these
[04:25] things and this is going to be happy and
[04:27] that's it
[04:28] i'm not gonna do that i never promised
[04:30] to do that i'm not gonna do a period in
[04:31] a story no way this is how i train my
[04:33] students it works folks it does not work
[04:35] for lazy people okay i understand that
[04:38] some of you just want to be handheld but
[04:39] that's not gonna happen with me i don't
[04:41] do it i didn't do it when people paid me
[04:43] and i'm not gonna do it for free either
[04:44] so you don't need
[04:46] me to hold your hand if i point to where
[04:48] i think the market's gonna go
[04:50] it's your job to study and look for the
[04:52] opportunity the fair value gap is what
[04:53] you're gonna be utilizing okay
[04:55] some of you are
[04:56] fixated on only looking for the setup at
[04:59] the opening
[05:00] well what happens if you don't get a
[05:01] trade at the opening can't you use a
[05:03] fair bag you have to get involved with
[05:04] the move if it's going to go down to
[05:05] something like this
[05:07] yes that's what i did today so let me
[05:10] add the annotations in the form of
[05:12] showing you the executions so you can
[05:14] see i'm not sure why this thing is not
[05:15] popping up stay on there there you go
[05:19] all right so here's where i
[05:21] entered i did four contracts at four
[05:24] thousand seven and three quarters
[05:26] aiming for the sixteenths
[05:28] low i didn't have a whole lot of time to
[05:30] be babysitting this thing and
[05:32] late afternoon this could have easily
[05:34] whipped up did some kind of a
[05:36] retracement if i didn't kind of stop
[05:37] loss trail down and then even move lower
[05:40] so just to make it easy short and sweet
[05:42] to the point
[05:43] your attention was drawn to the 16th the
[05:45] low on the 16th of may let's go into a
[05:48] 15 minute time frame
[05:53] all right so you can see
[05:54] up close candle what do you think that
[05:56] is right before we start to go to lower
[05:57] it's a bearish order block draw that out
[05:59] in time it hits that order block on this
[06:01] candle here
[06:03] dropping into a
[06:04] five-minute chart
[06:08] what is this
[06:22] doesn't look like a fair guy yet until
[06:23] you zoom in huh
[06:25] so right in here it's hitting
[06:29] it overshoots it granted but it's a lot
[06:31] of volatility right now
[06:33] this candle is high your stop would be
[06:35] above there
[06:37] hold on to
[06:39] the position until it starts to break
[06:41] lower
[06:43] if you want to fine tune it
[06:54] this is the one i shared on
[06:58] twitter in the recording
[07:02] so what i saw was this fairway gap here
[07:04] it hit it
[07:05] created what what is this what's this
[07:07] pattern here what's these three candles
[07:09] here
[07:10] it's a swing high
[07:12] so as soon as this candle closed here
[07:14] i'm gonna go right here at this candle
[07:16] and just get in and go short
[07:18] trusting the fact that we've already had
[07:19] a fair value gap we already went through
[07:21] it we have it swing high and it's
[07:23] bearish i'm looking for what
[07:26] what am i looking for i'm looking for a
[07:28] run below this old low which is may 16
[07:30] 2022 is low
[07:32] so entering here
[07:34] and i'm writing it out
[07:36] with a stop here
[07:37] everything is
[07:39] reduced in terms of risk
[07:41] as soon as we started to break lower
[07:42] here and started moving my favor
[07:44] aggressively i moved my stop only
[07:46] because the volatility is so high right
[07:47] now
[07:48] i just don't want to see it come back
[07:49] and knock me out
[07:51] that's not fear that's just sound money
[07:54] management i'm not trying to take a
[07:55] losing trade so here is the entry again
[08:00] it delivers on the downside i took my
[08:02] first partial here
[08:05] one off here
[08:07] and in the limit order you watch that
[08:08] fill on the little recording the
[08:10] vignette that i shared on twitter
[08:13] ultimately we started going
[08:16] a little bit sideways going into the
[08:18] beginning of lunch
[08:20] in new york here's your typical lunch
[08:23] time consolidation
[08:25] and then
[08:26] what's this
[08:28] stops
[08:29] ahead of
[08:31] lunch
[08:32] very valuable
[08:40] it's almost like uh it knows what it
[08:42] wants to do huh
[08:44] breaks lower
[08:45] consolidation again
[08:48] trades lower
[08:49] consolidation bumps to stops here
[08:53] what's this
[08:57] oh this ict just makes it so complicated
[09:01] hits it sells off
[09:04] sell side here
[09:06] consolidates one more time
[09:08] and trades and meets the low of the day
[09:10] i think when this one huh
[09:12] closed candle though
[09:14] at 39 10 not bad
[09:16] so
[09:18] that is what i did today i did not
[09:20] participate in the afternoon session
[09:22] post new york lunch
[09:25] this is all i had to share today
[09:28] right there
[09:31] there
[09:33] there
[09:34] and there okay that's gonna be it for
[09:36] today hope you enjoyed this and found it
[09:38] insightful until i'll talk to you
