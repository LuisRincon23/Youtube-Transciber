[00:05] all right folks welcome back this is
[00:06] episode number 10 of the 2022 ICT
[00:09] mentorship for the YouTube channel this
[00:12] lecture is going to be teaching
[00:13] implementing economic calendar events
[00:15] with the
[00:19] open all right so the economic calendar
[00:21] many of you probably don't even consider
[00:22] looking at this but it's important if
[00:24] you're going to be learning how to
[00:26] speculate study these markets certainly
[00:29] if you're ever going to consider putting
[00:30] live funds
[00:31] in you really want to know what this
[00:33] calendar says for the day you're going
[00:34] to be trading otherwise you could be
[00:37] surprised unfortunately adversely with a
[00:41] sudden Rush of volatility that you
[00:44] wouldn't otherwise
[00:46] expect this is Thursday's economic
[00:49] calendar for Thursday February
[00:51] 17th and not all of these things are
[00:54] going to be Heavy Hitters for stock
[00:57] indices
[00:58] but most of them are and what I'm
[01:02] showing here is what I teach all my
[01:04] students I go to forexfactory.com I use
[01:06] their economic calendar it's not the
[01:08] only one you can use it's whatever you
[01:10] like I like the color scheme they use
[01:13] it's just a personal preference you can
[01:15] pick any economic calendar they're all
[01:17] going to pretty much say the same
[01:19] thing
[01:21] here the medium impact events are like
[01:24] orange low impact are yellow and
[01:27] anything that's red which is not being
[01:29] shown here here would be like a high
[01:32] impact news
[01:33] driver so when we look at these stock
[01:36] indices the reason why I teach you 8:30
[01:38] in the morning like that's your
[01:40] beginning time to start looking at or
[01:42] crosshairs time the news embargo lifts
[01:45] at this time at 8:30 typically there's a
[01:47] bunch of news events that are being
[01:49] ushered into the marketplace at that
[01:52] time now some of these reports or
[01:56] speeches or data points they may may
[02:00] be used as a smokees screen they may be
[02:05] used as a catalyst to have price go up
[02:09] or down at the time of their
[02:11] release other instances like I'm going
[02:13] to teach tonight usually there's going
[02:16] to
[02:16] be a
[02:18] buildup or a dropping down in price
[02:21] right before the report comes out and
[02:23] then the real move starts to ensue okay
[02:27] so it'll make more sense as I get into
[02:30] the actual
[02:32] teachings okay so we're looking at the
[02:34] NASDAQ daily chart this is the trading
[02:38] view continuous charts that way you'll
[02:41] know what I'm looking at here it's the
[02:42] one we've been working with in this
[02:44] mentorship so the daily chart when I'm
[02:47] talking about power three a lot of
[02:49] comments came in the previous video
[02:52] mentioning how it was confusing to them
[02:54] because obviously they're they're new
[02:56] they just found me they don't know what
[02:57] I'm talking about when I say power three
[02:59] I actually have a teaching in the
[03:01] YouTube channel so you can look it up
[03:03] and study it but I'll give you a little
[03:06] bit more amplification here also kind of
[03:08] like help bridge the gaps in your
[03:10] understanding about daily bias because
[03:12] if I could tell
[03:14] you what was the most
[03:17] requested
[03:18] question over the years since I've been
[03:21] mentoring people without a doubt
[03:24] absolutely without a doubt the number
[03:26] one question I get is ICT can you please
[03:29] teach me the daily bias can you tell me
[03:32] if it's going to be an up day or a down
[03:34] day and I'm going to teach you
[03:36] here and this is my honest to God's
[03:39] truth okay I'm never going to be able to
[03:41] do it any easier than this okay you just
[03:44] have to study price action and you'll
[03:45] see it for yourself after a while but
[03:47] this is really all I teach my students
[03:49] and it is nothing more secret to it it's
[03:54] this is it okay it's just the brass tax
[03:55] of looking at what the daily range is
[03:57] likely to form so right away we're at
[04:00] the daily chart and as I mentioned in
[04:02] the previous episode I outlined this
[04:05] High here and this low and that was the
[04:07] range we were within and the 50 level
[04:09] was equilibrium so again above
[04:11] equilibrium is what the premium market
[04:15] and Below 50% is a discount market so we
[04:18] traded back up into the top end of the
[04:22] range between this low and this high and
[04:25] between these two levels here remember I
[04:27] gave you this low and this High that's
[04:29] that's a imbalance okay it's a fair
[04:32] value
[04:33] Gap this Market was down in a discount
[04:36] initially after we had the indecisive
[04:38] candle go back and watch the ninth
[04:41] episode you haven't watched that one yet
[04:43] and you're watching this one it's going
[04:45] to feel like even more
[04:47] confusion but we had an indecisive
[04:49] candle here and we were in a discount
[04:51] even though I believe and I've been
[04:53] telling my own students that I believe
[04:54] we're going to clean out these lows down
[04:56] here we went to a discount relative to
[05:00] the dealing range between this high and
[05:02] that low so below it we're at discount
[05:06] and we have an imbalance so it's likely
[05:08] to do what go back up and rebalance this
[05:10] before going back
[05:12] down listen to what I said in the
[05:14] episode number nine I said even
[05:17] if we trade back up into this range
[05:20] there's trades you can take even if we
[05:22] believe that it's going to go below
[05:23] those
[05:25] lows that's me tipping my hand to you
[05:29] I'm not trying to provide you signals
[05:31] I'm not going to tell you Buy Here Sell
[05:32] Here put your stop here take your I'm
[05:34] not I'm not doing that in the community
[05:37] tab on my YouTube
[05:38] channel probably once a week I'm going
[05:41] to point out something in the chart
[05:43] right before it happens and I want you
[05:46] to try to study
[05:48] it you may not be able to see it real
[05:50] time you may miss it come to the YouTube
[05:52] channel after work or
[05:54] whatever maybe you're sleeping and you
[05:56] couldn't see it at the time but still go
[05:59] through your charts using the
[06:00] information I'm providing you I get
[06:03] asked all the time can you please put a
[06:05] date and time reference in the post I
[06:08] forget I I try to remember doing it when
[06:12] I wake up if I'm going to post
[06:14] anything but something happens and I see
[06:16] in the chart and I Hur most I want to
[06:17] put everything in the post and I I
[06:19] forgot it so I apologize for that it's a
[06:22] work in progress folks so if we look at
[06:27] the reference points of it being in a
[06:29] premium Market or a discount Market but
[06:31] then we have this imbalance and we have
[06:33] a bias that and it's likely to go down
[06:35] and take out these lows so what have we
[06:38] said here in short the Market's been
[06:40] going lower yes we took out some sell
[06:43] stops below this low with the sell side
[06:45] liquidity being taken out here then a
[06:48] natural retracement which is reasonable
[06:50] then we start the decline then we come
[06:52] back up one more time failure swing
[06:54] doesn't go above that high and then it
[06:56] breaks down and it creates an imbalance
[06:57] when it takes out this shortterm
[07:00] low wow that's kind of like the model
[07:03] I'm teaching you yes now what's the
[07:06] framework here we rallied broke below a
[07:10] short-term low with the model suggesting
[07:14] that these lows may be taken out so any
[07:17] Rally or up Clos candle or
[07:19] candles should be viewed as a potential
[07:22] shorting
[07:24] candidate now ring in the imbalance
[07:29] we traded up into the imbalance one more
[07:31] day we swept above it not by
[07:34] much then the next day we open we rall
[07:38] just a little bit and then
[07:42] plunge we took out the previous day low
[07:45] and the day before it's low so both of
[07:46] these daily lows have been cleaned out
[07:49] now this one is the next
[07:51] one then down
[07:54] here so when I talk about power three
[07:59] I'm specifically dealing with this time
[08:02] frame the daily
[08:03] chart if you consider where the Market
[08:06] opens say this is the opening price in
[08:09] the daily range if you're expecting it
[08:11] to go down or maybe you weren't
[08:12] expecting it to go down you just looking
[08:13] at the price in your chart and you see
[08:15] that the open was here it rallied a
[08:17] little bit then it went down and then
[08:19] closed near the low now that's a rather
[08:24] simplistic overview just making it very
[08:27] plain nothing terribly exciting about
[08:30] that but when you really start to
[08:32] consider it it is really exciting
[08:34] because this is the market right here if
[08:37] you understand this and you can study a
[08:40] daily chart daily bias will become
[08:43] easier for you if you start implementing
[08:46] it with this mindset so if we're bearish
[08:51] okay if we're bearish on a market we're
[08:53] going to anticipate the daily ranges or
[08:56] each one of these candles doing this
[08:58] very thing here open a rally not much of
[09:02] a rally but it can make a large Wick it
[09:05] doesn't make a difference but the
[09:06] general premise is it goes up just to go
[09:09] down and it closes down near its low
[09:11] when it's bearish obviously this would
[09:14] be reversed where the open would be down
[09:16] here near the low and the close would be
[09:18] near the high of the daily candle if
[09:20] it's bullish but not every single candle
[09:23] in a series of the entire price swing is
[09:26] going to be all up closed candles when
[09:28] you're bullish
[09:29] conversely not every candle is going to
[09:32] be a down closed candle when you're
[09:35] bearish but I've already taught you when
[09:38] you have these sustained price swings on
[09:39] the higher time frame you're not seeing
[09:41] a lot of up closed candles when it's
[09:43] bearish and you're not seeing a lot of
[09:45] down Clos candles when it's
[09:47] bullish but contrast that with what you
[09:50] may be feeling when you're looking at
[09:52] price you'll make a big deal out of one
[09:56] down day when you've been bullish and it
[09:58] completely takes you out of your game oh
[10:00] I can't determine bias I don't know
[10:01] what's going on this is always tricking
[10:04] me I felt that too in the 90s I know
[10:07] what it feels like but let's take a
[10:09] closer look at
[10:11] this this is the chart that I used to
[10:14] trade back in
[10:16] 1992 the classic open high low and close
[10:19] bar which is what I'm showing you here
[10:22] now with this chart it made perfect
[10:25] sense to me and if my eyes were not as
[10:29] poor Poe as they are now because I'm I'm
[10:31] aging and I've been looking at computer
[10:32] screens for 30 plus years now it's warm
[10:37] them down so obviously candlesticks are
[10:40] a much more preferred way of looking at
[10:43] it because it's thicker you can see the
[10:45] the open and close relationship as I'm
[10:47] teaching you here a lot easier versus
[10:49] this you have to strain to see where the
[10:52] open is on this candle is to the left of
[10:54] the cand or not it's not even a candle
[10:56] it's a bar so to the left of the bar is
[10:58] the open it trades down creates the low
[11:01] rallies up and closes near the high see
[11:04] that same thing here it opens trades
[11:07] down goes up and closes above the
[11:10] opening but in the upper portion of the
[11:12] daily range then we have a high where it
[11:15] doesn't really matter where it closes
[11:17] then it's likely to do what come back
[11:18] and rebalance this it'll make sense in a
[11:22] moment it opens here small little rally
[11:25] up creates this very thing here on this
[11:28] day it opens small little rally up and
[11:30] then down overlapping this daily
[11:35] bar if we look at this relationship over
[11:39] here we have this one single pass with
[11:43] that bar range between this candle's low
[11:45] and this candle's High that's our fair
[11:47] value
[11:48] Gap the market can trade back up into it
[11:51] and look where it closes right on the
[11:52] highs in the next candle it's back and
[11:55] forth works both sides of the range but
[11:59] what is our bias what did I hint at the
[12:02] bias is bearish we're looking for these
[12:04] lows to be taken out so the only thing
[12:06] we were doing was coming back up to
[12:08] rebalance this then go
[12:09] lower so once we went back to the top of
[12:12] the range did this candle or bar touch
[12:15] this candle or bars low no just fell
[12:19] short of
[12:20] it
[12:22] this wiped back and forth so now this
[12:25] range here is completely balanced so
[12:27] there's no reason for this price to hang
[12:29] around now it could have went a little
[12:31] bit higher today and I was waiting for
[12:33] that to potentially happen but I've not
[12:35] abandoned my bearishness for price to go
[12:38] down here all my students know
[12:40] that this movement here we have the open
[12:44] the rally up fade it comes back down and
[12:47] closes on the low that's this pattern
[12:49] right here power three is accumulation
[12:54] manipulation distribution okay that's
[12:56] the three components the power asset ECT
[12:59] is if you understand those relationships
[13:02] on what the daily range is doing the
[13:05] open on a day that's bearish okay the
[13:08] open and anything above it that is
[13:11] accumulation of
[13:13] shorts now it's not limited to just open
[13:16] and above that's the that's where smart
[13:18] money and people like myself and my
[13:20] students that's where we're aiming to
[13:21] enter good and
[13:23] short it can be whatever the range is
[13:26] this is important because my students
[13:27] are actually going to smile when they
[13:28] get this is
[13:30] too the open to the high whatever that
[13:33] range is you take that range and you
[13:36] subtract it from the opening price that
[13:38] is your opening
[13:39] range that's where your fair value gaps
[13:43] that's where your stop raids are going
[13:45] to happen that's where optimal trade
[13:47] entry is going to happen every potential
[13:49] shorting
[13:51] candidate whatever system approach that
[13:53] I teach even in my paid
[13:55] mentorship every premium array okay okay
[13:59] that's what I teach it as every single
[14:01] one of them will reside and form in the
[14:04] range between the open and its high in
[14:06] other words if you're watching price and
[14:08] you're bearish the day opens up and then
[14:10] it rallies up that's a Judah swing the
[14:12] range from the opening price up to that
[14:14] high that range is what you project
[14:16] below the opening price that is your
[14:19] opening range when I say opening range
[14:22] that's opening range so what that does
[14:25] is gives me
[14:28] a an area at which to bracket out how
[14:32] much leeway I can give the market when
[14:34] it starts to go below the opening price
[14:37] and still take a favorable entry because
[14:40] power three is I'm bearish I'm expecting
[14:43] the market to open and rally above if I
[14:45] can get something on short there that's
[14:47] the ideal scenario but I may not be able
[14:49] to do it or I may take a trade early or
[14:52] just take a trade and I get stopped out
[14:53] it's going to happen but then it breaks
[14:55] down below the opening price does that
[14:57] completely ruin the day for me sometimes
[14:58] it it'll just tear off and I can't catch
[15:00] it doesn't give me a setup and I just
[15:02] miss it and you can't chase it and don't
[15:04] worry about it but don't be upset go
[15:07] back in your back testing and you'll see
[15:09] that there's lots of opportunities
[15:10] coming in just below the opening price
[15:13] this is called close proximity entries
[15:16] this is what I promised in this
[15:17] mentorship on YouTube teaching you in
[15:20] the mentorship
[15:21] community I already know most of you
[15:24] that have recently found me and there's
[15:26] been a lot of you that just came on I
[15:27] appreciate all of you joining me
[15:29] but you don't know all the things that
[15:31] I've been teaching on this YouTube
[15:33] channel so you feel like you're drinking
[15:36] from a fire hose right now and it can
[15:38] feel like it's tearing your face off
[15:39] because it's so much information all at
[15:40] one time and leaves your head spinning
[15:43] like this guy keeps talking I don't
[15:44] understand get to the point the point is
[15:45] you need to have layered understanding
[15:48] and if you're not going to be patient
[15:50] and go through the content properly I'm
[15:52] not going to help you I'm going to
[15:53] frustrate you and you'll probably come
[15:55] back to me later on and then learn
[15:57] properly and wish you would have stayed
[15:58] in did it the right way the first time
[16:00] but that's for you to determine on your
[16:03] own having the opening
[16:06] range when you're bearish whatever the
[16:09] high is from the opening project that
[16:11] down your cell setups are going to form
[16:13] in that that is accumulation of
[16:17] shorts the manipulation is the initial
[16:20] rally up that's the sucker play that's
[16:22] typically the breakout artist thinking
[16:24] oh it's going to go higher no it only
[16:27] goes up just to go down that that's a
[16:28] fake run then it goes lower creates the
[16:33] low of the day and then closes near the
[16:36] low of the day so between where the low
[16:38] of the day is and where it closes that's
[16:40] distribution what's being
[16:42] distributed smart monies short positions
[16:46] so they're selling at the open and above
[16:48] or just below
[16:51] it riding out the daily range when it
[16:54] creates the low of the day how do you
[16:56] know when the low of the day is formed
[16:57] well I've taught you
[16:59] time references so if price has been
[17:02] really taking a a beating going lower
[17:05] and you're getting towards the end of
[17:06] the day like 330 you know 345 something
[17:09] like that it's probably really close to
[17:11] the low not all the time sometimes it
[17:13] creates a real fast sudden continuation
[17:16] and if you're not expecting it or if
[17:17] you're offside it can be bad but if it's
[17:20] on side it's really fun to be a part of
[17:22] that but generally it's the last portion
[17:24] of the trading day and it'll create some
[17:27] kind of a low and then wherever it
[17:28] closes between that low and where it
[17:30] closes that's where the distribution
[17:32] cycle is occurring that part is not that
[17:35] important the main thing is
[17:37] understanding what does this candle have
[17:40] the highest probability in terms of
[17:41] forming an open rally sell off and close
[17:44] down on its low or is it likely to
[17:47] create an opening trade lower first then
[17:50] rally and close near the highs take the
[17:52] let's take the close out okay I don't
[17:54] want you thinking you have to know or be
[17:56] able to predict the closing price that's
[17:59] more advanced you don't even need that
[18:00] to be profitable you just need to know
[18:03] is this daily range more likely to
[18:04] expand higher or lower than the opening
[18:07] price that's it that's all you have to
[18:09] do that's the key to bias now how do you
[18:13] know what the bias is going to be most
[18:16] likely not everyday bias most likely
[18:20] what's the bias going to be well let's
[18:21] go back to this low over
[18:23] here it creates a swing low that means a
[18:25] low with a higher low to the right of it
[18:27] and a higher low to the left of it so
[18:29] it's three candles that make up a swing
[18:31] low you do not need a Williams fractal
[18:33] that's way too many candles and you've
[18:35] missed the move okay you don't need that
[18:37] no disrespect for the gentleman but
[18:39] that's nonsense you don't need that okay
[18:42] you only need three candles once you get
[18:44] a swing low or swing high and you have
[18:45] the proper context and you know what
[18:47] you're looking for that's it you go in
[18:48] there you start hunting it now watch
[18:50] what
[18:51] happens we have a swing low form the
[18:54] very next candle we have an opening it
[18:57] trades way down and then comes back up
[18:59] and closes right near the highs is that
[19:02] the opposite of this
[19:04] candle yeah but it's got a whole lot of
[19:08] movement below the opening price so
[19:10] something just took place down
[19:12] here after this swing low was formed did
[19:15] this candle or bar go lower than that
[19:17] one no I promise I'm going to switch the
[19:20] candles but I just want to show you from
[19:22] this perspective because this is what we
[19:23] were forced to learn on back in the old
[19:26] days okay back in the dinosaur time
[19:29] so the rallying up on this candle here
[19:33] and closing on the high that supports
[19:35] this as a swing low because it didn't
[19:36] take out the lower low right here in the
[19:38] middle between this low and this low
[19:41] this is the lowest low of the three
[19:43] candles or Price
[19:45] bars the next day we have a big wash out
[19:49] from the open trading down and then it
[19:51] closed on the high so the next day we're
[19:53] likely to go what into this area here
[19:56] isn't that a fair value Gap sure sure it
[19:59] is what's the daily bias likely to be
[20:01] bullish so that means it's going to do
[20:03] the opposite of this it's going to open
[20:04] near the low and then rally and expand
[20:07] higher will it close on the high I don't
[20:09] know it could but I don't need it to I
[20:12] only need it to open and start to rally
[20:14] and get up in this area here that's an
[20:15] opportunity that's a trade does it do it
[20:18] yes but now when we trade it up into
[20:21] this area look what happens next day you
[20:23] might be expecting an open rally close
[20:26] High it doesn't give you that so that
[20:29] could be a day where you missed an
[20:30] opportunity or you took a a loss no
[20:32] problem next trading day here what are
[20:35] we seeing we're seeing the market
[20:37] retrace back down into this run how far
[20:41] can it go down well look at your high
[20:43] down to your low equilibrium it's
[20:46] probably going to go below equilibrium
[20:47] to do what to offer the market a
[20:50] discount the market does what it goes
[20:52] down below it provides a discount once
[20:54] it gets there our mind we're thinking
[20:57] it's going to be the opposite of this
[20:58] it's going to be to open near the low
[21:00] and expand higher that's power three
[21:03] it's going to be accumulation of Longs
[21:06] at the low and then rally
[21:09] higher we have it right there it opens
[21:12] near the low rally and closes on the
[21:14] high the next day same thing opens on
[21:16] the low rallies and closes on the high
[21:18] now we've gone deeper into this area
[21:20] here and in a small little range but
[21:22] it's still the same function of power
[21:24] three accumulation which is open near
[21:27] the low trade down and then close high
[21:30] on the daily range next candle same
[21:32] thing it opens trades down accumulates
[21:35] Longs trades higher same thing here
[21:37] what's this it opens trades down trades
[21:39] higher until we do what we take out this
[21:42] short-term High see that then we can get
[21:45] a retracement lower or
[21:47] consolidation we get both small little
[21:50] retracement and consolidation next
[21:53] candle power three delivering for
[21:55] accumulation of Longs next candle
[21:58] consolidation might be a day you took a
[22:00] loss let's be real next candle what's
[22:03] the bias what are these over here
[22:05] they're relative equal highs there's
[22:07] stops resting above that that's buy side
[22:09] liquidity what's it drawing up to we've
[22:11] already taken out this High what's going
[22:13] to go up to here likely right because
[22:15] we've already taken out sell stops below
[22:17] here with this drop and we keep proving
[22:19] it's going higher so where's it likely
[22:21] to go above here so until we get to that
[22:24] point we keep thinking the opposite of
[22:26] what we're showing here an open near the
[22:28] low and close on the high power three
[22:30] accumulation of Longs distribution of
[22:33] Longs at the close the next day
[22:35] indecisive candle okay no big deal next
[22:38] candle we open trade down same thing
[22:39] we're looking for buys the whole time
[22:42] we're looking for Buys in here you might
[22:43] get stopped out you might have a losing
[22:45] trade but you're not abandoning the
[22:47] bullish bias until we get above these
[22:50] highs then we have to study it does it
[22:52] want to run higher once it clears these
[22:54] highs does it keep showing and want to
[22:56] go higher well we had a nice run here
[22:58] here the next candle here nice run here
[23:00] small little IND decisive candle there
[23:02] but then we go back in the same cycle
[23:03] again it's expanding and it's
[23:05] accelerating higher each day we're
[23:07] looking for Longs opening near the low
[23:09] trades below the opening a little bit
[23:11] then rallies and closes near the high
[23:14] that's bias that's sticking to your bias
[23:18] and the same thing is done over here on
[23:20] opposite we have imbalance
[23:22] here and I promise after this I'll
[23:24] change it to candlesticks your eyes are
[23:26] probably going nuts right now
[23:29] fair value Gap we trade up into it so
[23:31] once we trade into it what are we
[23:32] expecting the market to do what trade
[23:34] back lower so if we're trading back
[23:36] lower we're going to be looking for this
[23:38] pattern open rally accumulation of
[23:40] shorts distribution at the lows what are
[23:42] you Distributing the short positions
[23:44] they've accumulated above or at the
[23:46] opening price so in this candle what do
[23:49] we have we have the open it rallies up
[23:51] to go short and then trades down closes
[23:54] on the low just like this this here see
[23:56] that the next candle You're Expecting
[23:58] the same thing does it deliver that no
[24:01] you might take a loss that day too okay
[24:03] no big deal it's likely to go
[24:05] where here's where the sell side is
[24:08] now each candle open rally close down on
[24:12] low open rally close down on the low
[24:14] open way back into this one and then
[24:18] still closes lower than the open but
[24:20] still nice range down same thing here
[24:22] opens rallies sells off next candle
[24:25] opens sells off then comes back and
[24:29] overlaps it and now we have a potential
[24:31] key reversal then we have back and forth
[24:33] price action where you can probably get
[24:34] beat
[24:36] up inbalance it trades up into
[24:39] that and then we go into that area where
[24:41] we're at now so let's go to a
[24:43] Candlestick and it's a lot easier to see
[24:44] it this way but this function of Power
[24:48] Three is how I teach the bias and I also
[24:52] teach how to submit to the Daily range
[24:54] you have to learn how to hold to the
[24:56] close if you're going to just
[24:58] trade and you're not really
[25:00] participating in uh the sustained moves
[25:03] that's made available in these daily
[25:05] ranges like today I mean look at this
[25:06] move here that's nice many of you
[25:09] probably took shorts maybe maybe some of
[25:11] you took Longs I got some people putting
[25:13] comments in the previous video saying
[25:15] you know I saw a pair value up at this
[25:17] price at this time for a bullish it's
[25:19] not bullish we're not bu we're our bias
[25:21] is not bullish it's bearish it's already
[25:24] traded to the top end of that fair value
[25:26] got and it's likely to go lower now
[25:29] taking out this cell side and attacking
[25:30] the cell side over here
[25:34] okay all right let's drop down to an
[25:36] hourly chart and that fair value Gap the
[25:40] high and the low levels that's what's
[25:41] being shown here right there and these
[25:45] annotations are obviously from what you
[25:47] saw on the episode 9 so Watch What
[25:50] Happens the market trades down find some
[25:52] support at the low end of the fair value
[25:54] Gap then rallies back up to the high end
[25:56] of the fair value Gap and then
[25:59] breaks right before midnight on the 17th
[26:02] and then we consolidate trade back up
[26:04] into what what is this what's this right
[26:08] here it's a fair value G price goes up
[26:11] rebalances that there and it's doing it
[26:16] what time a
[26:19] day not New York it's overnight European
[26:23] London session that's is how you can use
[26:25] that model the same model you can use it
[26:28] in Asian session you ain't going to get
[26:29] a lot of movement CU it's typically not
[26:32] a lot of movement in that time of day
[26:34] but you can trade it in London clothes
[26:35] you can trade it in obviously the New
[26:37] York open like I'm teaching you and
[26:39] London open London open if you know what
[26:42] you're doing with a daily bias you can
[26:43] catch enormous moves enormous moves but
[26:48] sometimes you're going to have to weigh
[26:49] out a lot of give and take back and
[26:53] forth kind of like today where the
[26:55] market rebalanced here and then
[26:57] consolidated waited for a little bit of
[27:00] a push higher then the news came out
[27:03] okay so I'm kind of hopefully clear that
[27:05] up for you
[27:06] now all right 15minute time frame I'm
[27:08] take a look at this imbalance here we
[27:10] rode up into that rebalancing all this
[27:13] movement down remember that paint roller
[27:15] analogy I gave you the paint was applied
[27:17] to the wall going down but if all this
[27:20] movement was
[27:22] given to that one single candle there's
[27:25] going to be little porous places in
[27:27] prices
[27:28] between the high and the low where the
[27:31] market wasn't efficiently offered for
[27:33] buyers there wasn't much time and back
[27:36] and forth pricing to give buyers an
[27:39] opportunity to get in there and
[27:40] participate so an efficient market we'll
[27:44] see the market go back up and repic that
[27:46] so it's down and then right back up like
[27:49] paint being applied to a roller on a
[27:51] wall you want to make sure you go back
[27:53] and forth to deposit the paint evenly so
[27:56] there's an even distribution so again
[27:58] the background of this chart that's the
[28:00] wall and every one of these candles is a
[28:02] paint roller and whenever you see these
[28:04] big long drawn out candles there's a
[28:07] strong tendency not all the time but
[28:09] there's a strong tendency for the price
[28:11] to go right back up and overlap over
[28:13] that that entire
[28:15] range same thing over here we have the
[28:19] market drop down creates a fair value
[28:21] Gap here doesn't it take out some lows
[28:24] over here yes there's displacement and
[28:27] then you can have an order to get in
[28:28] short here but then watch what happens
[28:32] this little pump up that might be scary
[28:35] it could have stopped you out if it went
[28:36] higher that's the risk in this folks I'm
[28:38] not going to give you a silver bullet
[28:41] that removes losing trades I lose trades
[28:44] too you're going to miss moves I miss
[28:46] moves okay you're going to read it wrong
[28:48] I read it wrong sometimes okay I'm not
[28:50] perfect but I'm giving you tools and
[28:53] processes to help you determine where
[28:56] the most likely scenario is going to be
[28:59] and then you just work those statistical
[29:01] odds and hopefully with sound money
[29:03] management which I'll cover which will
[29:05] hopefully get you to the Winter Circle
[29:07] more often than
[29:09] not all right so we have the morning
[29:11] session starting before 8:30 we have a
[29:14] rally up and then it breaks
[29:16] lower in this area here we're going to
[29:18] have to drop down to a lower time frame
[29:20] but before I do I want to give you a
[29:21] little bit more
[29:24] details think about what I've taught you
[29:26] so far in this teaching for power 3
[29:29] the accumulation manipulation and
[29:32] distribution cycle of the daily range if
[29:34] we are trading near the high end of that
[29:37] fair value gap on the daily chart that's
[29:39] what that level is okay when we just
[29:40] drop down to a lower time frame chart so
[29:43] with this 15minute time frame chart and
[29:45] I apologize the chart's a little bit
[29:46] shifted it's still the same chart I just
[29:48] added the
[29:49] annotations the idea is we're
[29:52] expecting
[29:53] this power three formation where it's
[29:56] open rally create the high of the day
[29:59] sell off and close near the low that's
[30:01] what we're looking for why would that
[30:03] bias be expected on this day because we
[30:06] worked the upper end of that fair value
[30:08] gap on the daily chart then we had
[30:10] multiple shifts in Market structure
[30:13] bearishly when we already have a bearish
[30:15] bias on the daily chart anyway so it
[30:18] gives you a high probability that this
[30:21] day is going to be a down close day it
[30:23] may not close on the low it might just
[30:25] be a big down move
[30:28] and that's all you need you just need
[30:29] movement
[30:31] so this level here it's Dash that's the
[30:34] midnight New York opening
[30:36] price this is what I'm referring to when
[30:38] I'm looking at the opening or power
[30:40] three on a daily chart that price right
[30:43] there at midnight look what's occurring
[30:47] that right there is equivalent to this
[30:49] little tick on this diagram here it
[30:52] opens it trades above the opening just
[30:55] like that candle does on a daily chart
[30:57] it opens and goes is higher you want to
[30:59] be selling short here why would you want
[31:01] to go short here well it went back up in
[31:03] the air and redelivered the down stroke
[31:06] on that paintbrush or or roller on the
[31:08] wall well now it's going back up when
[31:10] it's going up like that it feels
[31:14] unnatural to go short like you don't
[31:16] want to sell short it's like this
[31:17] thing's going up why would I want to go
[31:18] in there and go short that's the benefit
[31:21] of studying old data and then reading
[31:25] price studying it real time and without
[31:27] taking any demo trades without trying to
[31:29] pick the you know the targets forget all
[31:31] that you want to practice for months
[31:34] reading the tape studying price action
[31:36] watching it even if you have to watch it
[31:38] with trading views Market replay
[31:40] function there's nothing inherently
[31:42] wrong with it if that's all you have and
[31:44] you can't watch it live but it is
[31:46] alltogether something different and much
[31:48] more beneficial if you can watch the
[31:49] actual live data so as I mentioned in my
[31:51] own paid mentorship I always counsel my
[31:54] students to if they have the means to do
[31:56] so invest in like like I have Cam Asia
[31:58] Camtasia is what I use to make these
[32:00] videos it's through techsmith and
[32:02] techsmith you can Google them it's
[32:04] pretty inexpensive it's easy platform to
[32:05] use and I have had had wonderful results
[32:09] with it I don't have any complaints I've
[32:11] done all the upgrades every time they
[32:12] have it it's just really
[32:14] good if you have a job or if you have a
[32:17] business that you're running or if you
[32:18] go to school or if you just got to sleep
[32:20] if if the time zones don't line up for
[32:22] you you can set up a recording and just
[32:24] let it record for 8 hours it'll do it
[32:27] and as long as have space in your
[32:28] computer it'll do it and then you can go
[32:30] back and literally play that time real
[32:33] time and watch the candle paint unlike
[32:36] trading views replay function where it
[32:39] doesn't give you the EB and flow of the
[32:41] candlesticks forming it's just basically
[32:43] the opening and then a closing of what
[32:46] the candle did it's kind of clunky and
[32:48] wooden it doesn't really give you that
[32:49] uh organic feel of the candlesticks
[32:52] actually forming real time whereas if
[32:54] you recorded your screen doing it then
[32:57] here it is
[32:59] don't worry about your screen burn in
[33:00] time either uh
[33:02] Camtasia will record the screen if your
[33:06] screen protector comes on and like goes
[33:08] blank it'll still record the screen all
[33:12] right
[33:13] so we're looking at the opening price
[33:15] here and then we're expecting a sell the
[33:18] form well here's that fair value got it
[33:21] rallies up into that isn't that a sell
[33:22] above the opening price yep mhm sure is
[33:26] from that opening price to that High
[33:28] that's the highest high take that range
[33:30] and subtract it from the opening price
[33:32] that's about in this vicinity here okay
[33:35] right in there so what's
[33:38] occurring well we have this cell here
[33:41] then we have this cell here at the open
[33:44] at the equities opening and then we have
[33:46] this imbalance in here so from this
[33:49] Range High to that
[33:52] low multiply that by
[33:55] two as a projection other words whatever
[33:58] that low is to that
[34:01] high that much lower you'll expect to
[34:04] see a short and it forms right here
[34:07] that's exactly what I taught you I did
[34:09] not cherry-pick that folks you can go
[34:10] back and look at data as long as you can
[34:12] find data on daily charts okay and if
[34:15] you can get a intraday chart like an
[34:17] hourly chart you'll see it it's there
[34:20] but this is a 15-minute time frame
[34:21] that's my bell weather chart that's what
[34:23] I teach all my students this is the one
[34:24] you go to for day trades and or scalps
[34:27] you can find everything for intraday
[34:29] trading on a 15-minute time frame if I
[34:32] was held to a decision of what time
[34:35] frame would you be forced to trade with
[34:37] if you had to pick just one ICT the
[34:39] 15-minute time frame because I can I can
[34:41] do anything with that 15minute time
[34:43] frame I can swing trade I can short-term
[34:46] trade I can day trade I can
[34:49] scalp but you only need to have one
[34:52] discipline one way of doing it and you
[34:55] might not like the 15minute time frame
[34:58] you might like the one minute chart if
[34:59] you're trading indices but you have to
[35:01] have the storyline of the 15-minute time
[35:03] frame to get the full panoramic view of
[35:05] what price is likely to do so with this
[35:09] continued teaching here right below here
[35:12] what's that at sell side liquidity
[35:15] relative equal lows so you can test this
[35:18] on your own chart I admitted it by
[35:20] mistake I apologize but the low on this
[35:23] candle here is
[35:25] 14381 even
[35:28] okay don't take my word for it go look
[35:29] at your own chart it's there so 14,
[35:34] 381 I would have preferred to include a
[35:39] line projecting that out in time because
[35:41] you'll see in a moment when we drop down
[35:42] the lower time frame but the setups are
[35:44] forming here above the opening price
[35:47] right here near the opening price see
[35:49] that and inside of the range from the
[35:52] high to the opening projected down it's
[35:54] in that vicinity there so it's giving
[35:56] you another opportunity
[36:02] so again what's occurred is we went up
[36:05] into that fair value gap on the daily
[36:07] chart we're back on the daily chart
[36:08] again and we're anticipating the opening
[36:11] and rallying up into
[36:14] what maybe the high end of that fair
[36:17] value Gap or something
[36:21] forming at the news release at 8:30 but
[36:24] if we look at price price was starting
[36:27] to pump up higher ahead of the 8:30 news
[36:29] release so what's that tipping its hand
[36:32] to you telling you they're pricing in a
[36:35] premium Market ahead of the news so
[36:38] they're going to use the news to sink it
[36:39] lower because the bearish bias is going
[36:41] to come into to
[36:43] fruition they're going to expand price
[36:45] lower and they've already established
[36:47] their shorts because they accumulated
[36:49] above the opening price and we can see
[36:51] that in the price action of each little
[36:54] short-term rally up like we're looking
[36:56] at here so here's 7:00 in the morning it
[36:58] rallies above these relative equal highs
[37:01] and cleans up the imbalance
[37:03] here and look at that right there see
[37:05] that remember what I told you if there's
[37:07] two fair value gaps try to trade it in
[37:10] here but anticipate and use the money
[37:13] management to allow for your stock to
[37:15] weather a run up into that and we got it
[37:17] right there now strip it down to what I
[37:20] taught you for the structure of the
[37:22] trade or the
[37:23] framework swing High broken to the
[37:26] upside taking out buy stops so buy side
[37:28] liquidity is taken then we have a swing
[37:31] low it's broken did these candles come
[37:33] down lethargically was it like a slow
[37:36] meand or decline no it was sudden it was
[37:40] a lot of momentum it was energetic you
[37:43] can't miss those down closed candles
[37:44] right there that's obvious they stand
[37:46] out right so that's how you know you
[37:49] have a shift in Market structure in this
[37:52] area here it doesn't have a fair value
[37:54] Gap that's okay this is only a 5-minute
[37:56] chart this is where we started doing a
[37:58] top down strip of 5 minute 4 minute 3
[38:03] minute 2 minute 1 minute the first fair
[38:06] value G we come to if we find one on a
[38:09] four minute you don't need to go down to
[38:10] a three you don't need to go down to a
[38:12] two you don't need to go down to a one
[38:14] if you go down to a four you don't see
[38:16] one you go down to a three if you find
[38:17] one there you don't go any
[38:19] lower okay if you don't find one on the
[38:21] five the four or the three and you go
[38:23] down to the two minute and you find it
[38:25] there that's it you don't go down to the
[38:26] one minute
[38:28] if you don't find it on a
[38:30] two-minute and you do find it on a one
[38:32] minute then there that's how you trade
[38:34] it but what if you don't have one on the
[38:35] one minute chart you don't have a trade
[38:38] how's that for
[38:39] logic so we have the continuation lower
[38:44] off of a retracement in here now this
[38:47] candle the high of it here I wish I
[38:48] would have use a lighter color but this
[38:51] candle's high is right there okay it
[38:54] actually goes just above that one right
[38:57] there not by much but it does but we
[39:00] don't need that we don't need that Watch
[39:02] What
[39:06] Happens here's the 4minute
[39:09] chart uh oh something different on this
[39:12] chart ain't it we have bide liquidity
[39:15] here the candles are a little bit more
[39:17] beefier when we were looking at the
[39:18] previous slide look at this one look at
[39:21] the candles are look wonky don't
[39:23] they but on this time frame they become
[39:26] much more prominent more beefy much more
[39:28] Stout like look at me I'm here take a
[39:31] take a look at me that's what we're
[39:34] looking for we're looking for clean
[39:36] price action where we can see the nice
[39:38] Candlestick
[39:40] formations where we're seeing the even
[39:42] distribution of the price going higher
[39:44] or lower in this case going lower but
[39:46] we're seeing that little
[39:47] break where there's not an even
[39:50] distribution of price that's the fair
[39:53] value got so we have that run above byet
[39:55] liquidity after rebalancing over here it
[39:58] goes above it and it breaks down so we
[40:01] have an idea okay we could potentially
[40:05] see a a trade short
[40:07] here I like this fair value gy but we
[40:10] also have a little bit of imbalance in
[40:11] here so I want to trade in here but my
[40:14] money management has to permit me to
[40:18] weather a run up into this area too
[40:20] remember that that's part of the rules
[40:22] but in here we're going a little bit
[40:26] deeper
[40:27] in my YouTube channel I teach a breaker
[40:30] pattern okay and that is a high a low
[40:34] and a higher high that's what this
[40:37] pattern is here and we're seeing that
[40:39] return here so if I see a breaker like
[40:42] this yes I think the market could
[40:45] potentially trade up into here but I'm
[40:47] going to use the breaker's candle and
[40:48] just above that for my stop so I'm not
[40:50] going to go way up here or way up in
[40:52] here cuz my Foundation to teaching the
[40:56] ICT breaker
[40:57] is the Market's going to mostly stay in
[41:00] the lower half of the breaker candle
[41:02] which is the down down Clos candle rate
[41:04] for the big move up higher taking out a
[41:06] short-term High trust me the breaker is
[41:09] taught in the YouTube channel in other
[41:12] lessons I'm not going to pour myself
[41:14] over top of lessons and regurgitate
[41:16] things because there's a lot of you that
[41:18] have been training with me for a long
[41:20] time and you don't want to go through
[41:21] that and the new people that are here I
[41:24] understand your enthusiasm and you want
[41:25] to know everything like a SP I get it
[41:27] and I love it but trust me when I tell
[41:29] you that is taught in the free lessons
[41:33] in this YouTube channel okay just
[41:34] remember it's a bearish breaker and that
[41:37] pattern is the support structure of why
[41:39] I would not expect it to have have a
[41:41] higher stop up here okay so here's the
[41:45] fair value got range from the
[41:47] low and the high end but it's
[41:50] specifically this candle's low and this
[41:51] candle's high right there extend that
[41:53] out in time look what happens at eight
[41:57] 28 the candle showing 828 here because
[41:59] it's a 4minute
[42:01] chart but once we're trading inside here
[42:03] all I need to do is trade Above This
[42:04] candle's High I want to be short I don't
[42:07] want to mess around it might not give me
[42:08] an opportunity to get in it might not go
[42:10] higher up into that fair value guy I
[42:11] want to use the easiest lowest threshold
[42:13] entry technique to get in to make sure
[42:15] I'm a part of the
[42:17] move then I'm going to be aiming for
[42:19] those relative equal lows that's that
[42:23] 14381 level
[42:25] 14381 remember that relative equal lows
[42:28] I said I wish I would have put a line on
[42:29] it this is the time frame I added the
[42:30] line it's the 4-minute chart now if you
[42:33] look real close you can see there's a
[42:34] little tiny little arrow right there and
[42:37] a bunch of them over
[42:39] here what that is is trading views paper
[42:43] trading module and I put some short on
[42:47] this today to illustrate what many of
[42:51] you have been asking me in trading view
[42:54] comment section A lot of you send me
[42:57] comments through trading View and I
[42:59] apologize I don't get to them a lot
[43:00] because there's a lot of them usually
[43:01] that happen and I just don't get to them
[43:03] I'm sorry I'm not purposely trying to
[43:05] ignore you it's like telegram telegram
[43:08] people send me messages there too and I
[43:10] just don't I don't have time to go
[43:11] through it emails absolutely I don't
[43:13] have a whole lot of time to get through
[43:14] because everybody wants to write a long
[43:16] story to me and I appreciate them but I
[43:17] just can't I can't sit there all day
[43:19] long and read all
[43:20] that
[43:22] but the idea of showing
[43:27] what a discount broker margin what what
[43:32] could I do with that okay I don't
[43:34] recommend it but there are Brokers out
[43:37] there that will allow you to trade the
[43:39] mini contract for just a couple thousand
[43:42] and the micro for less than a 100 bucks
[43:46] and to me that is
[43:48] absolutely stupid you're asking to blow
[43:52] the account in these markets you
[43:54] absolutely can have your hinder Parts
[43:56] handed to you in short sudden
[44:01] fashion even me in the last I don't know
[44:05] four weeks or so I've seen moves that
[44:08] came back on my stop so fast I was like
[44:11] wow just the other day I watched a 100o
[44:13] Run come out of nowhere in a one minute
[44:16] candle it moved 100 points in the NASDAQ
[44:20] one minute that's a lot of movement man
[44:24] so if you're looking at that and you're
[44:27] trying to hold let's say I don't know 16
[44:32] minis or eight Minis and it moves $2,000
[44:37] against you in one minute folks your
[44:39] stop would not have been
[44:42] respected it was literally way above
[44:45] your stop- loss if you were using one
[44:48] okay so you would have got stopped out
[44:51] with negative slippage and let's say you
[44:54] were holding those eight
[44:55] contracts well let's say you got burned
[44:57] for 50 points in slippage and you don't
[45:00] think that's possible oh it's
[45:02] there 50 points just like this that's
[45:06] $1,000 times your eight contracts you
[45:09] just lost $88,000 and you're going to
[45:11] tell me that you can open up an account
[45:14] with a I don't know $10,000 whatever and
[45:16] you're going to trade
[45:19] multiple minis because the discount
[45:21] broker allows you to and all of a sudden
[45:24] you just roasted your account in one
[45:26] trade and some wild little price move
[45:29] that came out of nowhere that you didn't
[45:31] expect and in one candle one minute
[45:35] candle it just smoked your account just
[45:37] like
[45:38] that there's teachers out there that are
[45:42] promoting the idea that that's a good
[45:44] idea it's not a good idea
[45:47] folks
[45:49] $10,000 that's the absolute minimum and
[45:51] I don't think it should be that I think
[45:52] it should be a little bit higher than
[45:55] that I think 15 ,000 is fair for what
[45:58] the NASDAQ is doing right now because
[46:00] just today
[46:01] alone moved 8,000 per for one single
[46:06] count contract over $88,000 in movement
[46:09] for one
[46:11] contract now that's you know top to
[46:14] bottom and likck of you being in that
[46:16] move is probably you know obviously not
[46:19] likely
[46:20] but the measure of risk needs to be
[46:23] appreciated and respected and
[46:25] unfortunately YouTube makes it a
[46:26] available for anybody to come out here
[46:29] and pretend to know what they're doing
[46:31] and unfortunately if that person isn't
[46:32] skilled if they don't really do what
[46:34] they say they do or or teach proper risk
[46:37] or to teach you to respect the level of
[46:40] risk that's required to trade these
[46:41] markets they're doing you a
[46:44] disservice
[46:46] and that's the number one reason why I
[46:49] taught for a long time with a demo and
[46:52] still teach with a demo because number
[46:54] one legal reasons I'm not trying to be
[46:56] held liable
[46:57] because I'm not licensed to get trade
[46:59] advice but it's not trade advice in a
[47:00] demo account you're not making or losing
[47:02] anything it's fantasy football with
[47:04] price charts but you can learn how to
[47:06] read price action with it this year I've
[47:08] been showing you a live account that's
[47:11] real I'm not teaching through that
[47:14] notice that okay at the end of the year
[47:17] I'm going to share with you what that
[47:18] account has done I'll be 100%
[47:21] transparent I will show you line by line
[47:24] every single trade from every single
[47:26] Trading day of every single trading week
[47:28] of every month you'll see it
[47:32] okay throughout the year I'm going to be
[47:34] teaching lessons about certain things
[47:36] and you're going to see them applied
[47:37] when I share the entire history with
[47:40] that account so it's more meaningful CU
[47:44] there's a lot of you in the comment
[47:46] sections that are trolling and I I know
[47:49] what you're here for but I'm going to
[47:51] give you undeniable proof just like the
[47:55] rest of you that way you can see the
[47:57] lessons I'm giving you yes they worked
[47:59] in demo but they're actually being
[48:02] utilized in live fund trading by me it's
[48:06] after the fact so I cannot be accused of
[48:08] giving you trade advice it's what I did
[48:10] with my real
[48:11] money see the difference
[48:14] there it is what it is if you don't like
[48:16] this teaching style there's other people
[48:18] out there teaching all kinds of great
[48:19] stuff doesn't mean it's profitable but
[48:21] they got all kinds of neat stuff to look
[48:22] at I'm teaching you how to read price
[48:25] and I need you to be sober minded about
[48:27] the level of risk that these markets
[48:29] provide us because it can take you out
[48:33] quickly so I got questioned by I don't
[48:38] know six or seven of the people some of
[48:41] them are actually my students in the
[48:43] mentorship and others are just people
[48:45] that are on the internet you I don't
[48:47] know if they're just YouTube or if
[48:48] they're just trading VI you people that
[48:50] try to follow me on
[48:52] there but they asked could I showcase
[48:56] what I would do with a $10,000
[48:59] hypothetical account if I was using a
[49:02] discount broker in other words a broker
[49:03] that would let me trade with I don't
[49:04] know like $2,000 or $1,500 per contract
[49:07] something to that effect for a NASDAQ
[49:09] mini
[49:10] contract number one it
[49:14] was crazy trying to find some of those
[49:17] setups because to frame the risk in it
[49:20] and to do Big Lot sizes too was very
[49:24] challenging but
[49:27] I kept it lowend it only took me two
[49:29] weeks to do this but you can see I put a
[49:33] heavy-handed short up here using what
[49:35] I'm teaching you here and then aiming
[49:38] for there's relative equal loads which
[49:39] is that
[49:40] 14381
[49:44] level this is my trading VI account now
[49:46] you're going to hear people say this is
[49:48] photoshopped oh you photoshopped this no
[49:51] I did not I don't need to photoshop this
[49:53] in fact my live mentorship with real
[49:56] students that paid me they're going to
[49:58] see me show this live and it's going to
[50:01] move all around it's not edited I'm
[50:03] going to log out of the account and log
[50:04] back in so it's not me doing any kind of
[50:06] editing it's not mt4 servers or anything
[50:09] like that you can play around with it's
[50:10] not ninja Trader you can go in there and
[50:12] take a bad trade out make it look good
[50:14] all these things here are executions
[50:18] okay and you can see there's three
[50:19] losing trades there on the
[50:22] 14th and where's you can see today's
[50:26] trades all up at the top and that was me
[50:28] doing a
[50:29] heavy-handed a uh
[50:32] Quant style heavy-handed short and then
[50:36] taking partials as it was going down
[50:37] into that level of
[50:41] 14381 looking at this this is your
[50:44] classic you know the guy shows you the
[50:47] results okay shows you this is what I
[50:49] did with my demo account they may lie
[50:51] and say it's a real account this is
[50:53] clearly a paper trading account you can
[50:55] see it it's there it says it right up
[50:56] here paper trading okay paper trading
[51:00] this is all paper money okay I started
[51:03] the account with trading View at
[51:06] $10,000 okay and that was on February
[51:09] 3rd just two weeks ago to the day okay
[51:13] so two Thursdays ago I started this and
[51:16] set the account to start with
[51:20] $10,000 then I started trading it and
[51:22] you can see the positions here with just
[51:24] the NASDAQ okay I'm not doing anything
[51:28] with like Forex to make it go up I'm not
[51:31] trying to pull out bonds I'm not trying
[51:32] to do anything like that I'm showing you
[51:34] just the
[51:37] NASDAQ starting with $10,000 in two
[51:39] weeks using again the limitations of
[51:43] well I guess I don't want to say
[51:45] limitations the pseudo benefit of a
[51:48] discount broker what could I do in two
[51:51] weeks doing that and using what I'm
[51:55] teaching you too
[51:57] that's the difference I'm literally
[51:59] teaching what I'm showing here I just
[52:02] showed you the example of it in the
[52:04] chart
[52:05] before this is the
[52:08] equivalent of 582 in 2 weeks now it's
[52:12] hypothetically done in paper trading yes
[52:15] but with the perspective of a
[52:17] hypothetical discount broker margin
[52:19] being used so whereas I'm trading with
[52:22] tdmr trade right now and they require me
[52:25] to have almost 20 $2,000 to trade one
[52:29] contract I don't have a problem with
[52:31] that because of the level of volatility
[52:33] that's in there it just makes it easy
[52:35] for me not to worry about it like I'm
[52:37] not worried about it I know I got plenty
[52:38] of margin I know I got plenty of equity
[52:40] if I get banged by something come out of
[52:42] nowhere say Russia goes into Ukraine or
[52:45] China invades Taiwan or something crazy
[52:48] comes out and it crosses the market to
[52:49] go nuts because I expect that to be
[52:51] coming anytime
[52:53] now it won't smoke my account okay I'm
[52:57] not gonna I'm not going to blow the
[52:58] account I guarantee you this account's
[53:00] not blowing okay and I'm showing in my
[53:04] opinion what it would be like for
[53:06] someone if they ever got to the point
[53:09] where they put years into developing
[53:11] their own
[53:12] model now that doesn't mean you can't
[53:14] find profitability before that but after
[53:16] you've done it for a while and you found
[53:17] your own niche of what you want to do
[53:19] with the content I'm teaching you you'll
[53:21] find your own Groove and once that's
[53:23] done and you can formulate a well-
[53:26] written
[53:27] model on paper where everything is
[53:29] outlined when do you buy when do you
[53:31] sell where do you put your stop at when
[53:32] do you move your stop how many contracts
[53:35] do you trade you know what constitutes a
[53:37] day where you don't take a trade all
[53:39] those types of things I will teach you
[53:40] those lessons in this YouTube mentorship
[53:42] okay a lot of you also are very very
[53:45] excited and you're like okay I I see you
[53:46] doing this but I'm not really learning
[53:48] anything new I'm
[53:50] disappointed I'm not done you give me
[53:52] those complaints after I say I'm done
[53:54] okay but I'm giving you gold like this
[53:57] is something that you can go out there
[53:58] and turn in these markets and really
[54:02] develop a skill set that could
[54:04] completely change your whole entire
[54:07] Direction in your life I'm not promising
[54:10] profitability notice that see that I'm
[54:12] not promising that I'm not promising you
[54:13] a sixf figure income every year I'm not
[54:15] doing that either I'm telling you that
[54:17] you will love price action because it
[54:21] repeats it's something
[54:22] that's well it repeats and if you know
[54:26] something's going to repeat it's
[54:28] familiar and things that are familiar
[54:30] are comfortable right now you don't know
[54:33] what these patterns are likely to do
[54:35] you're they're unfamiliar to you so it's
[54:38] it's important for you to understand
[54:39] that that's a temporary struggling point
[54:42] but going through the things I'm going
[54:43] to teach you to do here and I'm
[54:44] streamlining it yes this doesn't feel
[54:46] like streamlining to some of you you
[54:47] want me to come out here and say this is
[54:49] where you buy this is where you sell you
[54:50] put put your stop loss right here and
[54:51] this is where you take your profits and
[54:53] it's always like this every single time
[54:54] wash rinse repeat and it never violates
[54:57] any of those rules and it's just always
[54:58] the same way if you think that way just
[55:00] change this channel right now don't even
[55:02] come back here because that's not
[55:05] reality there's going to be similarities
[55:07] that look slightly different than the
[55:09] last few times you took the trade but
[55:10] you will recognize
[55:12] them but my question to you
[55:17] is if you could do
[55:21] this
[55:23] over a year
[55:26] not two weeks would you be impressed
[55:29] with yourself if you could do that would
[55:31] you feel that that would be
[55:33] enough some of you young guys don't
[55:35] think that this is
[55:36] enough and
[55:38] it's amazing that type of return is
[55:41] amazing if you can t if you can turn
[55:43] that with a live account that's
[55:45] phenomenal like that's that's wealth
[55:48] making there you don't need to be that
[55:51] high to make money but if you can hit
[55:54] that kind of number a year over 12
[55:57] months hit something like that that's
[55:59] amazing and that's not even what I teach
[56:03] my students to
[56:04] expect and I'm not this is not bragging
[56:07] I'm not trying to say look at me I can
[56:09] trade a demo account look at me that's
[56:11] not what I'm doing here folks okay I was
[56:13] asked sincerely to
[56:16] show you all hear me telling you and I'm
[56:19] sh I'm showing you it's a paper trading
[56:21] account because I'm not going to go into
[56:24] amp or some other broker that's going to
[56:27] allow me to trade with discount broker
[56:29] margins I'm not going to do it I know I
[56:33] know even what I know I'm going to get
[56:36] smoked if I try to do something crazy
[56:38] and heavy-handed because even with me
[56:40] trading one contract I've had moves come
[56:43] against me pretty
[56:44] sudden and there was nothing I could
[56:46] have done about it because the
[56:48] volatility is so Fierce right now I'm
[56:50] not afraid of it but I do absolutely
[56:52] respect it so to
[56:56] provide a answer
[56:59] to the guys out there that say that yeah
[57:02] you it's stupid to trade in another
[57:05] account where they use the exchange rate
[57:08] margins for initial margins which is
[57:10] right now almost $22,000 for the NASDAQ
[57:13] One Mini contract you need about
[57:15] $222,000 it was about $17,604.13
[57:27] listen this is for your notes okay if
[57:29] they raise the
[57:30] margins that's the exchange tipping
[57:33] their hand to you that huge moves are
[57:36] coming big monstrous moves are coming
[57:40] and they just raised the margins you
[57:43] think that's coincidence it's not big
[57:46] moves are coming and if you're
[57:49] offside it's going to get real hot in
[57:51] the Underpants
[57:53] but if you're on side man there ain't
[57:56] nothing sweeter than that that's like
[57:58] winning a lottery and these moves are
[58:01] significant I mean let's go back up for
[58:04] a second okay and I'll close this
[58:07] video if you look at the fair value Gap
[58:09] in here okay and say you're filled at
[58:14] 14,515 and you're aiming for 14,
[58:17] 381 is that 6 and a half
[58:21] points no is it
[58:24] 20 no no is it
[58:28] 50 mm- is it
[58:32] 100
[58:33] nope it's
[58:36] more do you see a pattern here one
[58:41] contract folks what I'm teaching you is
[58:45] literally a ATM machine in your
[58:48] hands I'm giving you the PIN numbers
[58:51] every time I do a video here I'm giving
[58:53] you another digit
[58:56] and once you figure out what it is that
[58:58] you want to do with this content and
[59:00] make it part of
[59:02] you and you'll see what I mean by that
[59:04] right now you might see me showing you
[59:06] it's like man this makes perfect sense
[59:08] most of the comments that I don't allow
[59:10] to be posted are just sugar sweet
[59:12] diabetic coma type lovey doy comments
[59:16] and I'm not making fun of that and I
[59:18] appreciate I know what you mean by it
[59:20] and you want to show your adoration and
[59:22] respect I love
[59:24] that but don't lose sight that you're
[59:27] feeling that Splash over because I'm
[59:30] literally taking you into the chart and
[59:32] showing you what I
[59:34] know and you're excited because you know
[59:36] the opportunity is available to you if
[59:39] you stick to this and that's the right
[59:40] perspective but don't lose sight and
[59:42] think that I just watch that video and
[59:44] I'm going to go out there and trade
[59:45] because I've had some people post in the
[59:47] comment section and they try to do
[59:49] something with Live accounts which I
[59:50] already said no don't do that and
[59:52] they're saying I I don't think these
[59:54] Concepts work because I try to do this
[59:56] and I tried to buy this fair value Gap
[59:57] today and you know who you are and I'm
[59:59] not trying to make fun of you I'm not
[60:00] talking down to you but the bias is
[60:03] bearish so if the bias is bearish would
[60:05] you go in looking for a bullish fair
[60:07] value Gap no that's that's the purpose
[60:10] of having a model and in with that model
[60:13] each morning before the markets even
[60:14] start trading you write down what your
[60:17] intentions
[60:18] are what does that mean I gave you the
[60:21] range right here's the opening price it
[60:24] rallies up to that so inside that range
[60:27] you're going to look for a set out to go
[60:28] short you're bearish and if it goes down
[60:31] below that low you can still take a
[60:32] short if it's in this range minus this
[60:34] low
[60:35] okay if it leaves that area you can't
[60:38] chase it I don't care how good it looks
[60:41] later in the day you don't do it you
[60:43] have to have discipline folks if you
[60:44] don't have discipline your broker's not
[60:46] going to help you with that they want
[60:48] you to click that button that's how you
[60:49] make money and they don't care if you
[60:51] blow your account because there's going
[60:53] to be 20 more to replace you because
[60:55] they watch watched ICT videos they've
[60:59] watched everybody else on YouTube that
[61:03] try to tell you that you can do this and
[61:05] it's so easy even a pizza delivery boy
[61:07] can do
[61:08] it so hopefully this has helped clear up
[61:13] the idea of bias and power three and I
[61:17] will be repeating these themes when it's
[61:21] applicable in the newer videos that come
[61:23] out and examples I'm going to teach with
[61:26] but for
[61:27] now I can't say it enough what you were
[61:30] just exposed to that is the
[61:34] underpinnings of what we do in my Camp
[61:38] okay
[61:39] ICT my students we look at Price like
[61:42] that let me throw one more thing in here
[61:44] just to piss off everybody that doesn't
[61:46] like these long
[61:48] videos let me go back up in this area
[61:50] real quick and on the daily chart with
[61:53] the candlesticks is what I'm looking for
[61:55] here
[61:57] here we go all right notice something
[62:01] from this low up to this
[62:03] high it's bullish okay we're expecting
[62:07] bullish prices this is how you back test
[62:08] you tell yourself in your annotations I
[62:11] was expecting you're you're basically
[62:13] lying to yourself in the in the comments
[62:15] of your chart when you're back testing
[62:17] it sounds foolish okay trolls are going
[62:19] to love that comment coming out of my
[62:21] mouth but what you're doing is is you're
[62:23] teaching
[62:24] yourself SU
[62:26] experience it's training your
[62:28] subconscious to see this stuff like you
[62:31] saw it live and when you record it on
[62:33] the chart in your own annotations and
[62:35] you log it and you keep it in your
[62:37] journal and on the weekend you go back
[62:39] and look at your Monday Tuesday
[62:40] Wednesday Thursday Friday and and you
[62:42] look at the previous
[62:43] week and you start looking at these
[62:45] patterns and how it repeats over and
[62:46] over again when it's bullish you're
[62:50] trying to stay with the opposite of this
[62:52] open near the low close near the high
[62:53] but expansion to the upside so
[62:56] accumulate Longs manipulate get people
[62:58] thinking it's going to go lower and then
[63:00] Ram it up higher distribute the Longs
[63:04] near the close that's what you're
[63:06] looking for here with that mindset okay
[63:09] you're all afraid of but what happens if
[63:11] it's a down day ICT what happens well
[63:15] the worst thing it can happen is you
[63:16] lose
[63:17] money and if you think that you're going
[63:19] to trade and not ever lose
[63:22] money turning the videos off don't ever
[63:24] watch anybody else's either because
[63:26] that's not a proper mindset Traders are
[63:29] professional losers they're managing
[63:31] every trade right from the beginning
[63:34] they got to come out of the costs you're
[63:35] paying a commission and if you got
[63:38] slipped in Forex you got to
[63:41] spread every trade opens up as a loser
[63:44] so a Trader is a professional management
[63:48] company of losing trades they turn
[63:51] losers into winners but not every loser
[63:54] can be turned into a winner but they
[63:56] don't lose their business because a few
[64:00] never become winners it's real important
[64:03] to understand that folks it's a paradigm
[64:05] shift that took place when I was a
[64:06] younger man I felt that there was a way
[64:08] for me to always win I was convinced of
[64:11] it there isn't there is no way of doing
[64:14] that okay so last analogy last lesson
[64:17] and the video is over if we're bullish
[64:19] here okay we're expecting each candle to
[64:22] expand higher so in other words the
[64:23] close be higher than the opening on each
[64:25] individual
[64:27] candle my up candles are
[64:29] green how
[64:31] many black or down Clos candles do you
[64:34] see in this price
[64:38] run
[64:40] two wow how about this price moveed here
[64:44] it's going lower right going down for
[64:45] the sell side here you're bearish but
[64:48] what happens ICT if it goes up you'll
[64:53] probably lose
[64:54] money but let's count how many up closed
[64:57] candle we have one two 3 four five look
[65:02] how much range it
[65:04] moved if you can't have a model that
[65:08] weathers say you got a losing trade each
[65:10] one of those days if that blows your
[65:13] account you're not managing your risk
[65:15] properly you're overleveraging or
[65:17] overtrading see how easy that is to
[65:19] deduce your
[65:21] problems it's simple stuff folks but
[65:23] you're you're scaring yourself
[65:26] you're overthinking things you're
[65:28] listening to me talk about multiple
[65:30] Concepts that will come together in a
[65:32] few weeks but you're overthinking
[65:36] everything and you're trying to assume
[65:38] just because you watched a few videos
[65:40] and you're thinking foolishly that just
[65:42] by watching a few of these videos we're
[65:44] only in episode
[65:45] 10 10 episodes and some of you think you
[65:48] can go out there and own the world
[65:51] now I understand it's empowering
[65:54] information if you've never been in uced
[65:55] to it but you're not going to own the
[65:58] world up to episode 10 okay you're not
[66:02] going to do that you're going to lose
[66:03] money if you go out there and try to
[66:04] rush to try to do this stuff there's a
[66:06] lot of things we still have to cover and
[66:08] you haven't even back tested enough I
[66:10] haven't even been teaching it long
[66:11] enough on YouTube for you to even have a
[66:13] backlog of data to draw experience from
[66:18] so think about that okay trust me when I
[66:21] tell you folks these moves repeat all
[66:22] the time all the time and don't feel
[66:26] like you're missing out because you're
[66:27] not doing it right
[66:29] now put that feeling aside make this fun
[66:33] while you're learning it and it'll never
[66:35] feel like a job or a tedious task that's
[66:38] going to be it for this one hopefully it
[66:40] was insightful to you and until I'll
[66:41] talk to you next Tuesday enjoy your
[66:43] weekend and be safe
