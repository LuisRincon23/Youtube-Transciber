[00:13] all right folks well we're
[00:16] here so technically this is the first
[00:20] teaching uh I gave you guys an in
[00:21] introduction video obviously if you
[00:23] haven't watched that one yet go to the
[00:24] playlist on my YouTube channel and
[00:27] please watch that one because it'll help
[00:28] at least establish the in my opinion the
[00:32] proper expectations that way you
[00:35] understand what you're getting involved
[00:35] with here and at least it gives me a
[00:38] chance to kind of like break the ice and
[00:41] show you the contrast of what you may be
[00:44] expecting versus what I intend to
[00:46] deliver all right so this first
[00:48] installment is going to be elements to a
[00:50] trade
[00:54] setup all right
[00:57] so coming out of the gate I just want to
[00:59] let you know this is predominantly going
[01:01] to be a Futures index trading mentorship
[01:07] okay the idea is going to be presented
[01:10] in the scope of paper trading on
[01:14] tradingview.com
[01:15] but what you're looking at here this is
[01:19] thinker swims live data these are actual
[01:22] executions I made today and I want you
[01:24] to compare and contrast with what you
[01:27] see on YouTube and other educat where
[01:31] they'll tout that they can do this and
[01:33] they can do that but really I want you
[01:36] to compare and contrast what you see
[01:38] here all right so we're looking at
[01:41] intraday price action for Nasdaq e- mini
[01:45] Futures and this is actually uh the the
[01:48] main focus of this mentorship okay um I
[01:52] believe that this Market is worth
[01:56] studying I believe it is not just
[01:58] limited to NASDAQ but I believe it's
[02:03] useful to learn as
[02:06] a Trader that views obviously the e-
[02:09] mini S&P the e- mini Dow future and the
[02:12] e- mini NASDAQ now e- mini NASDAQ is a
[02:15] little bit faster a little bit more
[02:18] aggressive
[02:19] and even with that you can still trade
[02:22] it
[02:23] so I want you to think
[02:25] about what it means to watch price
[02:28] action and understand what it's likely
[02:30] to do before it does it now I'm not
[02:32] promising you're going to be able to do
[02:33] that right out of the gate what I'm
[02:35] going to show you is the compare and
[02:38] contrast to how I can trade versus what
[02:42] I'm promising to teach you in this
[02:44] mentorship how to find specific setups
[02:47] in your demo account okay or your paper
[02:49] trading account I'm not trying to entice
[02:52] you to trade with live funds okay so
[02:53] that way we know this going
[02:56] in the teachings will be predominantly
[02:59] through the school scope of
[03:00] tradingview.com paper trading module or
[03:04] just hindsight data now I already know
[03:07] some of you are oh here we go the
[03:09] hindsight
[03:10] guy well what you're looking at here is
[03:13] actually live executions from today okay
[03:16] and I want you to think about if you
[03:18] were able to trade a micro account and
[03:22] you were trading the Naas deck and you
[03:26] were able to capture just one of these
[03:29] moves which one would you like
[03:31] to learn how to find obviously you
[03:34] probably look at this and think well I'd
[03:35] like to do all of them but I want you to
[03:37] think about which one really stands
[03:40] out off the entire chart and this is a
[03:43] one minute chart which one really stands
[03:46] out I'll give you a moment you can pause
[03:48] the video and unpause it when you're
[03:52] ready some of you folks never ever pause
[03:56] it all right so obviously we can see how
[03:59] the Market moves from here okay two
[04:03] orders executed here whenever you see
[04:05] this this is actually a reversal so if
[04:09] there is a trade on long it'll reverse
[04:12] and take you the other direction okay
[04:15] and then this one here this is a
[04:17] reversal as
[04:19] well then another another close and then
[04:23] another long entry the exit a short
[04:28] entry and then the cover okay I'd like
[04:31] for you to consider what it would take
[04:32] for you to find consistency and how many
[04:35] handles how many
[04:37] full handle moves in an index Futures
[04:41] Contract that would satisfy you and when
[04:44] I say a handle that's essentially four
[04:46] ticks the minimum fluctuation in these
[04:49] markets an example would be if you were
[04:52] trading the EM S&P and you were trading
[04:54] obviously the
[04:57] 4450 level and you went long if it went
[04:59] to
[05:00] 4451 that's a full handle okay or four
[05:02] ticks or four * $12.50 or $50 per handle
[05:08] the nas deck is $20 per handle so it's
[05:11] slightly different but it's faster it
[05:14] moves a lot more lot more handles a lot
[05:16] more
[05:18] aggression now it doesn't always move
[05:21] faster sometimes we'll have a lethargic
[05:25] price action in this Indy or another out
[05:28] of the three that would be the S&P the
[05:31] NASDAQ and the
[05:33] Dow I personally don't trade the Dow
[05:36] that much but there's a lot of my
[05:37] students that love trading the ym but ym
[05:41] is the symbol for the Futures Contract
[05:42] and these three markets have the luxury
[05:46] for you that may not have the capability
[05:49] to put up to like
[05:50] $177,000 margin if you were going to
[05:52] trade one full contract of the NASDAQ
[05:54] futures most Brokers unless you're using
[05:56] a discount broker they're going to
[05:57] require you to have Deep Pockets and
[05:59] sense that you're going to have that
[06:00] about $177,000 and about 12,000 and a
[06:04] half for an e- Min S&P for Futures
[06:06] Contract okay you take
[06:11] basically a fraction of that and you can
[06:14] trade a micro on each one of these
[06:16] markets but obviously it reduces the
[06:19] number of the tick multiplier because
[06:22] you're trading with a lot less
[06:24] technically
[06:25] leverage so I'm going to get into all
[06:27] that but I just kind of like want to
[06:30] begin the
[06:31] conversation informally but also to kind
[06:34] of like show you what it is that I do
[06:38] versus what other people do okay
[06:42] so I'm not trying
[06:44] to you know point my finger at anyone in
[06:47] particular but if you look around on
[06:49] YouTube there are people out there that
[06:51] try to make a big stink about themselves
[06:54] and they'll try to
[06:56] show results that may or may not be real
[06:59] I'm not here to disparage that they
[07:01] could be actually trading a live account
[07:03] I don't personally care but anyone that
[07:05] trades on think or Swim they can
[07:06] recognize this chart right
[07:08] away I posted a results and updated uh
[07:12] reflection on the Thinker swim or TDM a
[07:15] trade account and it's on my community
[07:18] tab I promise I won't beat you up too
[07:21] much with the community tab but that's
[07:22] my way of reaching out to you so if you
[07:25] subscribe to the channel and then when
[07:27] you subscribe to the channel you want to
[07:29] toggle all notifications you want to
[07:32] click that little uh I think it's like a
[07:34] bell icon and then all notifications
[07:37] that way anytime I post my community tab
[07:39] it'll let you know otherwise it won't
[07:41] let you know so it's it's my replacement
[07:43] to Twitter which in my opinion
[07:46] sucks so if we look at the EB and flow
[07:52] of all this
[07:53] here where the Market's trading up and
[07:57] between here and here
[08:00] it's not a small number of handles it's
[08:03] a pretty respectful amount of handles
[08:06] it's not a couple it's not a handful and
[08:09] then up here it's a reversal and it
[08:12] comes back down and I buy it back here
[08:14] in Reverse so I'm selling short
[08:17] here and I'm buying long
[08:21] here 740 the 720 that's 20 handles going
[08:26] long here at 720 I'm abbreviating the
[08:29] number just for brevity sake getting out
[08:32] at 732 12
[08:35] handles then going along
[08:39] here 756 and then getting out at 784 A2
[08:44] then going short at
[08:47] 798 and covering at
[08:50] 675 so I'll ask you which one of these
[08:53] trades do you think is the one that you
[08:55] want to learn again putting all
[08:57] aside the idea that you you probably
[09:00] want to do all of these but I'm not
[09:02] promising you that okay I'm going to
[09:04] take you
[09:06] into how to find this setup
[09:09] here notice the number of handles I'm
[09:12] not promising you're going to get this
[09:13] many handles but the setups and the
[09:15] logic behind it will help you find these
[09:18] types of Frameworks framework is the
[09:21] foundation to a trading model so you
[09:24] have to have an understanding what is
[09:25] you're looking for and that's really the
[09:27] only thing I'm introducing tonight is
[09:28] the idea of what it is I'm promising to
[09:32] educate you with so that way you can go
[09:34] in and find these setups on your own you
[09:36] will not need to be a slave to some kind
[09:40] of blackbox system you don't need to be
[09:43] a part of some kind of signal generating
[09:46] gimmick you don't need to be a part of a
[09:48] signal service you can find these on
[09:50] your own independent that's exactly what
[09:53] I'm trying to frame in all of my
[09:55] students I do that with my mentorship
[09:56] students that paid me for education now
[09:59] here you are in my YouTube channel I'm
[10:01] telling you the same thing I'm teaching
[10:04] Independence that way you're not
[10:05] requiring any handholding by me once you
[10:08] understand the rules and you go through
[10:09] the processes and things I'm going to
[10:11] teach you how to practice with you will
[10:13] not need anything except for the chart
[10:16] itself that's it and that's how in my
[10:20] opinion and you can argue with this if
[10:22] you want but I could care less if you
[10:23] could any of you would challenge the
[10:25] idea that independent thinking is not
[10:27] the best way of doing it you want to be
[10:29] able to be Unshackled okay and if you're
[10:31] part of a signal service or if you're
[10:33] part of a approach that requires you to
[10:36] use a blackbox system you're kind of
[10:40] held captive aren't you so if you look
[10:43] at this this
[10:45] chart is clean except for these little
[10:48] bubbles actually show you the
[10:50] transactions you don't really get any
[10:53] kind
[10:54] of
[10:57] well distortion from your reading of
[11:01] price action I don't have a lot of
[11:03] graffiti on the chart okay but the main
[11:05] takeaway here is I want you to
[11:06] understand that I don't hunt for three
[11:09] to five handles and consider that
[11:11] legendary okay now can you be profitable
[11:15] if you take high frequency trades and
[11:18] you do those types of Trades absolutely
[11:20] that's what Algos do algorithms do that
[11:23] but I'm trying to show you by contrast
[11:26] that there is a way that you can find
[11:28] setups that are outside that parameter
[11:31] of very small little handles and doing
[11:34] lots of contracts so if you're looking
[11:36] at this here and this was say you're
[11:38] trading and you're trading a NASDAQ
[11:41] micro account you're not making a lot of
[11:44] money on these swings okay I'm not
[11:47] making a lot of money on these swings
[11:49] but I'm able to find these swings and
[11:52] it's not these small little increments
[11:55] okay I'm going to teach you skill sets
[11:58] that Focus primary arily on this okay
[12:01] you want to find a nice price leg
[12:03] intraday I'm not promising you how to
[12:06] buy sell short Buy sell short Buy sell
[12:09] short that's that's mine okay I'm not
[12:13] teaching that and I somebody like oh
[12:15] you're a jerk you're this you're that
[12:16] whatever I didn't promise that that's
[12:18] why I set the stage in the first
[12:20] introduction video so that way we know
[12:22] what it is I'm teaching you if anyone of
[12:25] you here don't want to learn how to take
[12:27] this type of trade you're welcome to not
[12:29] continue and turn this video off and go
[12:30] watch whoever okay but I think if you
[12:35] give it a chance you'll find some
[12:37] amazing things that bring Clarity to
[12:39] reading price
[12:42] action all right so we're looking at the
[12:45] NASDAQ futures March delivery contract
[12:48] and this is a trading view chart and if
[12:50] you've never used tradingview.com the
[12:52] way you would pull this symbol up is
[12:54] NQ
[12:57] h222 okay and and this is a weekly chart
[13:01] and I want you to think about each week
[13:04] before the new trading week begins
[13:06] preferably on the weekend okay the idea
[13:10] is you want to try to get a read on what
[13:11] you think that next weekly candle is
[13:14] going to do is it going to go higher or
[13:16] is it going to go lower you're not
[13:18] trying to predict the close of the
[13:21] weekly candle that's important okay you
[13:23] just want to see before this weekly
[13:26] candle opened up all we had was this IND
[13:29] candle okay do you think that this
[13:32] candle that would have formed and opened
[13:34] here is more likely to go higher or
[13:39] lower obviously with the benefit of
[13:42] hindsight here but I can tell you all of
[13:44] my students know we've been looking for
[13:45] lower prices and I'll just give you a
[13:47] quick short list as the reasons why
[13:49] number one seasonality okay seasonal
[13:51] Tendencies it tends to go down around
[13:53] this time anyway we also have
[13:56] discussions about how the fed's going to
[13:58] raise interest rates stock market does
[14:00] not like that we're also in earnings
[14:02] season there's a lot of volatility
[14:04] because of earnings and those factors
[14:08] plus the underlying tone of the
[14:09] marketplace which I'll show you when we
[14:10] get into the daily chart it
[14:13] just well it's heavy and this is where
[14:16] it was going to draw to okay did I
[14:19] expect this entire range to be delivered
[14:21] in one week no that's not important the
[14:24] point is I'm expecting the weekly candle
[14:27] to expand on the lower end okay okay or
[14:29] go down and gravitate towards this low
[14:32] which it hasn't broken yet but I think
[14:34] that's what we're probably going to aim
[14:35] for on Sunday's opening going into
[14:36] Monday's trading so that's where I think
[14:39] it's drawing
[14:40] to and that's the component I want you
[14:43] to focus on with your analysis what is
[14:45] the market likely to draw to when I say
[14:47] draw to think of it as price being a
[14:53] paperclip okay and then you you have
[14:56] this magnetic impulse that specifically
[14:59] price levels and seasonality okay
[15:03] will put on price it'll cause price to
[15:07] gravitate towards certain levels and the
[15:09] measure of speed and magnitude that it
[15:11] moves to get to these levels you learn
[15:14] that over experience that's not
[15:16] something I can transfer it's something
[15:18] you have to practice and see and study
[15:20] and you get a rhythm for it okay every
[15:22] educator knows what I mean by that and
[15:24] every student that's been trained
[15:25] successfully by any other educator will
[15:27] not understand exactly what I mean by
[15:29] that you just get a feel for it it's
[15:31] experience there's no way of defining
[15:32] outside of
[15:34] that in the early stages of your
[15:36] development you want to at least try to
[15:38] focus your attention on where that
[15:40] Weekly candle is going to do now here's
[15:42] the thing it may start the first half of
[15:44] the week or maybe just one day expand
[15:47] lower and if you get a setup in that
[15:49] that's it you're done that's how you
[15:52] start working towards consistency no
[15:54] student ever should try to trade every
[15:57] single session every single day because
[16:00] the only thing you're doing is building
[16:03] an expectation that you're going to be
[16:04] able to do this every single day
[16:05] profitably and then if you do get a run
[16:08] of profitability soon as you get a
[16:10] losing trade it's going to blow your
[16:12] mind and you're going to want to correct
[16:14] it quickly and you're going to start
[16:16] making irrational decisions and then you
[16:18] enter that loser cycle I've talked about
[16:20] many times in the YouTube channel so the
[16:23] only thing you're looking for is a
[16:25] likely movement higher or lower based on
[16:28] on the weekly candle okay that's all
[16:30] you're
[16:31] doing that sets your initial bias for
[16:34] the
[16:35] week on the daily chart you're looking
[16:37] for swing highs and swing lows to get
[16:38] your liquidity and majority of your
[16:42] trading and the draw on liquidity what
[16:46] makes the market go higher or lower it's
[16:48] predominantly found on this time frame
[16:51] okay so majority of your analysis should
[16:53] really be linked to this time frame
[16:55] right here you have to have an
[16:57] assumption
[16:59] whether you're going to be expecting
[17:00] that Weekly candle to expand higher or
[17:02] lower that's your weekly bi but then you
[17:04] have to go into the daily chart and
[17:06] figure out basically where you are in
[17:08] the grand scheme of things on that
[17:09] Weekly range expanding higher or
[17:12] lower because we're looking for lower
[17:14] prices and we're looking for
[17:16] weakness the expectation is we want to
[17:18] see every short-term
[17:21] low like this would be a shortterm low
[17:23] this will be a short-term low and
[17:25] underneath those lows there's going to
[17:26] be sell stops okay that's liquidity
[17:30] when I say learn to start looking for
[17:33] where the Market's going to draw to it's
[17:35] drawing to one of two things okay it's
[17:39] drawing to stops which is liquidity or
[17:42] it's running to an imbalance now what's
[17:45] that
[17:46] mean above old highs buy stops below old
[17:51] lows sell
[17:53] stops imbalances is something like this
[17:56] over here where we have one single
[17:58] candle pass higher and the previous
[18:00] candle's high is here and the next
[18:02] candle's low is here so it only went up
[18:04] one candle nothing moved down the
[18:06] overlap with that same delivery on that
[18:08] price candle there so in other words
[18:11] that's an imbalance it's only going
[18:13] higher and nothing else is here to
[18:17] offset that and efficiently deliver
[18:19] price on the opposite end now you
[18:22] probably heard of the theory auction
[18:23] Theory okay and folks hear me try to
[18:28] communicate some of these things and
[18:30] they'll run away with oh he's just
[18:31] talking about auction Theory and it's
[18:32] not just like when they see me do a
[18:35] rectangle or a box on chart and you'll
[18:37] see one in this video it's not supply
[18:39] and demand okay it's just what it is
[18:42] you'll see it and you'll know right away
[18:43] after you've been with me for a couple
[18:45] weeks that this is entirely unique and
[18:47] there's nothing else like it and I'm
[18:49] certain majority of you are going to
[18:51] fall in love with this
[18:52] model so we're looking for lower prices
[18:55] we're looking for an expansion I'm using
[18:57] the benefit of hindsight but I can
[18:58] promise you
[18:59] again this was discussed we were looking
[19:01] for lower prices in my paid group and if
[19:03] I did not say that I have a lot of
[19:05] students that are making YouTube
[19:06] channels they are welcome to come out
[19:08] and say I'm a liar so we're looking at
[19:12] the daily chart we're going to drop down
[19:13] into the hourly chart okay now what I
[19:16] have here is a framework for looking at
[19:19] the weekly range on an hourly chart so
[19:21] all I did was beginning on midnight New
[19:24] York time Monday's candle and then
[19:28] Friday's close and in the beginning of
[19:30] Friday's trading at midnight okay now
[19:33] what I'm delineating here is the fact
[19:35] that we had a nice selloff on
[19:38] Thursday and the market went into
[19:39] consolidation
[19:41] overnight notice what happens here on
[19:44] Friday this is that old low in the daily
[19:46] chart that's what we're thinking or
[19:49] assuming that it's going to draw to
[19:51] because that daily chart there's lots of
[19:53] liquidity and large fund Traders large
[19:57] institutional Traders
[19:59] institutional mindset investors will be
[20:03] looking at these old lows and old highs
[20:07] and liquidity providers will be looking
[20:10] to take business in around these same
[20:13] levels so if we know that this level
[20:16] down here is the old daily low and again
[20:19] let me take it back up to the chart on
[20:20] the daily chart that's this low right
[20:22] here okay by dropping down into the
[20:24] hourly chart at levels here all I'm
[20:26] doing is transposing those daily levels
[20:30] right to this hourly
[20:31] chart the entire week has been
[20:34] bearish okay it's been going lower since
[20:36] the beginning then we had consolidation
[20:39] in
[20:40] here the market creates this short-term
[20:43] high in this short-term low what rests
[20:46] above that short-term high if you've
[20:48] taken notes and been paying attention
[20:49] it's buy stops what's resting below this
[20:52] low Here Sell stops watch closely the
[20:57] market trades down initially
[20:59] and takes out the cell stops why would
[21:01] it do that
[21:03] first this is inducing shorts okay so it
[21:06] Engineers liquidity even
[21:10] if the idea is that they want to take
[21:14] the market down to this level if it's
[21:16] been
[21:18] consolidating I like to see them do this
[21:20] type of move here where it drops down
[21:22] first it's kind of like a sucker play
[21:25] anybody has a sell stop below here they
[21:27] want to sell on weakness
[21:29] they're going to get tripped into the
[21:30] marketplace so now they're triggered in
[21:32] short and then they start doing a run
[21:34] against those Traders and against those
[21:38] that were already short from this high
[21:40] so what are they doing the Market's
[21:42] being driven higher and the algorithms
[21:45] going to attack that buy stock liquidity
[21:47] pool why would they want to do that
[21:50] number one it's going to punish those
[21:51] individuals here that went
[21:53] short when it drives Above This High
[21:57] here it sends all those spy stops into
[22:01] Market orders flooding the marketplace
[22:04] that gives a huge influx of willing
[22:08] buyers at a high price which is the
[22:10] perfect counterparty to Smart money that
[22:13] wants to sell at a high price remember
[22:15] the market wants to go down here so when
[22:18] it dries up to here those buy stops are
[22:21] the counterparty or the other side of a
[22:24] smart money Trader that's wanting to go
[22:27] short because they're going to sell
[22:28] short they got to sell it to somebody
[22:30] wants to buy it at a high price that's
[22:32] why the market does this okay in your
[22:35] notes you want to record anytime a
[22:37] significant price move lower is expected
[22:41] always anticipate some measure of a stop
[22:43] hunt on buy stops or a short-term High
[22:45] being taken out obviously it's reversed
[22:48] when you're looking for higher prices
[22:51] generally you'll see a shortterm low
[22:53] taken out and sell stops taken before
[22:55] you see a very pronounced rally High
[22:59] higher don't take my word for it go
[23:01] through your charts and you'll see it's
[23:03] actually occurring almost on a daily
[23:05] basis so we're going to drop down into a
[23:08] 15-minute time frame so that same old
[23:11] low level down here and that high I just
[23:14] mentioned on the hourly chart and the
[23:15] low on the hourly chart is now been
[23:18] defined with a small little line segment
[23:20] okay so we have a trend line here and a
[23:22] trend line here that's the extent of a
[23:24] trend line that's it I only use them to
[23:26] highlight to my students these levels
[23:28] are not on my chart I'm watching a naked
[23:31] chart
[23:32] okay you while you're developing you
[23:35] should have these levels drawn out in
[23:37] your chart because it helps you build
[23:39] and ingrain the idea that this is where
[23:41] liquidity is it keeps you focused on
[23:43] that because it's easy to look at all
[23:45] these candles forming if you have the
[23:47] luxury of watching it in life and you
[23:49] can lose sight of where you are and mean
[23:51] once you lose your bearings it's really
[23:54] confusing and this helps you keep those
[23:56] bearings in mind and what do I mean by
[23:58] that well I mentioned how the market
[24:00] dropped down initially and that takes
[24:02] the sell stops out so sell side
[24:05] liquidity has been attacked Traders are
[24:08] now tripped in going short if they sold
[24:10] on a break trying to be a breakout
[24:12] artist and then the algorithms go right
[24:14] back up to an area where it's been
[24:16] cleanly delivered relative equal highs
[24:19] see how this High here right before it
[24:20] dropped is basically the same high here
[24:23] notice that so retail Traders see this
[24:26] and they trust it as what
[24:29] resistance so the books always say put
[24:32] your buy stop if you're going to go
[24:34] short right above and clear level of
[24:37] resistance well these levels work for a
[24:39] short period of time but majority of the
[24:42] time you see this event right here and
[24:44] this is how I teach my students to go in
[24:45] there and look for those types of events
[24:47] because what did I just tell you a
[24:48] moments ago about looking for
[24:50] significant price moves before there's a
[24:52] significant price move of any real
[24:54] magnitude or
[24:56] importance generally there's going to be
[24:58] a hunt that takes place right before
[25:00] that price delivery occurs so what does
[25:03] it look like you have relative equal
[25:05] highs this high and this High the market
[25:07] goes up when we're what we're expecting
[25:09] lower prices on that Weekly chart we're
[25:11] on the last day of the week it's already
[25:13] been heavy it's weak and the only thing
[25:15] it's been doing is consolidate and the
[25:18] first thing it did was broke out to the
[25:19] downside tripping what traders in a
[25:22] breakout to go short so now they have
[25:25] Traders caught on the wrong side offs
[25:27] side and now they want to take the
[25:29] market up here where those buy stops are
[25:31] going to be resting for those that were
[25:32] smart enough to sell short here or here
[25:36] and didn't get out below here so the
[25:39] larger pool of liquidity is going to be
[25:40] resting here because it's in sync with
[25:43] the downtrend and everybody that was
[25:45] short the day
[25:46] before they seen this High form and once
[25:49] it broke below this low here they all
[25:51] rushed and Trail their stop loss right
[25:53] above that and I understand if you're
[25:56] new and you think well this is easy to
[25:58] explain in hindsight but I want to
[26:00] remind you go back and look at the first
[26:01] slide I showed you those were actual
[26:03] entries that's a live account through
[26:05] thinker swim Charles swab that was the
[26:08] clearing firm that did the broker side
[26:10] of the business okay so I'm not showing
[26:13] you a demo account I'm not showing you
[26:15] paper trading that those were real
[26:17] entries okay they were real reversals
[26:19] the whole business but the main thing
[26:21] was I showed you that larger trade this
[26:23] is going to be the framework that I'm
[26:25] teaching you how to find it okay but
[26:27] this pool of liquidity once this occurs
[26:30] you want to drop down to your lower time
[26:32] frames and start looking for something
[26:33] specific and let's go into those lower
[26:35] time frames and find out what that
[26:37] is okay here's a two-minute chart why a
[26:40] two-minute chart well 2 minute 1 minute
[26:43] or 3 minute or five five minutes still
[26:46] has a lot of room for imbalances to
[26:49] occur underneath that time frame and
[26:51] what do I mean by that the one minute 2
[26:54] minute 3 minute chart tends to be the
[26:58] best for finding the imbalances for
[27:01] indices okay don't take my word for that
[27:03] okay if you're looking for high
[27:04] frequency setups intraday the one two or
[27:07] 3 minute chart are just beautiful they
[27:10] just offer a real good Clarity the
[27:12] reason why because the high frequency
[27:14] trading algorithms are operating on
[27:17] nothing really higher than 3 minutes
[27:19] majority of the time they're like
[27:20] seconds okay 15c 30 second 45 second 60c
[27:25] intervals okay and what they're looking
[27:27] for are these small little imbalances
[27:30] and what does that look like well we
[27:32] have that run on the buy stops here okay
[27:34] remember that old high here the old high
[27:37] here old high here it runs right on
[27:39] through that once this occurs on that
[27:43] higher time frame 15-minute time
[27:45] frame you want to drop down to the lower
[27:47] time frames and I'm using the two-minute
[27:49] chart because this is exactly what I was
[27:50] using to find that imbalance and trade
[27:53] off of it
[27:55] okay the market creates a short-term low
[27:57] here here and then it breaks below that
[28:00] this is key this is called a break in
[28:02] Market structure now the foundations and
[28:05] underlying framework is we're in a
[28:07] market that's what weekly bearish we're
[28:10] expecting that Weekly candle to expand
[28:12] lower it's been expanding all week so we
[28:15] have momentum on our
[28:17] side we have a consolidation that's
[28:20] occurred and we had a pull liquidity
[28:22] engineered with these relative equal
[28:23] highs and the market broke out to the
[28:25] downside first and then they ran on the
[28:28] highs so once it went here we don't rush
[28:31] in there just go short because it went
[28:33] above old highs we're looking for some
[28:36] specific signature that tips its hand to
[28:38] you okay and I promise you when you
[28:40] start going through your charts and it's
[28:41] going to be homework for you you're
[28:43] going to see this occurring almost every
[28:45] single day and if it's not doing it this
[28:47] way it's doing it the opposite direction
[28:48] as a buy okay again don't take my word
[28:51] for it you're going to be flabbergasted
[28:53] you like that flabbergasted when you see
[28:56] how many times this thing forms every
[28:58] single week okay it's many times
[29:01] throughout the intraday charts it
[29:03] creates this type of move but it runs
[29:06] the stops then we have a short-term low
[29:08] and then it breaks below it so now we
[29:10] have a Breakin Market structure okay
[29:12] once this low is broken you're going to
[29:15] look for this little area here that's
[29:17] that imbalance I mentioned in the
[29:18] beginning right so what's happening is
[29:21] the Market's going to go right up inside
[29:22] that area there and that's where you
[29:25] want to sell now if you don't sell there
[29:28] you can drop down to a lower time frame
[29:29] one minute chart if this was a 3 minute
[29:31] chart you can go down to a one minute
[29:32] chart and look for that to occur on that
[29:34] time frame as well and it many times
[29:36] will form if you're looking at a lower
[29:38] time frame like say this was a 5-minute
[29:40] chart and you looked at a one minute
[29:41] chart you'd find one down in here it's a
[29:43] matter of scaling down in your time
[29:45] frames because once you have an
[29:47] underlying premise to the market now
[29:50] likely to go lower it becomes an easy
[29:53] thing to look for these types of things
[29:55] so in your chart once you're developing
[29:59] this idea and and learning it you're
[30:01] going to highlight this candle's low
[30:03] this candle's high and this right here
[30:04] is what I teach my students as a fair
[30:06] value Gap okay you don't have those in
[30:09] books okay you don't have any of that
[30:10] kind of stuff out there it's something I
[30:12] introduced back in
[30:14] 2016 and obviously a lot of people
[30:17] discovered how good it is and they try
[30:19] to make courses with it but I'm going to
[30:22] not touch that right here but the idea
[30:25] is once it go up into that imbalance
[30:27] there and once it does that soon as it
[30:30] enters that
[30:31] area the algorithm that delivers price
[30:36] now some of you may not know what that
[30:37] means and some of you may not even agree
[30:39] with it you may think that this is made
[30:41] up or it's contrived I promise you if
[30:44] you spend time with this you're going to
[30:45] quickly come to the conclusion that
[30:47] there absolutely is an algorithm and
[30:49] it's manipulating the markets every
[30:51] single day every single tick it's
[30:53] completely controlled okay period you're
[30:56] led to believe it's buying and selling
[30:57] pressure now if I go back and use that
[30:59] analogy where it went down here first
[31:01] then go up here some of you may argue
[31:03] see that's the buying and selling
[31:05] pressure no it's not it's liquidity now
[31:07] you may argue and say well we're arguing
[31:09] semantics no I'm telling you what's
[31:11] going on this is the logic this is how
[31:13] these markets book
[31:15] okay once you see these patterns over
[31:18] and over and over again it's very easy
[31:21] to execute on them but the impulse to
[31:23] want to do it the first time you see it
[31:24] because you watch this video that is
[31:27] going to be problematic for you so
[31:29] you're going to have to do a certain
[31:30] number of weeks and months of back
[31:32] testing there's no escaping that you
[31:34] have to do it any skill set any teacher
[31:37] educator system whatever okay whatever
[31:40] they're going to give you there's going
[31:42] to be some kind of growing period where
[31:44] you have to trial and error fix the
[31:47] problems that you have about yourself
[31:49] and I've literally taken your attention
[31:51] to a very specific framework and setup
[31:53] notice that some of you may think I'm
[31:55] still talking too much but I'm taking
[31:56] you right into the heart of the matter
[31:58] this is what it looks like this is what
[32:00] you're looking for okay these are the
[32:02] Fingerprints of that
[32:04] setup these
[32:06] repeat so if you know what they are and
[32:09] what those components are that make up
[32:10] this
[32:11] setup you'll be able to find them but
[32:14] focus on the imbalance after the market
[32:17] structure breaks so this big candle here
[32:19] it breaks
[32:20] down look at the next candle it opens
[32:23] and trades higher and stops right there
[32:25] so from this candle's low and this
[32:26] candle's High when this candle starts
[32:28] trading soon as it opens and it runs
[32:30] right up into that that's a short you
[32:31] can go right in there and sell short be
[32:33] done now where's your stock going to be
[32:37] well you can put it above this High here
[32:40] or you can put it above this candle's
[32:42] High whichever your risk parameters
[32:44] allow for okay um if you're trading the
[32:48] micro which is again it's not a lot of
[32:50] money per tip so the multiplier for that
[32:52] is very very small if you trade the
[32:56] larger full Futures cont cont and if it
[32:58] moves 100
[32:59] points and it can do it real quick it
[33:02] can burn you pretty bad so you may have
[33:05] the leverage to trade with a discount
[33:07] broker okay you may have the initial
[33:09] margin to trade with a discount broker
[33:11] but you may not have the wherewithal and
[33:13] the skill set to navigate this market
[33:15] and that's the only thing I'm trying to
[33:17] provide here as an alternative because
[33:19] there's a lot of individuals outs there
[33:21] that will promote the idea that you can
[33:22] go out there with a discount broker and
[33:24] just clean up yeah if you know what
[33:26] you're doing but you don't need a
[33:29] discount broker to be profitable
[33:32] okay looking at this further we're going
[33:35] to look at the logic in here and I want
[33:36] you to think about after this forms and
[33:39] you see that as your choice setup or
[33:41] entry if it starts to move lower you can
[33:45] still get in it there's no reason not to
[33:48] think that you know you can't get in it
[33:49] here or in here it's close to or in
[33:54] close proximity to where that area is as
[33:56] an entry once we take out a low though
[33:59] once that occurs then it becomes a
[34:02] matter of your chasing price and if you
[34:03] try to get in especially if you like
[34:04] using Market order you may see it trade
[34:07] right to this low and say okay now I
[34:09] believe it's going to go down you put a
[34:10] market order in the sell short then
[34:12] slippage gets you down here that creates
[34:14] a larger area of risk that you have to
[34:16] assume and it's just it's problematic
[34:18] you want to learn to trust going short
[34:19] when the Market's going higher and that
[34:21] feels scary at first but once you start
[34:23] seeing this pattern form it becomes easy
[34:26] to trust it and in in fact that you want
[34:28] to be doing that you want to be selling
[34:30] short expecting lower prices right when
[34:33] the candle's going up and Retail Traders
[34:36] can't grasp that many times it's just
[34:38] like it goes against the logic because
[34:40] they think I got to have confirmation
[34:42] all the books say I have to have
[34:43] confirmation and that's somebody that's
[34:45] coming in late that's someone that
[34:47] doesn't have a read price they can't
[34:49] really follow it and usually they're the
[34:51] people that will trade short with
[34:53] additional shell you know sell stops
[34:55] they'll put sell stops below the
[34:56] marketplace and then that's a momentum
[34:58] entry for them and it's kind of like a
[34:59] no-brainer in fast markets it yeah it
[35:01] works but if you don't know what you're
[35:03] doing you try to do that in a market
[35:05] that's consolidating or about the
[35:06] reverse it hands you your backside okay
[35:10] so if you're looking at this framework
[35:13] here and we've taken the buy stots we
[35:14] have our entry pattern here what would
[35:16] you be looking for as a downside
[35:19] objective well I'm going to teach you
[35:22] the liquidity Matrix okay and sounds
[35:25] pretty cool sounds neat and all that but
[35:27] watch what it is this here is your range
[35:30] this is the low of the day and this is
[35:32] the high of the day thus far so if we
[35:35] take that range and split it from the
[35:36] low to the high to get the midpoint all
[35:39] this can be determined by a simple 50
[35:40] level on a Fibonacci so you drag your
[35:42] Fib from this high down to that low or
[35:44] vice versa and have your 50 level
[35:47] highlighted then anything above that 50
[35:50] level this is referred to from an
[35:53] algorithmic stance as a premium Market
[35:56] it means is expensive now markets can
[35:59] stay in a premium for a while and not go
[36:02] to a discount which would be below the
[36:04] 50 point okay 50% anything down here is
[36:07] a
[36:08] discount if you're bearish if you're
[36:10] ever going short you want to look at the
[36:11] previous range where are you at inside
[36:14] that range so when this formed here that
[36:16] little fair value Gap once that
[36:20] formed you're thinking okay we are in a
[36:23] premium so algorithms will want want to
[36:26] go to a discount that's the opposing
[36:29] side of the marketplace so if it's going
[36:31] short here it's driving the market lower
[36:34] what does that mean the algorithm is
[36:35] going to start pricing lower you can
[36:38] have all the buyers in the world come in
[36:40] if the algorithm is in a sell program
[36:42] and it's going lower it does not matter
[36:44] it's going to repic lower and lower and
[36:46] lower and then what will happen is those
[36:48] buyers that may come in with a huge
[36:49] influx of volume they're going to get
[36:51] crushed and they get squeezed you ever
[36:53] hear that term oh this is a bear squeeze
[36:55] this is a bull squeeze all that is an
[36:58] excuse for them not to know why the
[36:59] algorithm is doing what it's doing
[37:00] that's it that's all it is it's an out
[37:02] okay I'm telling you this is what's
[37:04] really going on so the Market's moving
[37:06] from this premium high this specific
[37:09] entry point to a level below the 50 of
[37:13] this range this low and this high now I
[37:17] want you to again go back and Rewind the
[37:19] video once we're done and look at that
[37:22] execution page where I showed you my
[37:24] entries going back and forth up and down
[37:26] up and down and where I got out at where
[37:28] I got in at okay I want you to think
[37:32] about what below this level here the 50
[37:35] level what is resting below
[37:41] here cell stops so now think about the
[37:45] idea of Someone Like You and I that
[37:47] would see this ideal entry as a short we
[37:50] have to sell to get in that short how do
[37:52] we get out of that short we got to buy
[37:55] it back or cover it by buying
[37:58] well we're going to find willing sellers
[38:00] at a low price relative to this point
[38:02] here they're willing already sitting
[38:04] down there with their sell stops right
[38:06] below that
[38:07] low now look closely what else resides
[38:11] right near that
[38:14] low do you see it pause the video before
[38:17] I show it to you because it kind of
[38:18] ruins the experience because if you find
[38:21] it and I don't tell it it feels
[38:24] good right there is that imbalance I
[38:27] mentioned
[38:28] okay it's only one single candle passing
[38:30] up and the previous candle's High and
[38:32] the next candle's low that area right
[38:34] there is an imbalance from this area
[38:36] here it went down below the 50 level and
[38:39] attacked these cell stops and completely
[38:43] closed in this imbalance so every point
[38:45] of this candle's High to this candle's
[38:47] low that range with the candle only
[38:49] going up that's a by side
[38:54] imbalance it has to have an equal
[38:57] delivery to be efficiently priced and
[39:00] booked by the algorithm it goes down and
[39:03] completely closes it back in with down
[39:05] movement notice the candle on this here
[39:06] it opens and then trades down so it
[39:08] fulfills its role of balancing the buy
[39:11] side offering now the sells side
[39:13] offering so that is an efficiently
[39:15] delivered price
[39:16] move Precision elements from the entry
[39:19] here down to here everything else after
[39:22] that for the rest of the day I didn't
[39:23] care about even though I had an
[39:25] objective of that old daily low I wasn't
[39:28] expecting it to run into it this
[39:32] particular day and that's why I didn't
[39:33] participate anymore the rest of the day
[39:35] in hindsight I wish I would have left a
[39:37] small position on and just let it go but
[39:40] you're going to have that you're never
[39:41] going to be right about everything all
[39:43] the time every single day you're going
[39:44] to leave things on the table you're
[39:46] going to get in too early you're going
[39:47] to hold too long you're not going to buy
[39:49] enough you're not going to sell enough
[39:50] there's always going to be some reasons
[39:52] why you didn't do something right so
[39:53] don't beat yourself up about it okay but
[39:55] if you can find elements like this
[39:56] repeat in the price action can you agree
[39:59] with me that that is amazing precision
[40:03] and this is the logic I used to do that
[40:06] trade the very trade that I showed you
[40:08] that was the largest one in the example
[40:10] of saying which one would you rather
[40:11] learn how to
[40:13] do I basically just handed you an ATM
[40:16] machine
[40:18] okay this repeats every single week
[40:23] every single week now I want you to
[40:25] count the number of the Handles in this
[40:29] move let's say you got in at uh well
[40:32] this say you got in at 800
[40:34] 14,800 it started to go down you trust
[40:37] it okay we're going to go short ideally
[40:40] you want to enter as it goes into that
[40:41] but it's going to take time for you to
[40:42] trust
[40:43] that but let's say you got in at
[40:47] 14,800 if you got out down here like I
[40:49] did I exited as it went right to the top
[40:51] of that range right here this range here
[40:55] that's the top of it once went below
[40:58] that that was it for me that closed the
[41:01] trade is that five handles is that 10
[41:04] handles is that 20 handles is that 30
[41:06] handles is that 50
[41:10] handles
[41:11] no it's over 100 and
[41:14] something
[41:17] now let's assume for a moment that you
[41:20] get good at this or I get the
[41:23] inclination that I want to go to some
[41:25] kind of a deep discount broker
[41:27] and I go in I do trades like this and
[41:29] I'm putting on 15 to
[41:31] 25 full Futures contracts what do you
[41:35] think the results are going to
[41:40] be yep so not everything is going to be
[41:46] easy right away and you're not going to
[41:48] be able to see these things happen just
[41:50] because you sit in front of the charts
[41:52] you have to study and you have to
[41:54] practice and by experience of looking at
[41:56] Old moves and watching real price action
[41:58] as best as you can if you can't watch it
[42:00] live trading view has a replay button
[42:03] where you can watch the candles kind of
[42:05] form but they're they're little stilted
[42:09] because it's not completely painting the
[42:12] candle okay and you can't practice with
[42:15] entering like that you can only just
[42:16] study how price moved and gravitated
[42:19] towards certain levels it's the best
[42:21] thing you can have if you if you at
[42:23] least consider doing that much that's
[42:26] good but if you really want to take it
[42:28] to the next level and say you're running
[42:29] a business or if you're going to school
[42:31] or you have a job and you can't watch
[42:33] the time frame around the opening of the
[42:37] index Futures and I like watching it
[42:40] around 8:30 in the morning New York
[42:42] local time to 11:00 there's usually a
[42:44] setup in there that I'm going to be able
[42:45] to find obviously You' seen I did
[42:47] multiple setups and executions today but
[42:49] the point is this that's like that sweet
[42:51] little spot in the morning that I focus
[42:53] on I teach that in this YouTube channel
[42:56] I teach it in my my paid mentorship
[42:59] group so you're getting real stuff here
[43:02] it's not something that was contrive I
[43:03] didn't just make it up because this day
[43:05] worked out in my favor my students
[43:07] recognize these things also
[43:10] and these are simple elements that
[43:13] repeat what you're looking for is a run
[43:15] on liquidity buy stops or sell stops if
[43:18] you're bearish you're looking for buy
[43:21] stops to be ran then a break-in Market
[43:23] structure lower a short-term low being
[43:25] broken that's what it looks like right
[43:26] here shortterm swing low we have a
[43:28] candle High I'm sorry a candle higher to
[43:31] the left with with its low here then you
[43:33] have the low of this candle and the next
[43:35] candle's higher low than this one so you
[43:37] have a swing low formed if you have that
[43:39] and then you have a break below that if
[43:42] it happens that creates a gap like this
[43:46] that's what you're looking for when it
[43:47] trades up into that you can go short or
[43:49] if you want to use cell stops you can
[43:52] use a cell stop in this candle here and
[43:54] this let it trip you in and then use the
[43:57] high of that candle as your stop that
[43:59] may be too wide for you but I I
[44:01] mentioned the logic around this is
[44:03] you're using a micro okay micros aren't
[44:05] that big of a deal it's not a lot of
[44:07] money okay you're not risking a full
[44:09] Futures leverage it's very very small so
[44:13] if you're looking at these types of
[44:15] setups and you can find them forming
[44:19] repeatedly over and over and over again
[44:21] and you study them you're going to see
[44:24] that you don't need to get these little
[44:26] five handle moves these little 10 handle
[44:29] moves you can make a living doing that
[44:31] don't get me wrong I'm not trying to say
[44:33] that people cannot be profitable and
[44:35] wildly profitable but when you learn how
[44:38] to do something like this and you're
[44:41] able to pull down this number of
[44:45] handles and then you have sound money
[44:48] management nothing compares to it folks
[44:51] these are the things that I use when you
[44:53] watched on when I was on Twitter and I
[44:55] ran up the demo accounts really high
[44:57] these are types of setups I was using
[45:00] these types of setups and as the account
[45:02] grew it was more demo account leverage
[45:05] well I'm not using a demo account right
[45:07] now I'm showing you with a think or Swim
[45:09] and anybody that knows think or Swim
[45:11] when I'm showing you those screenshots
[45:13] the paper trading shows as orange
[45:16] everything on that page is orange when
[45:18] it's a live account it's green okay also
[45:22] here's the rub with a demo account it's
[45:25] just demo demo demo demo okay
[45:27] I am not trying to promote the idea that
[45:31] you're going to get rich notice that
[45:33] account hasn't gone Bonkers it hasn't
[45:35] ran up to a million dollars because this
[45:38] mentorship is to hopefully inspire you
[45:40] to pick up a skill that if you deem it
[45:44] useful and you decide at your own
[45:46] discretion and your own timing and you
[45:48] assume that risk on your own because I'm
[45:50] not going to tell you to do this if you
[45:52] decide to get really good at this and
[45:53] you put money behind it that's a skill
[45:57] set that could I'm not promising but it
[45:59] could alleviate some of the problems
[46:01] with what I believe is coming in terms
[46:03] of financial hardship not just in
[46:05] America but everywhere jobs are getting
[46:07] harder and harder to have the economy is
[46:09] a mess so how do we answer that how do
[46:12] we get another income stream coming in
[46:15] this is in my opinion this is one of the
[46:17] ways that you can at least investigate
[46:18] the idea of doing it all right so I'm
[46:20] going to give you some homework in
[46:22] closing I want you to go through all of
[46:25] the e- mini Futures Contract charts okay
[46:28] just like I showed you here these time
[46:29] frames go back and look at the
[46:31] presentation and see what the time
[46:33] frames I gave you listen to what I gave
[46:35] you in terms of audio
[46:36] commentary that is enough in fact I gave
[46:39] you a ton and it may have your head
[46:42] spinning if you're brand new to me or if
[46:44] you're brand new to technical analysis
[46:46] or trading me feel like man is too fast
[46:49] do not send me an email I promise you
[46:51] the lessons I have planned will help
[46:54] eliminate and answer majority of the
[46:55] things you're going to ask
[46:57] just try to study and keep up with the
[47:00] pace that I'm going to put you through
[47:01] which isn't going to be all that bad
[47:04] but as we progress deeper into the
[47:07] teachings many of the questions that are
[47:09] going to come up or when you start going
[47:11] into the homework assignment where
[47:13] you're looking at old data an intraday
[47:15] chart is anything less than a daily
[47:16] chart so like a 4H hour chart that's
[47:17] intraday 1 hour chart that's intraday 5
[47:20] minute 3 minute 2 minute 1 minute all
[47:22] those time frames are intraday what
[47:25] you're going to be looking for are
[47:27] breaks in Market structure after a pool
[47:28] of liquidity okay buy stops or sell
[47:30] stops have been taken in an opposing
[47:34] direction of your weekly expected range
[47:38] in other words are you expecting higher
[47:39] prices or lower prices on the weekly
[47:40] range so if you're looking for lower
[47:42] prices your focus is on a run above an
[47:45] old high once that forms then you're
[47:48] looking for a break- in Market structure
[47:49] on a lower time frame once that occurs
[47:52] and you have an imbalance that's your
[47:54] trigger okay and then you split that
[47:57] range that was created find out where
[47:59] the 50% is and then if you're selling
[48:02] short you want to find something like an
[48:04] old low or an imbalance to aim for as
[48:07] your Target and you want to get the
[48:09] closest Target don't try to get fancy
[48:12] and say okay well I think it's going to
[48:13] go down to that lowest low and try to
[48:15] use that for your exit because sometimes
[48:17] these markets can deny you that so lwh
[48:21] hanging fruit is how I teach you want to
[48:23] have the easiest Target and then allow
[48:25] the market to
[48:27] go farther and you just not be a part of
[48:29] it it's okay is is 125 130 Handles in an
[48:33] index not good
[48:35] enough I think it's good enough but I'm
[48:38] probably just biased but the homework
[48:40] assignment is again you going through
[48:42] the charts using the logic I framed in
[48:44] this introduction lesson looking for
[48:47] Breakin Market structure I also have
[48:48] lessons in this YouTube channel that
[48:49] talks about Market structure breaks and
[48:51] things like that and then you're going
[48:53] to look for the imbalance in price which
[48:54] is that fair value cap then you're going
[48:57] to determine where an opposing high or
[49:00] low resides than log and back test the
[49:02] number of handles you see in hindsight
[49:04] examples and other words how much did it
[49:06] offer and you're going to get a
[49:08] collection of doing that the next lesson
[49:10] I'm actually going to show you how to go
[49:11] back into the charts and look for them
[49:14] how to log them in your journal and give
[49:18] you more insights about how you can find
[49:19] these setups that repeat every single
[49:21] week okay so again I'm going to build on
[49:24] this foundation in the next episode The
[49:25] Next Episode will will be next Tuesday
[49:27] and the time upload will be 10:00 New
[49:30] York local time hopefully you've enjoyed
[49:32] this one until I'll talk to you next
[49:33] time I wish you good luck and good
[49:34] training
