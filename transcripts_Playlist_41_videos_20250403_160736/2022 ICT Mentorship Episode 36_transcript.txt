[00:08] all right folks welcome back the
[00:10] continuing
[00:12] ict 2022 free mentorship on youtube and
[00:16] i'm taking you into the e-mini s p
[00:18] futures contract for june 2022
[00:22] and i saw questions
[00:24] in previous
[00:25] videos where they're asking
[00:27] about
[00:28] june and we're in the month of may
[00:32] these contracts
[00:33] are delivered
[00:35] by contract month
[00:36] so we're about to
[00:38] in a
[00:39] couple weeks end trading of june
[00:41] contract then we'll roll over into
[00:43] september 2022 contract but we have a
[00:46] couple weeks still
[00:47] trading june
[00:50] toss that in there for no extra charge
[00:52] all right so hourly chart
[00:54] obviously we are looking at
[00:59] a swing low here
[01:01] to swing high
[01:03] getting our range here's equilibrium so
[01:05] the market did in fact drop down into
[01:09] a discount and
[01:13] a pair of a gap
[01:14] so we have a market that is in what
[01:18] an oversold condition do we need an
[01:20] indicator to plot that or determine that
[01:22] nope absolutely not
[01:24] the rectangle is there just
[01:27] to draw special attention for you the
[01:29] viewer
[01:31] the fib is just to highlight exactly
[01:33] where equilibrium is anything above that
[01:35] level would be considered premium
[01:36] anything below it
[01:38] discount so we've
[01:40] moved from this high down
[01:43] into a fear of a gap and below
[01:44] equilibrium so we're in a discount
[01:47] all right here's the five-minute chart
[01:51] and notice that we had this run up in
[01:53] here i mentioned in twitter
[01:56] and again
[01:57] my
[01:59] twitter feed is not a signal service so
[02:01] that way we understand one another
[02:03] but i was highlighting the idea that
[02:06] this was
[02:07] likely to go higher
[02:10] and
[02:11] it needed to go for a premium
[02:13] relative to this high
[02:16] and that low so we moved up into a
[02:18] premium then we slid aggressively taking
[02:20] out relative equal lows so below this
[02:22] low here and here is what sell side
[02:24] liquidity it was quick to do that rate
[02:26] the opening at 9 30.
[02:29] short little bounce
[02:30] then one more time below the low here
[02:32] taking out cell side
[02:34] for anyone that wanted to capture along
[02:36] here
[02:37] they knocked them out
[02:39] then we had a shift in market structure
[02:42] and then
[02:44] rolled up even higher
[02:45] rebalancing all of this
[02:48] drop back down into an area here where
[02:50] we have
[02:52] a five minute
[02:54] pair of a gap
[02:57] trade's not into it
[02:58] i mentioned on twitter
[03:01] that we would likely trade higher and
[03:03] take out the
[03:07] short-term high here
[03:12] and
[03:14] here
[03:16] so imagine the morning high that's this
[03:18] here
[03:19] that was going to be the draw on
[03:20] liquidity and we saw that run here and
[03:22] actually went a little bit higher than i
[03:23] thought it would
[03:24] for the morning
[03:27] ultimately up into a fair bag up here
[03:29] for a really really deep premium
[03:32] from low
[03:33] to high straight up into that and then
[03:36] pull back inside the range between this
[03:38] low and the high
[03:42] so on a one minute chart we're zoomed in
[03:44] here and you can see
[03:46] the morning i did a
[03:48] small trade here i recorded this did a
[03:50] small little vignette shared it on
[03:52] twitter
[03:54] took partials here at the time of
[03:56] posting the tweet
[03:57] and then the limit order getting hit
[03:59] here
[04:00] then
[04:01] the only other trade i had today was
[04:04] waiting for it to drop down to a
[04:05] discount
[04:07] and when it did
[04:08] i went long here had a little bit of
[04:10] heat here not much it was like five
[04:12] handles
[04:13] so
[04:15] bearable
[04:16] stop loss was just below the swing low
[04:18] over here
[04:20] so
[04:22] did it hit it no did it look like it was
[04:24] going to
[04:25] i don't know i wasn't looking at the
[04:26] chart at the moment it happened
[04:28] to trade here i don't care but i ended
[04:31] up coming back up and i mentioned that
[04:32] we would
[04:34] run
[04:36] this high right here
[04:38] because we've taken out the cell stops
[04:40] here after running higher
[04:42] so we had a
[04:44] shift in market structure
[04:46] back here earlier and then we could
[04:48] basically consolidate and drop down to
[04:50] take out the cell stops so anyone that
[04:53] was lucky enough to go along here
[04:55] and wrote it up to here
[04:57] the algorithm drops back down clears the
[04:59] board
[05:00] taking out the cell stops below here
[05:03] i'm buying those cell stops
[05:05] i had a little bit of heat here
[05:07] we rallied and i mentioned that we would
[05:08] start going higher now because we've
[05:10] cleared out the cell stops
[05:12] and
[05:14] going over into the one minute chart
[05:16] with a little bit more detail
[05:19] here's the initial drop now here's what
[05:21] i want to bring to your attention
[05:22] we had a short-term little
[05:24] shift in market structure here and i
[05:25] know some of you see this and you see
[05:27] this one here which one's the shift in
[05:29] market structure well i'm playing the
[05:32] run up here to a premium like i was
[05:34] mentioning on my twitter feed this
[05:35] morning
[05:36] so if this is a range i'm working within
[05:39] the shift in market structure occurs
[05:41] here when it takes out that high
[05:42] drops down into a fair value gap which
[05:44] is what i bought
[05:45] i didn't believe we were going to take
[05:46] out the lows here because we should have
[05:47] done it at 8 30 news it didn't do it so
[05:50] this is deep retracement and then sent
[05:51] it higher to go into a premium right
[05:53] before 9 30 a.m
[05:55] and then they sank it down
[05:57] notice there's no model entry
[06:00] here
[06:01] that's telling okay it's tipping its
[06:03] hand to you
[06:04] because there's no real setup and it's a
[06:06] rush to get down here it's clearing out
[06:08] sales liquidity going down
[06:10] rallying suckering in longs trying to
[06:13] pick the bottom knocking those
[06:14] individuals out
[06:16] now they are not allowed to be
[06:18] long their stops taken
[06:21] nobody in retail usually will take a
[06:23] re-entry after something like that
[06:24] they're afraid
[06:26] it rallies up
[06:28] comes down to a fair value gap
[06:30] shift in market structure here rallies
[06:33] relative equal highs drops back down in
[06:35] very very good order block rallies once
[06:37] more goes into the imbalance here
[06:40] consolidates
[06:42] bumps up just above the short term high
[06:43] here then drops one more time
[06:46] clearing the liquidity out here
[06:49] and you see my entry was at 4120 on five
[06:51] contracts
[06:54] and again here is the tweet
[06:59] okay and i'll have the link posted in
[07:03] the description below this video so you
[07:05] can click and see it and it's time and
[07:06] date stamped
[07:08] that is exactly as you see it here all
[07:11] right so it says salsa liquidity is
[07:12] taken free to run to
[07:15] 43 and a half that's this level here
[07:17] while i was here
[07:19] so
[07:20] continue on
[07:23] first partial which is when i tweeted
[07:25] you can see that in the timeline this
[07:27] morning
[07:28] three contracts were sold at 41 39 and a
[07:31] quarter
[07:33] and finally the final two were filled on
[07:35] a limit order at 41.43 and three
[07:37] quarters
[07:38] and ultimately it wrote a little bit
[07:40] higher which was fine i was juggling
[07:43] a lot of administrative tasks this
[07:45] morning but
[07:46] nonetheless you can see all the trades
[07:47] are here
[07:49] in here
[07:50] so
[07:52] was it a lot now
[07:54] but you know hopefully you guys learned
[07:56] something today we have a non-farm
[07:58] payroll
[08:00] scenario this week its first week of the
[08:02] month
[08:04] transitioning from one month into
[08:05] another
[08:06] and i typically like to have all my
[08:08] trading done by wednesday
[08:10] and because i've done what i've shown
[08:12] here today
[08:13] i'm satisfied with this particular week
[08:16] now some of you are going to be like
[08:18] this is crazy you have wednesday still
[08:20] you have thursday still yeah friday
[08:22] you're welcome to do that but i have to
[08:24] be disciplined and
[08:26] being consistent
[08:29] how you get there is having rules
[08:31] rules and engagement so
[08:33] you're welcome to practice but i'm not
[08:35] trying to hunt anything more this week
[08:37] because
[08:38] frankly it can go either direction it
[08:40] can go higher or lower based on that
[08:41] daily chart so because i don't have a
[08:43] clear definitive
[08:46] objective
[08:47] i'm going to sit on my hands and just be
[08:49] content with what i've shown you all
[08:50] here today
[08:51] and that's going to be it for this week
[08:53] i'm going to be finishing up with my
[08:55] private group i have a lot of things i
[08:56] have to fulfill for them
[08:58] and it means i'll be quiet on twitter
[09:01] and i'll be quiet on
[09:03] youtube until thursday i'll put another
[09:05] video up on thursday evening until then
[09:10] be safe
