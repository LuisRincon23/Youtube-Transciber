[00:06] all right so this is going to be an
[00:08] update to the YouTube channel because
[00:09] there's a lot of people freaking out
[00:11] thinking
[00:12] I'm missing or
[00:15] gone I'm on vacation folks but uh I took
[00:20] the opportunity to sit down here this
[00:22] morning with you and try to hopefully
[00:24] make a mile marker on the equity on this
[00:28] Live account I'm going to try to hit
[00:30] ,000 so I'm watching this potentially
[00:32] make a fair value Gap I want to see that
[00:35] swing High
[00:38] broken let's see if we get that
[00:47] here and again this account is really
[00:49] meant to show like averaging like 20% a
[00:53] month I get questions all the time like
[00:55] you know what do I think a student that
[00:59] has gone through all the teachings have
[01:01] worked out a model you know what could
[01:03] they recently expect to see and what
[01:05] could be done without really pushing the
[01:09] envelope and this is kind of like my
[01:11] answer to that also to kind of like
[01:14] remind everybody I'm not just finding
[01:18] cherry pick trades in AO account I can
[01:21] trade with live funds
[01:23] too all right so we're about to break
[01:26] that swing high if it does that'll be
[01:28] bullish Market structure I'm thinking we
[01:30] can trade back to on the daily chart
[01:32] back to like
[01:33] 14,000 but that's a little bit of a
[01:35] stretch so far
[01:39] intraday okay we have the market
[01:41] structure bullish now so there's a fair
[01:45] value
[01:46] Gap I'll highlight that I'll go into the
[01:49] chart
[01:50] here I'm watching this candle see how it
[01:54] closes because that will complete
[01:57] our imbalance
[02:00] so you can see that right
[02:04] there okay give me
[02:11] another right there that's the low end
[02:14] of the fair value G this thing's always
[02:21] tricky all right so now we have to close
[02:23] of that candle so now I can I'm a little
[02:25] off on that cuz I'm clumsy with uh
[02:33] thinker swim change the color here so
[02:35] you can see a little bit
[02:37] better now it's technically the open so
[02:41] it's a little bit of volatility that
[02:42] comes in here it can overshoot that low
[02:44] I don't care if it does if it goes back
[02:46] up into the fair value capap I will buy
[02:57] it okay now when you're entering on like
[03:00] the opening like 9:30 equities opening
[03:04] uh you could take a long entry here but
[03:07] you don't know how far it's going to
[03:08] whip below that low and you could be
[03:09] wrong and painfully wrong so what I'm
[03:11] watching is does it want to go below
[03:14] that short-term low that's already
[03:15] created moments
[03:17] ago which would be outside and below the
[03:19] fair value Gap and it does not negate
[03:21] the fair value Gap because I'm using
[03:23] narrative narrative is is I expect
[03:26] people to look at that and say okay it's
[03:27] going to go up and they're already
[03:28] trying to buy right now now but their
[03:30] stop loss is going to be below that
[03:32] swing
[03:40] low so sell stops are resting at
[03:45] 13,612 they just took those now now this
[03:48] is a high-risk entry long there but I'm
[03:50] watching price now entering that same
[03:53] fair value got so one more time to see
[03:56] if it wants to poke a little bit lower
[04:01] and I'm again my daily bias is bullish
[04:03] so I'm looking for higher prices so I'm
[04:06] going to go and aim for the 80 level
[04:10] that'll give me a nice figure to run to
[04:13] 50,000 on Equity I do believe it's going
[04:15] to go higher but I'm on vacation so I
[04:16] want to kind of like let me take this
[04:18] long
[04:22] entry and there you go all right so now
[04:25] I'm
[04:27] watching price
[04:32] and I want to see it expand up now
[04:35] because it's the opening and I don't
[04:37] know where if we whip below that low
[04:41] I'll give it a chance to go below it
[04:44] just by a little bit and I'll close it
[04:46] at
[04:46] Market generally I like to trade with a
[04:49] stop loss but if I'm trading the open
[04:50] like this stops can be taken really
[04:53] really easily and then reverse and then
[04:55] never give you a chance to be in it so
[04:56] I'm allowing myself a little bit of
[04:58] flexibility
[05:00] I'm not trying to encourage you to trade
[05:02] without a stop LX believe me I'm I'm
[05:03] right here ready to click and close it
[05:05] if it trades below
[05:09] it and I want to see to expand
[05:16] up now I want to see an energetic run
[05:19] above the swing high that was formed
[05:22] just to the left of where we are right
[05:25] now there is a fair value Gap at the
[05:30] 680 level and it's above equilibrium so
[05:34] it would be a premium market so that's
[05:36] why I'm going to be targeting the 80
[05:39] level plus it's around 50 handle so that
[05:42] gives me about $1,000 or
[05:45] more all right so now right now at this
[05:48] moment I want to see it expand
[05:50] aggressively not you dilly dally around
[05:53] I want to see it really try to spread
[05:55] its wings and take off and start moving
[06:09] there's a small little fair value Gap in
[06:11] the last three candles up I don't think
[06:14] it needs to fill that in or even revisit
[06:16] it but if it were to I would expect
[06:18] price to be you know supported by that
[06:22] so other words not going below the 630
[06:25] level
[06:42] okay now at this moment I could put the
[06:45] stop loss on at my entry and if it takes
[06:49] me out then I'm would basically move to
[06:52] the sidelines and wouldn't take any more
[06:53] trades today because it's F1 see
[06:59] and FC you can trade in the morning but
[07:01] you got to be done
[07:05] early if you're trading
[07:09] equities it's important to be aware of
[07:11] the economic calendar because we're
[07:13] probably going to have a lot of
[07:14] volatility later on today I still think
[07:15] they'll push it higher with that so
[07:19] here's my limit order I'm going place it
[07:21] there and we'll see if we can get this
[07:24] puy to reach up there and grab it I mean
[07:25] I feel confident it's going to go way
[07:27] beyond that but short little Scout out
[07:30] very little draw down about three
[07:31] handles of draw down if that from the
[07:37] entry or the the candle I entered I want
[07:39] to say it that way the low from my entry
[07:43] was only like three handles
[07:45] below I have to have to go watch the
[07:47] video and see what the actual draw down
[07:49] was from the point of entry I'm not sure
[07:51] if I had any if I did then that's what
[07:53] it was limited to 60 bucks or
[07:56] so not bad if you're trying to make
[07:58] $1,000
[08:06] had a small little Scout early in the
[08:14] morning all right
[08:18] and now this is where neight Traders or
[08:21] newbies they get
[08:26] nervous hit the wrong thing here I
[08:29] always
[08:31] think I'm on the other platforms I use a
[08:33] trade station and I use trading View and
[08:36] it's different settings and different
[08:38] things you can look for all right so
[08:41] there's my fill on the limit order
[08:43] rounding out the day and the month of
[08:46] March I will not be taking any more
[08:47] trades this month so $1,255 on two
[08:50] trades about $15 or so in commissions so
[08:54] take that off of there that will be the
[08:55] net for the day I'll take you over to
[08:57] the monitor tab here after I scrunch
[09:00] this up and show you the the run on the
[09:03] price now I think it's going to go
[09:04] higher but here's the monitor tab
[09:05] showing the actual trades today and you
[09:07] can see the profit and loss since I
[09:10] started this account and the commissions
[09:13] which are high because I did a lot of
[09:14] latency tests and I've done a lot of
[09:16] things that would kind of like mimic
[09:18] what a new Trader would do once they get
[09:20] into live fund trading
