[00:10] all right folks welcome back
[00:13] this lesson i'm going to talk about
[00:15] the
[00:16] idea of multiple setups inside of the
[00:19] trading sessions so there's a morning
[00:21] session and there's a pm session when
[00:23] you're working with the new york
[00:25] index features
[00:27] if you look at the
[00:29] market in terms of
[00:31] a split day
[00:33] the new york lunch hour between noon
[00:36] and 1 o'clock p.m new york local time
[00:41] 8 30 in morning
[00:42] to noon that's essentially the morning
[00:45] session
[00:47] there can be multiple setups inside of
[00:49] that now some of the things i've noticed
[00:50] in
[00:51] the comment sections of the videos
[00:54] some viewers and students are asking
[00:58] what do i mean by multiple setups like
[01:00] what does it look like
[01:02] and i kind of want to touch a little bit
[01:03] on that tonight
[01:05] also i want to
[01:07] give you a little bit more perspective
[01:09] on how you can look for additional ways
[01:11] of trading
[01:12] what it is i'm sharing here if we look
[01:14] at the
[01:15] s p futures mini contract for june 2022
[01:19] you can see we recently traded up
[01:22] above the relative equal highs
[01:24] so
[01:25] buy stops and buy side liquidity were
[01:27] resting right above here
[01:29] so as the market drove above that we
[01:31] always have the likelihood of seeing it
[01:33] continue going higher
[01:35] but whenever it goes above
[01:37] relative equal highs and then we get a
[01:39] swing high like this that being the high
[01:41] here
[01:42] lower than the higher candle here and
[01:44] the next candle after this candle it has
[01:47] a lower high as well so it's
[01:50] a swing high not to be confused with a
[01:53] fractal
[01:54] that's used like an mt4
[01:57] okay that
[01:58] is not what i'm talking about okay that
[02:01] takes more candles to make it and by
[02:04] then five candles later it's just
[02:06] you've already missed the move
[02:09] so swing high here since this candle
[02:10] closes the next day i'm looking for
[02:13] something to create an opportunity to go
[02:15] short
[02:16] so we could be anticipating a open here
[02:18] rally power three which is what i
[02:21] already taught on the youtube channel
[02:23] the accumulation manipulation
[02:25] distribution
[02:27] and then
[02:28] incorporating
[02:31] the next level of analysis which is
[02:35] understanding whether we're going to be
[02:36] in a premium or discount market now
[02:38] obviously we're on a premium market
[02:39] we're above old highs here we really
[02:41] stretched out on the outside
[02:44] from this high if we start to go lower
[02:46] this down close candle is your bullish
[02:48] order block
[02:49] okay
[02:51] the idea of it trading into that down
[02:53] closed candle once it goes above these
[02:55] highs that's favorable that's something
[02:57] that could potentially happen
[02:59] now obviously i have the benefit of
[03:01] hindsight here but i promise you if you
[03:03] if you study what i'm teaching you
[03:06] you'll see this repeating okay
[03:09] so the market does in fact trade down
[03:11] into this down closed candle that is
[03:13] your bullish order block but i want to
[03:14] go inside this particular day here which
[03:16] is obviously friday
[03:19] and we're looking at
[03:21] the internals behind what it is i'm
[03:24] trying to teach you and how you can find
[03:25] multiple setups inside of each
[03:28] respective session the morning session
[03:30] and the pm session
[03:34] all right so here is the hourly chart on
[03:36] the s p futures mini contract for june
[03:38] 2022
[03:39] and i kind of like wanna
[03:41] bring your mindset back into what we're
[03:43] looking for
[03:45] and that is
[03:47] the power three we're looking for an
[03:49] expansion move direction higher or lower
[03:52] in this case we're looking for it to go
[03:53] lower
[03:54] because we have
[03:56] the daily bullish order block level that
[03:58] line here
[03:59] level 4504
[04:01] and look at the lay of the land okay
[04:04] what is it that we see also in the price
[04:06] action well go to the left you can see
[04:08] we have a relative equal lows we have
[04:09] this low
[04:11] and we have this low here so they're
[04:13] relatively equal not exactly that's why
[04:15] i named them relatively equal lows
[04:18] the idea of liquidity resting below here
[04:21] by itself without the order block is
[04:23] likely but it's further
[04:25] likely
[04:26] if we have a discount array which is
[04:29] that bullish order block on the daily
[04:30] chart
[04:32] so we have multiple factors here leading
[04:34] to the likelihood of this area being
[04:36] probed for
[04:38] the purpose of pairing liquidity the
[04:40] cell stops basically being rated
[04:44] initially in the morning we were seeing
[04:45] the market trade higher higher higher
[04:47] higher
[04:48] and then
[04:49] we broke lower attacking the sell side
[04:51] liquidity here and then aggressively
[04:53] running into the daily bullish order
[04:54] block
[04:57] i want you to take a look at this
[04:58] framework from this high down this low
[05:00] and this being a fulcrum point that
[05:02] being
[05:03] if this high trades
[05:06] to this low and we break this low how
[05:08] far can we go down i'm going to touch on
[05:10] that in the next slide but for right now
[05:12] i want you to think about how the
[05:14] opening price what's the opening price
[05:17] well there's two
[05:19] if you're trading index futures the
[05:20] opening price is midnight at new york
[05:22] time
[05:24] and that's this candle here that's the
[05:25] opening price here and then there's
[05:27] another opening price at 8 30 in the
[05:29] morning the opening price
[05:32] in the candle that begins 8 30. it
[05:35] doesn't matter what candle you use i see
[05:37] a lot of questions popping up about that
[05:39] like what's the opening price and what
[05:40] can we use
[05:42] as soon as you have
[05:43] 8 30
[05:45] beginning a new candle it could be a one
[05:47] minute candle it could be a three minute
[05:49] candle
[05:50] an hourly candle 15 minute candle
[05:53] whatever that opening price is that's
[05:55] what you want to note at 8 30.
[05:58] so if you're bearish
[06:00] ideally you want to see
[06:02] the market trade above that opening
[06:03] price this is going to be manipulation
[06:06] okay
[06:07] the manipulation is the running above
[06:11] a key level when we are bearish we're
[06:13] expecting this to go lower
[06:15] all of this is basically
[06:17] market protraction where it's a judas
[06:19] swing okay the market's going in the
[06:22] opposing direction that it's likely to
[06:23] go to
[06:24] later in the day so later in the day we
[06:27] expect this to go lower where is it
[06:28] going to go below this low if it
[06:30] accelerates below this low where could
[06:32] it go
[06:33] below here okay then we have the bullish
[06:34] order block on the daily chart so we
[06:36] have a lot of things coming together
[06:38] that draw on a great deal of
[06:41] probabilities
[06:42] now probabilities are not
[06:45] absolute
[06:46] guarantees okay that that's not the case
[06:48] in trading if that was the case i would
[06:50] never take a losing trade you would
[06:51] never take a losing trade we wouldn't
[06:52] need you stop losses and be great but
[06:55] unfortunately
[06:56] we have to contend with risk
[06:59] that being the case
[07:00] we have to at least
[07:02] build the idea around the likelihood of
[07:05] a scenario unfolding but
[07:07] being prepared
[07:09] if it doesn't
[07:10] so
[07:12] if this market is opening
[07:14] here at midnight and it starts to rally
[07:17] we can anticipate this selling off but
[07:19] if it can sell off from here and trade
[07:21] below this low
[07:23] how much further can it go below these
[07:25] relative equal lows obviously we have
[07:27] the daily bullish order block level here
[07:29] right here
[07:31] now let me take you back up real quick
[07:33] that's this level here the opening price
[07:35] on this down close candle that's the
[07:37] order block
[07:38] extending that line out in time you end
[07:40] up with this on the hourly chart so we
[07:43] drop down into that level and look at
[07:45] the reaction there it's nice isn't it
[07:47] so
[07:48] going below this low that's the initial
[07:50] target then reaching below the relative
[07:51] equal lows over here because that's
[07:53] where cell cell equity is going to be
[07:54] residing then tapping into that bullish
[07:57] order block on the daily chart
[08:00] but how much further can we go below
[08:02] that level
[08:05] how far
[08:06] beyond the actual order block level
[08:08] can we go
[08:11] well i'm going to zoom in on a 15-minute
[08:13] time frame i've already taught this in
[08:15] other lectures but i want to revisit it
[08:17] here because
[08:18] this is what you're looking for when
[08:20] you're doing your analysis when
[08:21] everything starts to show a willingness
[08:23] to want to go lower how do we know it's
[08:24] going to go lower well we have the swing
[08:27] low here
[08:28] decisively broken see that this low
[08:31] broken heart
[08:33] then we trade back up into the imbalance
[08:35] here so the fair value gap we trade up
[08:36] into it here at this point we anticipate
[08:39] the candles
[08:40] past this or the new forming candles to
[08:43] trade lower and trade below this low and
[08:46] if it does go below this low we're
[08:47] looking at this price point here that
[08:49] low as a fulcrum point
[08:51] that being
[08:53] measuring this high down to that low
[08:55] that same measurement of
[08:57] distance and we expect that projected
[09:00] lower
[09:01] okay so this is my swing trading model
[09:04] and i'm applying it to targeting
[09:06] so the way you do it is you take your
[09:07] fibonacci and you anchor it to the
[09:09] highest
[09:10] body it could be open or closed it
[09:12] doesn't make a difference
[09:14] but you anchor it on that notice i'm not
[09:15] putting on the high here
[09:17] and i'm doing the same thing with the
[09:18] lowest open or closed in this swing low
[09:22] this retracement up
[09:24] i'm measuring
[09:26] the distance in terms of range
[09:28] with the bodies of the candles the first
[09:30] time i taught this on youtube i had a
[09:32] lot of folks scratching their head and
[09:34] many trolls saying he doesn't even know
[09:36] how to use a fib
[09:39] i'm showing you how the algorithm is
[09:41] going to read the price okay the wicks
[09:45] and the tails
[09:46] are all distractions
[09:49] that's all going to be
[09:51] largely attributed to what the
[09:53] if you're especially if you're trading
[09:54] with 4x and obviously i'm aware that
[09:57] this is not 4x but
[09:59] i learned this through
[10:02] the models that i employ with
[10:06] forex
[10:07] now it's a carryover in terms of
[10:09] analysis because you can apply it here
[10:10] as well
[10:12] it wasn't always like this
[10:15] when there was open outcry only and
[10:17] there was no electronic trading this
[10:19] wasn't
[10:20] as pure as you're going to see and has
[10:22] it's been shown in the past by me in
[10:25] other videos and examples but
[10:27] by having a measurement from the highest
[10:29] body in this swing up in this swing low
[10:33] the lowest body that means the lowest
[10:35] open or closed okay i'm anchoring the
[10:37] fib on that
[10:39] the settings on the fibonacci i have
[10:41] included here and these are the ones
[10:43] that's highlighted for this
[10:45] illustration so below this low we're
[10:47] looking for it to run into sell side
[10:50] so if it goes below this low and
[10:53] aggressively expands lower
[10:55] this could be your next target 45
[10:57] 14 and a half
[10:59] if it goes below this one
[11:01] we can anticipate it trading down to
[11:03] what
[11:04] 45 0 1 and a quarter
[11:07] now the question you're going to
[11:08] probably have in your mind is okay this
[11:10] is all fine and great but how do we know
[11:12] which one to pick ict if you put a
[11:14] thousand lines on your chart ict
[11:16] eventually they're gonna somebody's
[11:17] gonna see one of those levels get hit
[11:20] and then you're gonna make a video and
[11:21] say see how smart i am
[11:25] i've seen all of your arguments i've
[11:26] seen that kind of stuff tossed around in
[11:28] the forums and such so
[11:30] if we look at the idea that
[11:32] that 45 04 and a quarter
[11:35] is just below what level
[11:38] that daily bullish order block
[11:40] at 4504
[11:43] well
[11:44] at 4504 and we're getting a measurement
[11:46] down here
[11:47] that means we could see it trade down to
[11:49] that level here now if you look up here
[11:51] at this level right there that low is
[11:55] exactly the candles low right there
[11:57] don't take my word for it go over to
[11:59] trading view
[12:00] pull up the june contract for 2022
[12:03] e-mini s p
[12:05] that is your daily low
[12:07] you can't predict daily highs and lows
[12:09] ict
[12:10] that's impossible
[12:11] well
[12:13] it is possible if you understand the
[12:15] elements that these algorithms operate
[12:16] under and my question to you is can you
[12:19] get any better than that
[12:22] is there any other measurement
[12:24] in terms of precision that gets you any
[12:27] closer to forty five zero one and a
[12:28] quarter
[12:30] not when the low is forty five
[12:33] zero one and a quarter
[12:36] look at the reaction there now the order
[12:38] block level is just right here
[12:41] but it stabs down into
[12:43] what the algorithm is going to measure
[12:45] so there's the order block it wants to
[12:47] go down to it anyway there's relative
[12:49] equal lows it knows there's liquidity
[12:50] down there and you have the measurement
[12:53] so the precision element is only going
[12:55] to be beneficial if you have all the
[12:57] other narrative incorporated with your
[13:00] analysis that being the market's likely
[13:02] to go lower
[13:03] because we ran out those relative equal
[13:04] highs on the daily chart
[13:06] we created this swing high we broke
[13:08] lower aggressively we're likely to trade
[13:10] in that daily bullish order block then
[13:12] we have this retracement here
[13:14] it completely closes in all the
[13:16] imbalance that's between this low and
[13:18] this high of that candle it rebalanced
[13:21] all that and then
[13:23] we roll over here's that gap i mentioned
[13:26] trades up into that we anticipate what
[13:28] the candles after this candle closes
[13:30] we want to see acceleration to the
[13:32] downside we get it
[13:34] the market starts working lower lower
[13:37] and finally right on a dime
[13:41] that candle
[13:43] is that low
[13:45] and that's your swing projection i teach
[13:47] in this youtube channel
[13:49] you will not get that measurement
[13:51] if you use this swing high in that swing
[13:54] low
[13:55] that's why everybody that uses fibonacci
[13:58] struggles
[13:59] oh fibonacci is a joke
[14:01] it's not a joke
[14:03] if you are doing the measurements
[14:05] correctly now these are just
[14:08] targets but they are more meaningful
[14:10] when you apply and layer other things in
[14:13] analysis
[14:14] like the purpose of running to liquidity
[14:16] below those relatively equal lows into a
[14:18] discount array which is the bullish
[14:21] daily order block
[14:23] when you bring that together you get
[14:25] these types of results which is
[14:27] perfection there's nothing better than
[14:30] this folks you cannot improve upon
[14:32] perfect
[14:36] all right so
[14:37] taking this a little bit further now
[14:38] we're into a 15 minute time frame
[14:40] the opening price again
[14:42] is this candle here which is midnight
[14:45] new york time
[14:46] the opening price
[14:48] that candle you extend that out in time
[14:51] if you're bearish
[14:53] and you are looking at your daily chart
[14:55] because the majority of your analysis
[14:56] should be framed on your daily chart
[14:58] where is it likely to go where is the
[14:59] expansion likely to
[15:01] take price higher or lower that's the
[15:03] main thing you're trying to look for
[15:04] because that's going to carve out your
[15:06] bias
[15:07] so if you know that the likelihood of
[15:09] price
[15:10] wanting to draw down this daily bullish
[15:11] order block
[15:13] and we have that level of 4501 and a
[15:15] quarter which is that candle's low we
[15:18] don't need to have that yet
[15:19] but we know that this is going to be a
[15:21] draw on liquidity because it's also
[15:23] below those relative equal lows that i
[15:24] mentioned when we're looking at the
[15:26] higher time frame chart
[15:28] so all of this here is a build up into
[15:32] the premium
[15:33] the market then breaks aggressively what
[15:35] does it create here
[15:37] what happened
[15:38] here we had a displacement down did that
[15:42] take out that swing low yes
[15:44] does it trade up into that imbalance
[15:46] right here
[15:47] yes
[15:48] does it trade above the opening price
[15:51] yes
[15:52] how many boxes did we just check off
[15:53] there a whole lot
[15:55] probabilities are now going through the
[15:57] roof that this is bearish
[15:59] then the market breaks lower trades down
[16:02] to the old swing low sell side liquidity
[16:04] resting below there watch what happens
[16:06] we trade down through it
[16:08] and then we aggressively rebalance
[16:10] all this down move we come right back up
[16:13] into it bearish order block
[16:15] then sells off another wave into this
[16:17] short term low deeper below this low
[16:20] and into eventually
[16:22] into the lunch hour and passed it
[16:25] for the daily bullish order block
[16:27] now when you look at
[16:29] this type of price action
[16:32] you might not see that as an entry but
[16:34] it is taught to you in this mentorship
[16:37] on youtube that is the lesson right here
[16:40] because if you look back here we have
[16:41] these highs
[16:42] we trade above it
[16:44] does it break below
[16:46] it does does it give them a balance yes
[16:48] does it trade up in here on the 9 30
[16:50] opening yes
[16:52] and then does it run where we want it to
[16:54] liquidity
[16:56] and discount array in the form of a
[16:57] bullish order block yes
[16:59] but
[17:00] what other setups are here
[17:03] because i mentioned
[17:04] in my
[17:07] real money real results series where i
[17:08] was showing actual live account results
[17:10] and proving that these things make money
[17:12] not just in demo
[17:14] and by the way i appreciate all the
[17:16] feedback i'm getting in the commentary
[17:18] section of each video in the comment
[17:19] section
[17:20] but
[17:22] i've read a lot of the questions about
[17:25] you know
[17:26] what do i mean by having no more than
[17:28] four trades two trades in the morning
[17:30] two trades in the afternoon what did i
[17:32] mean by that because i read one guy he
[17:35] was saying i can't even find you know
[17:38] four examples of this and i may not be
[17:40] saying this correctly but you can't find
[17:41] that many examples of it forming over
[17:43] the course of a week let alone a few
[17:46] times in intraday so we're going to walk
[17:48] through
[17:49] today's price action and show it
[17:51] with clarity
[17:54] all right so here's the opening price
[17:55] again on a five minute chart here's the
[17:57] 15 minute time frame fair value gap and
[18:00] the market trades right back up into it
[18:02] about the opening price that's what it
[18:03] would look like on a 5-minute chart
[18:04] notice it does not look
[18:07] clean
[18:08] like it does on the 15-minute timeframe
[18:10] let's go back up one more time
[18:12] see the gap here and that run right
[18:15] there at 9 30.
[18:16] that
[18:18] coupled
[18:20] with this time frame
[18:22] you probably wouldn't see that as a cell
[18:24] you would want to see this filled in
[18:27] but you got to look at the higher time
[18:28] frame the higher time frame 15 minute
[18:30] time frame is providing you the
[18:32] framework it's giving you context that
[18:34] okay this is all we need we don't need
[18:37] it to trade up into that
[18:39] it could
[18:40] but we don't need it to
[18:42] so when it trades up there
[18:44] then it starts to break down
[18:46] it rebalances
[18:47] breaks down again
[18:50] works into that short term low
[18:53] sells off again
[18:54] retracement sells off again
[18:57] in here
[18:58] this is your entry at the opening so in
[19:00] the morning session you typically have
[19:03] two to three setups because you have
[19:05] volatility coming in at the opening
[19:07] opening being 9 30
[19:09] new york local time
[19:11] that can be very tricky if you're not
[19:14] really sure what you're doing
[19:17] you can get caught up in the initial
[19:18] volatility and offside real quick and it
[19:21] can run against you aggressively and
[19:22] hurt you
[19:24] i prefer
[19:26] to see
[19:27] my students look for the initial move
[19:30] to kind of like qualify what you're
[19:32] expected lower prices right so does it
[19:34] give it here yes it does so how can you
[19:36] participate in something like that and
[19:38] still
[19:39] have the bias behind you and have
[19:42] multiple setups that you can take well
[19:44] let's take a closer look on the lower
[19:45] time frame
[19:46] here's the one minute chart here's that
[19:48] return back up into the fair value gap
[19:49] in the 15 minute time frame and wasn't
[19:51] so clear with the five minute but now
[19:54] look what we have here
[19:55] small little imbalance there that fair
[19:57] value gap right above a short term high
[19:59] we trade up into that there
[20:01] on a one minute chart you would see that
[20:04] as a setup for the one minute chart
[20:09] before i go any further
[20:11] i want you to pause the video
[20:14] i know some of you don't like to do this
[20:16] because you just want to get through it
[20:17] you're watching the video at two times
[20:19] the speed because i talk slow
[20:21] this is the time when you want to stop
[20:24] slow down because you will cheat
[20:26] yourself
[20:27] out of learning
[20:28] this is the little moments like when i'm
[20:31] teaching my private group
[20:33] these are these opportunities if you
[20:35] waste them
[20:36] you do not learn
[20:39] the best way okay there's a good there's
[20:41] a good way of learning and there's the
[20:43] best way of learning and the best way is
[20:45] actually participating not just casually
[20:47] watching don't netflix binge watch ict
[20:49] this is where you stop the video
[20:52] ask your spouse or whatever this give
[20:54] you a couple minutes to focus
[20:56] undisturbed that way you can pull out
[20:59] the things i'm trying to show you in
[21:00] this lesson otherwise it's just another
[21:02] you know event where i'm talking about
[21:04] hindsight but what i'm showing you here
[21:07] is something that repeats every single
[21:10] day
[21:11] this is how i can go in every single day
[21:13] and take money out of the marketplace i
[21:15] took the live account up another
[21:17] thousand dollars today so we're over
[21:18] fifty one thousand dollars and
[21:21] these are the types of setups that you
[21:22] can do you can find these and you don't
[21:24] have to have the absolute perfect entry
[21:26] at the opening you don't need that
[21:28] okay that's the benefit of what i'm
[21:30] sharing here publicly i want you all to
[21:33] have the ability to feed yourself and
[21:35] your own family
[21:37] not to rely on a job
[21:40] if you look for these types of setups
[21:42] with this logic i am confident
[21:45] that you can do what i just said
[21:47] and those that really want to
[21:48] supercharge it
[21:49] can take it way beyond that competitions
[21:52] you know whatever
[21:55] but we have the logic here that's that
[21:56] old short term low all i did was extend
[21:58] the line out because it doesn't exist in
[22:00] the chart over here because
[22:02] i don't have enough of the data showing
[22:04] but that short term low that was a
[22:05] fulcrum point remember
[22:07] that's this low here
[22:08] so
[22:09] i'm referencing that zone that there's
[22:11] where the sell side liquidity is
[22:13] but i want you to pause the video and go
[22:14] through this price action and find the
[22:17] setups that you would see as a shorting
[22:19] opportunity if your bias was in line
[22:21] with what i'm suggesting here as it
[22:23] should have been being bearish
[22:30] okay i'm gonna continue the conversation
[22:33] if you are not ready you've missed your
[22:35] opportunity
[22:37] all right so the first fair value gap
[22:39] here
[22:41] right there because we have this short
[22:43] term low
[22:44] broken
[22:45] with the run lower so there's
[22:47] displacement there obvious displacement
[22:50] very energetic and we have this candle
[22:51] is high this candle is low and the
[22:53] market returns back up into it you can
[22:55] go short there
[22:56] and look for what's the first objective
[22:58] that fulcrum point that short term low
[23:01] aim for the liquidity so your target
[23:02] would be there
[23:03] so you could do like say you did two
[23:05] contracts entry here
[23:07] short here too you can take one off here
[23:10] let it ride and then see if you can get
[23:12] that lower time frame objective later in
[23:14] the day
[23:15] now i don't want to take entries during
[23:17] the lunch hour between noon and 1
[23:18] o'clock but you can take profits if
[23:21] you're doing like a partial like you did
[23:23] one here
[23:24] i'm sorry if you did two short contracts
[23:27] here you took one off at your first
[23:28] target and you want to see if you can
[23:29] get the other objective if you have a
[23:31] limit order at the order block level
[23:33] plus you know a couple points
[23:36] it could feel during the lunch hour you
[23:38] don't need to be babysitting it being in
[23:39] front of it then because you've already
[23:41] funded your position and trade by taking
[23:43] one off them here off and moving your
[23:45] stop to break even and to see what it
[23:47] can yield in terms of the daily range
[23:52] next one is here
[23:53] another short term low taken
[23:56] fair value got there we trade back up
[23:58] into it that's a short
[23:59] you can go short here and again same
[24:01] premise looking for the first run below
[24:03] here that will be your target taken
[24:05] there if you did multiple contracts you
[24:07] would get short here take two take one
[24:09] off
[24:10] this might scare you
[24:12] not so much probably if you were short
[24:14] from up here but here could be a little
[24:16] bit intimidating but if you've taken one
[24:19] of the contracts off below here even if
[24:22] it were to come back up and take you out
[24:23] and stop you out
[24:25] the first contract allows you to be
[24:26] profitable so it kind of balances things
[24:29] out
[24:32] another one is here we have the
[24:34] imbalance here
[24:36] after
[24:37] we aggressively move lower and then
[24:39] retrace back up in this is why i'm
[24:41] saying that that previous short if i was
[24:44] short from here i wouldn't be worried
[24:45] about this one so much because your stop
[24:47] would be above here
[24:48] now it got close to it
[24:50] but i've been many trades over the years
[24:52] where it moved within a quarter of a
[24:54] point
[24:55] without stopping me out
[24:57] and
[24:58] you know it's it's a scary feeling
[25:00] especially you have a lot of size behind
[25:02] your positions at the time you're in the
[25:03] trade but
[25:05] it's still a little intimidating because
[25:07] if you
[25:07] completely fulfill
[25:09] your model and follow it in all the
[25:12] roles and you don't want to move your
[25:13] stop and you just allow the stock to be
[25:15] taken there's been many instances in my
[25:17] own trading where within a quarter point
[25:19] it doesn't stop me out it's not like 4x
[25:22] these markets a little bit more
[25:23] professional
[25:24] in the sense that they're much more
[25:26] precise and uniform in the delivery you
[25:29] don't get these wild erratic little
[25:31] spikes and spreading you know of the
[25:33] price action because
[25:35] everybody's working with the same price
[25:36] here
[25:37] versus in forex
[25:39] you're trading within a pool of
[25:41] liquidity
[25:42] within your broker's in-house
[25:44] and they have a little bit of luxury
[25:46] there where they can they can open that
[25:49] spread on you
[25:50] and that's why it's a little bit
[25:52] trickier to operate in that versus
[25:54] something like this market here it
[25:56] doesn't mean i don't love forex still i
[25:58] do but right now forex is just quiet
[26:00] it's not doing
[26:02] things that i would promote in my
[26:05] students attention
[26:07] i'm telling all my students both
[26:09] in my private group and you all hear
[26:11] that this is the markets that you should
[26:13] be following
[26:14] these these markets right here the index
[26:16] features
[26:18] i'm sure there'll be a time when we
[26:19] transition from index features back to
[26:20] forex but until i see them loosen up a
[26:23] little bit in the currencies my
[26:25] attention is here okay so
[26:27] anyway getting short here
[26:29] this is a shallow run below that old low
[26:32] so we anticipate it to run a little bit
[26:34] deeper and it does okay so you could
[26:36] take profits below this low here as a
[26:37] partial
[26:38] and then
[26:41] you've seen now obviously multiple
[26:43] opportunities within the same
[26:45] morning session
[26:47] so it's also showing you how if you miss
[26:49] your entry
[26:51] how can you get back in line with the
[26:53] marketplace
[26:54] and still participate in these moves now
[26:57] there are going to be days where we
[26:58] don't have this many retracements back
[27:00] and back and back and then goes lower
[27:02] it'll be just one or two and it just
[27:04] keeps on going or many times it'll be
[27:06] just right at the opening and that's it
[27:07] you missed it it just goes right to
[27:09] where you thought it was gonna go for
[27:10] the day and you can't get mad about that
[27:12] you should be happy that your analysis
[27:14] concepts are speaking to you with that
[27:16] much clarity
[27:18] and just know that because they repeat
[27:20] none of you should be upset that you
[27:22] missed the trade
[27:23] like none of you nobody has the
[27:25] permission okay you have
[27:28] no right to be angry about missing a
[27:31] trade
[27:32] because they are like buses
[27:34] okay
[27:35] mass transit
[27:37] buses that come by like a schedule you
[27:40] know every certain
[27:41] time of the hour a day these buses are
[27:43] going to come around these trades are
[27:45] just like that you can set your clock to
[27:47] them okay they're they're gonna form
[27:50] they're gonna be there
[27:51] your number one goal is to understand
[27:54] where is it likely to go to
[27:55] where is it likely to reach for if you
[27:57] have that understood
[27:59] it becomes so easy to know what you're
[28:02] looking for notice what i said there
[28:05] it becomes easy to know what you are
[28:07] looking for i did not say it's so easy
[28:10] for you to make money
[28:12] there's a strong contrast there okay
[28:15] but by default over time once you have
[28:18] been doing the things that lead to you
[28:20] understanding what is you're looking for
[28:21] and that part becomes easier what do you
[28:24] think the default result was going to be
[28:26] from that
[28:27] it's probably going to be easier for you
[28:28] to make money over time
[28:30] okay so i'm keeping things in balance
[28:33] that we understand what i'm saying
[28:34] without sugarcoating it and making it
[28:36] sound like anybody can walk in here and
[28:37] do this it's gonna take some effort now
[28:39] you're probably looking at that pink
[28:41] rectangle asking yourself what the heck
[28:43] is that well
[28:44] that is the pm session by side liquidity
[28:48] pool
[28:49] what does that mean
[28:50] this high here was the most energetic
[28:52] one in the morning session it took us
[28:54] all the way down to what
[28:55] target we were looking for the daily
[28:56] bullish order block
[28:58] because it's friday because it hit the
[29:00] daily time frame objective
[29:03] it's in a discount market it's
[29:05] really traded lower
[29:08] end of week
[29:09] there's going to be a retracement back
[29:12] into the weekly range
[29:14] what can it aim for well you can aim for
[29:16] the liquidity resting right here because
[29:18] a lot of people are going to say well
[29:20] you know this is the place where my stop
[29:22] should be at because i want to hold on
[29:23] to this thing over the weekend
[29:25] now i don't know who has the
[29:27] courage to do that anymore with all the
[29:28] things going on around the world i
[29:30] personally don't have the courage to
[29:31] hold over the weekend it's just too many
[29:33] things can go wrong i'm not sitting in a
[29:36] potential opportunity where it's a
[29:38] thousand point gap against me you know
[29:42] we start trading on sunday no thank you
[29:43] i'll pass on that
[29:45] but this area here is where you would
[29:47] anticipate on fridays
[29:50] where liquidity could be a draw because
[29:53] it's going to likely pull back up into
[29:56] a premium what does that mean
[29:58] here's 8 30.
[30:00] here's the turning point at the 9 30
[30:04] rotation
[30:05] so this high or we could use this high
[30:08] here it doesn't make a difference but
[30:09] i'm going to use this one because we're
[30:11] framing the logic because this day being
[30:13] bearish so this high down to the
[30:16] target
[30:18] if you put a fibonacci on this
[30:20] low
[30:21] to high and find the 50 level this is
[30:24] above 50 so that means above here that's
[30:27] a premium
[30:28] so the market's going to move from what
[30:30] a discount
[30:33] to a premium
[30:34] that's what the market does that's the
[30:36] algorithm does it seeks
[30:38] discount to premium premium to discount
[30:41] within that logic
[30:43] the market is reaching for liquidity in
[30:45] the form of buy stops and sell stops and
[30:48] or
[30:50] imbalances or the creation of an
[30:52] imbalance fair value gaps or returning
[30:55] back to a fair value gap okay
[30:57] that's all these algorithms do
[31:00] and they do it on the basis of time
[31:03] then price
[31:05] now that's a gross oversimplification by
[31:08] me but
[31:10] by far and large that's all these things
[31:13] do
[31:14] it's not your buying and selling
[31:15] pressure okay it's not the effects of
[31:18] the dom okay
[31:20] uh i got a lot of people asking me
[31:22] because they watched me
[31:23] show things in my live account and they
[31:25] think i traded with the dom
[31:27] i don't trade with the don okay i'm not
[31:29] looking at the dom trying to read how
[31:32] many orders are resting above or below
[31:34] because there's
[31:35] spoofing that goes on
[31:37] and those orders may not be there when
[31:39] the price goes there so i i don't think
[31:42] that the dom is something that is useful
[31:44] i'm only throwing that in here because i
[31:46] saw a lot of people in the comments
[31:47] asking about those types of things
[31:49] and i don't use them i don't use them in
[31:51] my trading and i don't think there's
[31:53] anything in terms of
[31:55] advantage in using it
[31:57] if you believe you're being profitable
[31:59] because you are don't let my comment
[32:01] change your mind and i'm not trying to
[32:03] open up a dialogue for debate because
[32:05] you're never going to convince me okay
[32:07] so
[32:08] you're okay if you're using it but i'm
[32:10] answering
[32:11] students or viewers and that's my
[32:13] opinion okay so i'm not trying to
[32:16] begin a debate about it okay
[32:19] so we have a pm session by celebrity
[32:21] pool that the market could likely reach
[32:22] up into and again the logic is
[32:24] we move from this high down to a target
[32:27] it's friday there's probably going to be
[32:29] position squaring
[32:31] they're going to want to take the market
[32:32] back higher so
[32:35] what are they going to reach for as an
[32:36] opposing move
[32:37] notice what i'm saying here
[32:40] this was the target
[32:41] there's gonna be short covering who's
[32:43] short coloring the smart money that's
[32:45] sold short here here here here here and
[32:48] here
[32:49] so if they're covering a short are they
[32:50] bearish still no
[32:52] so if they're not bearish what are they
[32:54] bullish so if they're going to be smart
[32:56] money and buy down here
[32:59] or if they're going to use this
[33:01] imbalance in here if it trades down into
[33:02] that you can see it run higher
[33:05] if they're going to buy it what are they
[33:06] going to target
[33:09] the buy stops up here
[33:10] and they're going to sell right to those
[33:11] buy stops
[33:12] they're buying this
[33:14] and selling it to these waiting buyers
[33:17] and their buy stops
[33:19] notice these relative equal lows they
[33:21] take it into the order block right below
[33:23] those relative equal lows
[33:25] because it sells what
[33:26] it sells the retail crowd that this was
[33:29] support broken
[33:32] what are they going to want to do
[33:34] when it trades back up into these
[33:35] relative equal lows they're going to do
[33:36] what sell right that creates more
[33:39] liquidity for buying
[33:42] so this is engineering
[33:44] buy side liquidity
[33:46] on the basis of sell side
[33:49] flow
[33:51] sellers coming in the marketplace
[33:54] these sellers they're going to have a
[33:55] counterparty in the form of smart money
[33:57] buying it
[33:58] they want to sell short because they see
[34:00] relative equal lows breaking the trends
[34:02] been down
[34:04] everything looks bearish to them because
[34:05] it's been going down all day long so
[34:07] they think naturally it's going to keep
[34:08] going down
[34:09] when it's only traded down to where the
[34:11] algorithm says
[34:13] this is what we wanted and now we're
[34:14] going to reprice higher we're going to
[34:16] move from a discount
[34:18] to a premium
[34:19] the premium intraday is going to be this
[34:22] area here and that's going to be where
[34:23] the market draws to
[34:25] for the afternoon session buy side
[34:28] liquidity
[34:31] all right i was going to do the pause
[34:33] the video type thing here but this is
[34:34] going to be a long video so i'm just
[34:37] going to go right into it
[34:38] all right so we have a
[34:40] mitigation block
[34:42] here and i teach that in the youtube
[34:44] channel
[34:45] but we have market structure breaking we
[34:47] come back down into the mitigation block
[34:48] and we also have the imbalance here they
[34:51] got there so we can be a buyer here
[34:53] and remember
[34:55] the
[34:57] 45 32 the 45 40 level
[35:01] go back up to this chart here
[35:05] right in here so this high
[35:08] right here to here think about those
[35:09] price ranges
[35:13] we trade up into it here
[35:15] so buying here and aiming for that
[35:17] liquidity
[35:18] up here
[35:20] that would be your target from buying
[35:22] to getting out there selling to those
[35:24] waiting buy stops
[35:28] the next one is here
[35:29] the market trades down in
[35:32] and i count you to go into your chart i
[35:34] left this out for your own personal
[35:35] study but if you look to the left go
[35:38] over here you'll see an old high
[35:40] okay old highs are a
[35:42] discount array if we trade above an old
[35:44] high that old high becomes a discount
[35:46] array
[35:48] this is where
[35:50] not all the time but this is where
[35:52] old highs being broken become support
[35:55] that's why sometimes the books have it
[35:58] right that's why sometimes your analysis
[36:01] will be right about specific key highs
[36:03] and lows but notice they're not always
[36:05] consistent and that's the problem so you
[36:07] want to know what makes a old high or an
[36:10] old low real supportive resistance when
[36:12] you have the logic when i'm framing here
[36:14] because we know the likelihood of the
[36:15] market's going to draw up into this area
[36:17] here because that's where the buy stops
[36:18] are resting
[36:20] above the marketplace when it hit the
[36:21] order block down here
[36:23] so what we're saying is the market's
[36:26] going to bounce from here up into this
[36:27] vicinity here
[36:30] so if the market comes back down in and
[36:32] touches
[36:33] it could have touched this high here but
[36:35] there's an old height to the left over
[36:36] here you'll see it it trades down and
[36:38] hits that and it also fills in an
[36:40] imbalance when you have that old highs
[36:42] broken will act as support
[36:45] so there's something for your notes
[36:47] then we have the run up into that area
[36:50] so it's not a bad little run
[36:53] now once we get up into that shaded pink
[36:55] area
[36:56] what have we done we fulfilled by side
[36:58] liquidity
[36:59] in this area here but we have a little
[37:00] bit more later on which obviously you
[37:02] can see it runs too but but here we see
[37:04] it do a run lower so we break below
[37:07] swing low market structure shifts is
[37:10] there any imbalances in here
[37:13] no but there is one right there
[37:15] see that
[37:17] here's your favorite value gap shift in
[37:18] market structure there
[37:20] retraces back up into the fair value gap
[37:23] you can be a seller there
[37:26] and aim for this low
[37:28] or the order block
[37:30] or you can wait for a confirmation entry
[37:33] which is
[37:34] we turn here after it hits that fair
[37:36] value gap
[37:37] breaks lower and then we have another
[37:39] break in the structure of the
[37:40] marketplace on the one-minute chart
[37:45] creates the imbalance here if everybody
[37:46] got trades up yes it overshoots it but
[37:48] we also have two fair value guys
[37:50] remember the rules i gave you if you
[37:52] have a fair value gap and a small one
[37:53] right above it anticipate it likely
[37:54] trading up into you but
[37:56] use this as your entry
[37:58] go short here
[38:00] and aim for the order block
[38:05] so
[38:06] if you have
[38:09] an understanding of how we're going to
[38:11] work within the
[38:12] intraday volatility using liquidity
[38:15] using the time of day
[38:17] using the day of week all these things
[38:19] come together and they make a really
[38:21] beautiful tapestry so you can read price
[38:23] action now
[38:24] i know there's a large number of you
[38:26] that are going to watch this and it's
[38:28] going to feel
[38:29] and seem like obviously anybody can go
[38:32] back in time and do these types of
[38:33] things
[38:35] but a lot of my trades when you see my
[38:37] examples and you see the things i record
[38:39] and show you they're using logic like
[38:41] this
[38:42] so it's not contrived it's not
[38:44] form-fitted it's not cherry-picked for
[38:46] the purpose of just being something to
[38:48] talk about this is what you're looking
[38:50] for and when you do your back testing i
[38:52] got a lot of questions in the comment
[38:53] section about this as well
[38:55] you go through your charts just like i'm
[38:57] doing here and you annotate them now in
[38:59] all these areas where there's empty
[39:01] space here or over here or over here
[39:04] you're putting in little notations and
[39:05] you're typing them out and yes it takes
[39:07] time yes it's tedious yes it takes a
[39:10] great deal of effort and
[39:12] desire but this stuff
[39:16] rewards that
[39:18] like it rewards it
[39:19] it's not like fantasy football where you
[39:22] know who cares if your team wins
[39:24] this
[39:26] pays you
[39:27] this is something that you can feed your
[39:28] family with okay if you
[39:30] need your
[39:32] expenses to be reduced and you don't
[39:34] want to get on a job or you're
[39:36] you know you take a pay cut maybe you
[39:37] had a you know job loss or whatever
[39:40] this skill set can fortify
[39:43] any
[39:44] weak links in your financial chain okay
[39:47] you want to build strength
[39:49] in your ability to make income and build
[39:52] legacy wealth
[39:54] it's worthwhile for you to spend time
[39:57] learning this and that means going back
[39:58] through old charts and old moves and
[40:01] literally going in and annotating the
[40:03] moves like this and mapping them out and
[40:05] seeing the logic that's there now
[40:09] do not be afraid
[40:11] that you're going to do it wrong
[40:14] all of you are going to be doing it
[40:15] wrong in the beginning
[40:17] this is a skill set in back testing
[40:19] you're trying to discover
[40:21] okay you're not trying to do things
[40:23] correctly in back testing
[40:26] back testing is you in a mode of
[40:28] discovery that proves efficacy if you
[40:31] can't see things repeating then you got
[40:34] to go back into the core content lessons
[40:36] of this youtube channel and figured out
[40:38] what it is i'm teaching conceptually
[40:40] then once you understand better what it
[40:42] is i'm showing you then you go back into
[40:44] the old data and look for those very
[40:46] things occurring then highlight the
[40:48] things in your chart that makes the most
[40:50] sense to you over time doing it and
[40:52] frankly you should be doing this
[40:55] at least a minimum of a year
[40:57] okay make it a practice of doing all
[40:59] that even when you start trading with
[41:00] live funds
[41:02] your trade journal should always have
[41:04] annotations you should always have
[41:07] charts saved and just
[41:09] constantly referring to what you
[41:11] witnessed in price
[41:12] and
[41:13] record it like you saw it happening and
[41:16] knew it was going to happen in advance
[41:18] that's called self-talk
[41:20] okay you're literally tricking your
[41:22] brain
[41:23] into seeing your annotations as
[41:25] something that you foreseen coming
[41:28] and that way when you go back and you
[41:29] read your journal and you study it on
[41:31] the weekends or
[41:32] you know whenever you go through a
[41:33] period of drawdown and you need
[41:35] encouragement you go back to your charts
[41:38] in your journal and you'll see
[41:39] annotations that you wrote out yourself
[41:41] and
[41:42] it tricks your brain believing that
[41:44] you've seen that all along now what
[41:46] happens
[41:47] by doing that over time
[41:49] is you have created
[41:51] creases in your brain
[41:54] where that knowledge and that pseudo
[41:56] experience has been retained
[41:58] but your brain remembers it as what
[42:01] a real experience that you endured
[42:04] but you're recording it with positive
[42:05] reinforcement in your commentary never
[42:08] put negative comments in your annotation
[42:10] don't say like oh i was stupid i missed
[42:11] this oh i'm so dumb i fell victim to the
[42:14] shark pattern you don't do all that kind
[42:16] of stuff you don't have to worry about
[42:17] swimming with sharks you don't have to
[42:19] worry about animal patterns you don't
[42:20] need to be worried about any of those
[42:22] types of things all you're looking for
[42:23] is liquidity imbalances time of day
[42:26] that's it
[42:27] that's it that's all this game is all
[42:29] about okay the algorithm is not going to
[42:32] try to follow some retail logic stuff
[42:35] it's based on where is the money
[42:38] where's the money who's the most
[42:40] easy prey right now and where is the
[42:43] majority of the money and that's where
[42:45] it's going to run for that's all it's
[42:46] going to do
[42:47] and if you
[42:50] strip everything you think you know
[42:51] about the markets away
[42:53] and just
[42:54] give me a a couple months
[42:58] stay with me for a couple months here
[43:00] and i promise you you will put
[43:03] everything else down
[43:05] and see it like this
[43:07] because this is the truth this is the
[43:10] perfect understanding of what makes
[43:12] these markets book
[43:14] that means
[43:15] what makes them go up and down where
[43:17] they turn why they go where they go why
[43:19] are they moving when they move and why
[43:21] are they arriving when they arriving at
[43:23] that price point
[43:25] it's all algorithmic and it has
[43:27] absolutely nothing to do
[43:29] with
[43:30] ratios
[43:32] it has nothing to do with anything
[43:33] harmonic
[43:35] nothing supply and demand zone nothing
[43:37] to do with elliott wave nothing to do
[43:39] with white golf
[43:40] nothing to do with gan
[43:41] none of that stuff has anything to do
[43:43] with it
[43:45] i literally have just
[43:47] explained exactly what these markets do
[43:50] that's it
[43:51] there's nothing else that happens the
[43:53] buying and selling pressure
[43:54] it's a myth because these markets are
[43:56] going to go higher regardless of how
[43:58] many contracts come in if they want this
[44:00] thing to go up here it doesn't require
[44:04] millions of contracts to put it there
[44:07] it doesn't
[44:08] how many contracts does it take for this
[44:10] candle to move from that opening price
[44:13] to that closing price
[44:16] tell me how many cam how many contracts
[44:18] does it take for that to happen
[44:20] it only needs two two transactions two
[44:23] transactions one here and when it gaps
[44:25] up here and reprices to that price point
[44:27] and it offers it to the market that
[44:28] price and someone comes in with a market
[44:30] order what happens boom
[44:32] it's it the candle has been created
[44:35] two trades how many contracts it doesn't
[44:36] make a difference you only need a
[44:38] transaction
[44:41] what
[44:42] yeah
[44:44] folks listen
[44:46] you can sit down and listen to these
[44:48] videos i'm producing
[44:50] and coming with the preconceived notion
[44:51] that everything i'm saying is nonsense
[44:54] it's not true and it's not valid because
[44:56] you don't want it to be
[44:59] all i'm asking you to do
[45:01] is put everything you think you
[45:03] understand
[45:04] put it aside for a moment
[45:06] just for a little while
[45:08] and go in and do the things i'm telling
[45:10] you to do
[45:11] i
[45:12] guarantee you
[45:14] you will absolutely fall in love with
[45:18] this
[45:19] because this is consistency
[45:22] this is
[45:23] consistency that you have always
[45:26] hoped for but everything else just falls
[45:29] short in delivering
[45:30] it and you're getting it for free
[45:34] and i'm loving it while giving it to you
[45:37] because i know
[45:39] and you're all going to see it
[45:40] when all these little light bulbs come
[45:42] on and all the people watching these
[45:44] videos and folks this channel is growing
[45:47] it's growing and this train's going to
[45:49] keep on rolling
[45:51] yeah
[45:52] this community is getting bigger and
[45:54] bigger
[45:55] because it's infectious
[45:58] results matter proof matters
[46:02] and when students go into this
[46:04] and they see the results
[46:06] man
[46:07] it's sweet isn't it isn't it sweet when
[46:09] you see
[46:11] the truth finally just laid out in front
[46:12] of you
[46:14] there's no trickery here
[46:16] there's no twisting of your arm give me
[46:18] your credit card payment
[46:20] you don't you don't have to
[46:22] blow
[46:23] any kisses to me okay i don't need
[46:26] flowers i just want you to make a real
[46:30] effort
[46:31] and then tell me
[46:32] what your results are what did you get
[46:35] from it
[46:36] i promise you i'm promising you you will
[46:39] find what you're looking for but you got
[46:41] to put the work into it because if you
[46:43] don't put the work into it
[46:44] it won't matter
[46:46] because you'll just think it's
[46:48] too much work
[46:49] and i'm telling you it only feels like a
[46:52] lot of work in the beginning but once
[46:54] you understand what you're looking for
[46:56] like this setup here
[46:58] that might be your particular setup and
[47:00] this up here isn't your setup
[47:02] this might be your setup here because
[47:04] it's based on that old highlights you'll
[47:05] find if you scroll back on your own
[47:07] chart that might be your setup and not
[47:09] this one down here
[47:11] that's what i'm referring to when i say
[47:13] when you find
[47:15] your unique model that means a setup
[47:17] that is so similar every time you take
[47:19] it it repeats the same general idea
[47:23] just in a different chart on a different
[47:26] day in a different time frame
[47:28] that's it that's all it is that's a
[47:30] that's your unique model
[47:32] you're learning how to do it with what
[47:33] i'm teaching you but
[47:35] where you're looking for it in what
[47:37] market and what
[47:39] narrative that you're looking for what
[47:41] makes that setup your particular setup
[47:45] that's a unique thing for you and that's
[47:47] the weird
[47:49] beautiful element to trading and the way
[47:52] these markets operate is it allows each
[47:54] and every one of us to have our own
[47:56] unique model
[47:58] we can all use the things i'm teaching
[48:01] and all fine setups within the same
[48:03] trading day and be opposed to every
[48:06] individual trade setup
[48:08] individually in other words we could all
[48:09] be doing something and not agree with
[48:12] any of it
[48:13] you took a short there i was long a
[48:15] little while before that or i went short
[48:17] and you went along somewhere else and
[48:19] you're ending a trade where i'm getting
[48:21] ready to put on a trade
[48:24] it's amazing
[48:26] but how you internalize the market what
[48:28] setup you're looking for
[48:30] there's lots of them and if you break
[48:32] this chart down into a 30 second chart
[48:34] or a 15 second chart there's even more
[48:36] setups
[48:38] everything's fractal
[48:40] so if you want to do high frequency
[48:41] trading
[48:42] you can do that with the second chart
[48:45] you may not be able to pull up second
[48:46] charts because you may not have the
[48:51] i guess the subscription level on
[48:53] trading view and i don't get any
[48:54] subscription kickbacks i'm not trying to
[48:56] get you to buy anything from tradingview
[48:58] i'm just stating that
[49:01] you can make this
[49:02] however you want
[49:04] and if you just want to stay on a
[49:05] 15-minute chart and trade a daily range
[49:07] okay there's no reason to do anything
[49:09] less than that but if you want to get
[49:11] busy
[49:13] and
[49:14] pyramid your positions that means like
[49:15] say you bought one down here
[49:17] or say you bought
[49:19] say about five down here
[49:21] and you bought three here and you bought
[49:23] two here and then you roll it up into
[49:25] your objective that's pyramiding your
[49:27] biggest position
[49:28] put on first then a smaller position on
[49:31] and then a smaller position and then
[49:33] that that's how you build up the equity
[49:35] and you get velocity in your equity
[49:36] growth that way
[49:38] versus buying one then buying two then
[49:40] buying forward and buying eight that
[49:42] that is reckless and i've done that and
[49:44] i've roasted accounts doing it so
[49:46] don't do that but
[49:49] hopefully this is at least got your
[49:51] gears turning about how you can go in
[49:52] and back test a little bit um how you
[49:55] can see multiple trade setups and how we
[49:57] can work with higher time frame pd
[49:59] arrays and
[50:00] the
[50:01] pd array matrix where it's discounted
[50:03] premium and premium to discount and how
[50:06] we use and incorporate all the different
[50:07] arrays where i'm sure
[50:10] someone new watching this your head's
[50:11] spinning right now you're like i have a
[50:12] thousand questions right now and i i
[50:14] need to know this no you don't need to
[50:16] know what you're asking for right now
[50:18] you only feel like you need to know
[50:20] right now
[50:21] take the things i'm showing you at the
[50:23] pace i'm showing you study them and i
[50:26] promise a couple months from now you're
[50:28] going to know a whole lot more than you
[50:29] know right now
[50:31] and you'll be able to go in and see
[50:32] things in price action that you don't
[50:34] even identify right now even in
[50:36] hindsight
[50:38] you just got to give yourself the time
[50:40] and give yourself the real effort
[50:42] to learn this
[50:44] i've stripped it down i made it as
[50:46] streamlined as i possibly could and i
[50:48] promise
[50:49] you will get this
[50:52] and until i'll talk to you next time
[50:54] be safe
