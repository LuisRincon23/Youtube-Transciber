[00:00] all right folks welcome back
[00:02] our continuing series on the
[00:04] 2022 free ict mentorship
[00:07] on youtube we're looking at the e-mini s
[00:09] p june contract for 2022 daily chart all
[00:13] right so i'm going to teach you a little
[00:13] bit about intraday profiles and daily
[00:16] range
[00:17] and we're going to be using
[00:20] this
[00:21] idea here
[00:23] so
[00:24] initially on twitter
[00:26] if you were following me on
[00:29] that platform
[00:30] and i mentioned how i was going to start
[00:32] the day looking for a potential run to
[00:35] 40-70
[00:37] okay so 40-70 was my
[00:39] initial draw on liquidity to see if
[00:40] people want to reach down into that
[00:42] level if you look in this area here
[00:43] that's my fair value gap
[00:46] and you can see we traded down into it
[00:47] here
[00:48] then today one more time you shoot it
[00:50] into it left these relative equal lows
[00:53] in place
[00:54] and then started to move higher
[00:56] i took everybody's attention to
[00:58] previous days high
[01:00] and
[01:02] this high here
[01:04] and if this continues to go higher
[01:06] i mentioned this before
[01:09] i can't recall what video
[01:11] but i know i mentioned it in here this
[01:12] is where we could potentially draw up to
[01:14] for our enemy term
[01:16] target our objective
[01:18] but i'm not cosigning that just yet
[01:20] right here
[01:22] and here is enough okay
[01:24] so we're expecting higher prices after
[01:27] this shift in intraday volatility
[01:31] so we'll look at that now going into
[01:32] lower time frames
[01:34] all right here's the hourly chart
[01:36] you can see how we
[01:37] [Music]
[01:38] did not take these relative equal those
[01:40] out i want to see it go down there
[01:41] that's what i was looking forward to try
[01:43] to draw it into that
[01:44] it didn't do it
[01:46] it did not give a setup either based on
[01:48] the model i'm teaching you
[01:50] so
[01:52] i used the intraday volatility and the
[01:55] framework to kind of like
[01:58] teach it today a little bit more about
[02:00] bias how to change gears with your bias
[02:04] how to also manage your bias okay so
[02:07] initially in the beginning of the
[02:08] morning i was looking for a potential
[02:09] run to 40 70. it gave an opportunity
[02:13] to
[02:16] tape read
[02:17] quote unquote paper trade or even demo
[02:21] using
[02:22] the draw on liquidity but
[02:24] the model itself
[02:26] didn't materialize okay so
[02:31] because i'm the author of these concepts
[02:32] i have a lot of tools at my disposal and
[02:36] i have a little bit better understanding
[02:37] of
[02:38] price delivery than
[02:40] the average student of mine so if i go
[02:42] in and i show you something in this
[02:44] lecture today the main takeaways before
[02:46] i get into is this
[02:48] what did i do and how do i go about
[02:51] abandoning a specific bias
[02:55] how do i change gears if it is
[02:57] applicable sometimes it's not applicable
[03:00] to reverse it just means moves or
[03:02] sidelines and just say i'm not going to
[03:04] do anything
[03:06] and what are the characteristics that
[03:08] would lead to
[03:09] a bias that is changed
[03:12] and how do you use
[03:14] that logic going forward
[03:16] and how to navigate the new york lunch
[03:18] hour okay so we're going to tackle those
[03:20] topics in this video all right so notice
[03:23] that we had this low here
[03:26] taken with this run
[03:28] then this low was taken with this run
[03:32] and this low was taken with that run so
[03:34] notice what we are seeing we're seeing
[03:36] multiple lows
[03:38] get taken
[03:41] and then
[03:43] the market reverses
[03:46] while offering really no
[03:48] high probability shorting opportunity
[03:51] the 4070 level never got tagged
[03:54] liquidity left in place
[03:56] okay
[03:59] previous day's high
[04:01] which is here
[04:05] that high
[04:06] was not traded to
[04:08] so we have
[04:09] a high of 41 68 and a quarter
[04:14] then we have a fair value gap over here
[04:16] so you have two premium arrays
[04:19] that may be
[04:21] a draw on liquidity that takes it up in
[04:22] the air and maybe even run above
[04:24] these relative equal highs all right on
[04:26] the 15 minute time frame you can see how
[04:28] we just kept going lower than the
[04:29] previous lows
[04:32] and then
[04:32] finally we had a run higher so we had a
[04:34] short term shift in market structure
[04:36] relative to the 15 minute time frame
[04:39] remember that's our bellwether chart
[04:41] so it runs higher
[04:43] creates a fair value gap in here and
[04:45] trades down into it here okay
[04:48] one of the things i want to kind of
[04:49] bring to your attention because a lot of
[04:51] you are familiar with a gentleman by the
[04:54] name of chris laurie and he talks about
[04:56] liquidity voids where
[04:58] he teaches how the market wants to come
[04:59] back down and
[05:01] fill all that area in
[05:03] as you probably noticed i don't teach
[05:06] that i teach obviously there's times
[05:08] when that can occur but
[05:11] because i understand the algorithm that
[05:13] is not likely to occur most times okay
[05:17] so
[05:18] it's important to know where the
[05:18] market's reaching for
[05:21] and then look for these imbalances in
[05:23] price
[05:24] and then what makes it a fair value gap
[05:26] is the fact that it's coming down into
[05:28] this area here
[05:31] or inside this area here
[05:34] or this area here or this area here
[05:37] so they're all fair value gaps
[05:40] it's a fair value to buy it
[05:43] if you're bullish
[05:44] okay
[05:46] i'm not trying to
[05:49] insist that these imbalances completely
[05:52] rebalance that's one of the main
[05:54] differentiations between me
[05:56] and chris laurie
[05:58] now i'm not knocking chris lord because
[06:00] i believe if you want to learn price
[06:02] action it's basic and goes beyond the
[06:05] average retail stuff
[06:07] then you can learn from him uh he's the
[06:09] only one i really give a nod to in
[06:11] technical analysis and as far as
[06:13] education and i send people there all
[06:15] the time i don't have a relationship
[06:16] with him on a business level and he
[06:18] doesn't give me any kickbacks i don't
[06:20] ask for anything i just think he's a
[06:22] generally nice guy okay so there you go
[06:25] but there is a stark contrast between
[06:27] what he does and what i do and how i
[06:29] teach
[06:30] so
[06:31] there's a there's a degree of
[06:36] precision
[06:38] that is
[06:39] given to you when you understand the
[06:41] things i'm teaching you it goes beyond
[06:43] simply imbalance rebounds
[06:45] while that is important there are times
[06:47] when that is
[06:48] a factor
[06:50] but what i'm teaching you is where is
[06:52] the market likely to go to okay
[06:54] i'm not trying to teach you entry
[06:56] patterns with a
[06:58] importance that getting in in a specific
[07:01] price level is the most important factor
[07:02] i'm teaching you how to determine where
[07:04] the market's likely to go to next
[07:06] where's that draw on liquidity
[07:09] now there's a lot of different ways
[07:11] that that is calculated
[07:13] on an institutional level okay and how
[07:16] it's determined
[07:17] it's not buying selling pressure okay
[07:20] but it is
[07:21] algorithmic
[07:23] so the easiest way for me to cut through
[07:25] all of the very complicated things that
[07:28] could very easily bog you down and you
[07:30] may feel like the things i'm teaching
[07:32] are complicated and i guess
[07:34] when you remove the idea of putting an
[07:36] indicator that says your overbought
[07:37] oversold or crossing over two lines that
[07:40] gives you a buy or sell
[07:42] you know
[07:44] it's not in my opinion
[07:46] wisdom to
[07:48] exchange
[07:49] a decision especially if you ever decide
[07:51] to do this with real money
[07:54] it's not wise for you to determine
[07:56] your
[07:57] bet
[07:58] or your gamble or your investment on
[08:01] what an indicator is saying versus
[08:04] reading price action and getting the
[08:05] logic behind what it's doing okay and
[08:07] that's narrative what is narrative
[08:09] narrative is the understanding of what
[08:11] price should do
[08:12] why
[08:14] and what things will it encounter to
[08:16] prove that the narrative that you are
[08:17] assuming is in place
[08:19] is in fact underway
[08:21] now that's a
[08:22] mouthful i'm sure most of you probably
[08:24] didn't get much out of that but i'm
[08:26] going to break it down for you i was
[08:27] looking for 40 70 today to see if it can
[08:29] get down outside the range of that daily
[08:31] fair value gap
[08:33] and
[08:34] we failed to do so and then the market
[08:37] shifted higher
[08:38] now the whole time i'm looking at the
[08:41] market it's not giving me any kind of
[08:43] short
[08:44] i'm not comfortable taking any kind of
[08:46] short and all of a sudden the market
[08:48] does this
[08:49] okay
[08:50] no panic
[08:51] no i'm missing a move no
[08:55] you know calling somebody else or
[08:56] reaching out to somebody on a social
[08:58] media platform and ask them what do you
[08:59] think's happening
[09:02] i don't worry about anybody else's
[09:03] opinion you shouldn't worry about
[09:04] anybody else's opinion either
[09:06] you're going to learn how to trust
[09:07] yourself
[09:09] so we had created a fair value gap here
[09:11] on the 15 minute time frame so right
[09:13] away that is your
[09:14] area to watch and see if price supports
[09:17] a run if it digs into that and starts to
[09:18] repel higher
[09:20] and we take out this short short-term
[09:21] high that is enough to set up a stage
[09:23] for the afternoon trend
[09:26] okay that afternoon session move or set
[09:28] up or price swing
[09:30] that's what we're looking for now
[09:32] because the market failed to go to an
[09:33] objective we were looking for
[09:35] it was respecting that daily fair value
[09:37] gap and it rallied up and what very
[09:39] valuable is that it began the video i
[09:40] showed you on the daily chart
[09:42] here
[09:43] it took out that short term high so now
[09:45] we have an absolute market structure
[09:47] shift
[09:48] bullish with this swing high and the
[09:51] market comes back down in here and
[09:52] rebalances
[09:55] this very very yeah
[09:57] now
[09:58] i'm not looking at and this is where one
[10:00] of the instances where
[10:02] resistance broken turns support but it
[10:05] digs a little bit past that
[10:07] okay
[10:08] notice that it goes down into my fair
[10:09] value gap not stopping dead in its
[10:11] tracks right up to high
[10:13] notice that
[10:14] so
[10:15] i'm not looking at support and
[10:16] resistance i'm looking at the fact that
[10:18] we went through this short term high
[10:20] created an imbalance and then we treated
[10:22] that into that now when we get in this
[10:23] area here
[10:25] i'm interested in looking at intermarket
[10:27] relationships i want to study real
[10:29] accumulation and distribution
[10:31] okay how do i do that i've already tell
[10:33] you we're going to go into the lower
[10:34] time frame five minute chart all right
[10:36] so here's the five minute chart
[10:38] as you can see the market did you know
[10:40] drop down i did real quick sudden move
[10:42] after i tweeted saying that my initial
[10:45] interest was 40 70 and it started
[10:47] drawing lower
[10:48] and then went one more time here
[10:52] at 10 after nine took out that short
[10:54] term low there and then started rallying
[10:56] higher at 9 30 opening
[10:58] and then we dig down into
[11:00] that 15-minute time frame
[11:02] there you go
[11:04] so
[11:05] it doesn't look like a fair bag gap in
[11:06] here notice that
[11:07] but i want you to go back to your
[11:09] 15-minute chart
[11:10] this is where the work is required on
[11:12] your part
[11:13] in this price run from here to here
[11:16] on that 15-minute chart
[11:18] look at your chart and
[11:20] shade that in on a 15-minute time frame
[11:22] and then drop down into the five-minute
[11:23] you'll see how it drops into that shaded
[11:25] area so we're working from a higher time
[11:27] frame 15-minute bellwether chart
[11:31] into a five-minute chart this is running
[11:33] into that fair value gap now if you're
[11:35] just staying on one time frame or at
[11:37] least not carrying over higher time
[11:39] frame
[11:40] analysis into your lower time frame
[11:44] you're gonna be trading blind you have
[11:45] no idea what you're looking for now i
[11:46] know what i'm looking for because i have
[11:47] multiple charts in front of me multiple
[11:49] monitors and i'm i'm panning around when
[11:52] i do my recordings like i did this
[11:53] morning
[11:54] you can see that i actually executed the
[11:56] trade you can see where i got in you can
[11:58] see the actual executions you can see
[12:00] the little arrows that show where i got
[12:02] in i show the price and you can see the
[12:05] partials along the way and the whole
[12:06] business okay
[12:07] so if you're not following me on twitter
[12:09] you don't need to follow me i'm not
[12:10] asking you to follow me
[12:12] but you can go to twitter and you can
[12:14] see that that is
[12:16] uh in fact shown to you there
[12:18] short little vignettes i call them
[12:19] stingers okay i do small little
[12:22] uh segments of me actually treating or
[12:24] i'll do analysis or commentary without
[12:26] really seeing anything and i'll play
[12:28] music behind it because i'm having fun
[12:29] i'm enjoying myself hopefully you guys
[12:31] are here on twitter having fun with me
[12:32] if you're digging it and you're enjoying
[12:34] yourself on my twitter feed give me a
[12:36] heads up in the in the comments below
[12:38] all right so anyway it digs down into
[12:40] that 15 minute time frame for everybody
[12:42] gap here and then
[12:43] rallies higher
[12:44] then it starts to trail off
[12:48] and goes down into
[12:49] this imbalance right here now in that
[12:51] little stinger video i draw this little
[12:52] area out with a rectangle
[12:54] and i do a small little box up here okay
[12:56] and what that box is is if it goes down
[12:58] into here
[12:59] and starts to rally i'm going to take
[13:01] half that position off once it gets into
[13:02] this area here again
[13:04] okay i don't need to go above this short
[13:06] term high so that's what that little
[13:08] red rectangle represents when you see me
[13:09] doing that stinger
[13:11] little vignette video in my twitter feed
[13:13] i'm drawing your attention here so when
[13:15] we go from this level here if it starts
[13:16] to rally up
[13:18] once it gets back up in that area again
[13:20] i'm going to take half the position off
[13:22] and then
[13:23] see if it can run about that high
[13:25] okay so that's what i was drawing today
[13:27] i'm drawing reference that's that way
[13:28] when i talk to you tonight because this
[13:29] is our tuesday lecture
[13:31] i'm showing you now what it is i was
[13:34] referring to and why it was there
[13:35] also if you
[13:37] scrub back over here
[13:39] you'll see it's an old area of bicep
[13:41] liquidity
[13:43] here
[13:44] and it's a fair value gap over there too
[13:47] okay so that little rectangle here is
[13:50] drawing special attention to
[13:52] me reminding myself that over here
[13:54] there's bicep liquidity that is not
[13:55] showing in that video that i'm recording
[13:58] in an imbalance over here so
[14:00] when it runs back up into that
[14:03] this old area of bicep liquidity this
[14:05] might be just a stop run and they're
[14:07] going one more time passing into that
[14:08] level so i want to make sure i get half
[14:10] my position off because i could be wrong
[14:12] like i was wrong about 40 70 didn't
[14:13] trade to it
[14:15] well here
[14:17] at 10 35
[14:20] right there
[14:21] 10 35 right there i tweeted i said note
[14:24] your previous day's high
[14:26] okay previous day is high
[14:31] is here
[14:34] so if we
[14:35] add the annotations
[14:37] back to the chart
[14:39] and we'll remember that 4168 and what
[14:42] price is that
[14:44] 41 68 and a quarter so that's our high
[14:48] that we're likely to draw to that's what
[14:50] i was kind of drawing everyone's
[14:51] attention to
[14:53] and i'll not add the annotations back
[14:55] all right so here is what i had in the
[14:57] recording i shaded this area in here it
[14:59] was a like a shaded box i just drew
[15:01] these
[15:02] really prominent
[15:04] lines here so we can recall that to the
[15:07] pair of head gap that i showed in that
[15:08] little vignette video
[15:10] and i want to talk a little bit about
[15:12] new york lunch
[15:13] okay i gave you rules of engagement when
[15:16] you're trading the afternoon session
[15:18] and primarily what i gave you for the
[15:20] model was a morning session idea but
[15:23] because of other people asking me and
[15:25] inquiring hey can you teach us a little
[15:26] bit about the pm session or the
[15:28] afternoon setup
[15:30] i started bringing in some things
[15:32] now if the market starts to go higher
[15:34] okay in other words if we've been in a
[15:36] bullish market structure
[15:37] and order flow is bullish that means
[15:39] everything's going in one direction
[15:41] the market's obviously going higher on
[15:43] all time frames
[15:46] then that's in the easy trading scenario
[15:48] but we're inside that little trading
[15:50] range area on the daily chart last few
[15:52] days
[15:53] you know or a week or so it's just been
[15:54] hanging around that smaller range so you
[15:56] have to know what you're doing
[15:58] or you're going to get caught up
[16:00] so initially i wanted that 40-70 level
[16:03] we failed to go outside the shaded area
[16:05] here that's that daily fair valuable so
[16:08] i've added it here for your edification
[16:10] notice that these lows here here this is
[16:12] lower than that one why is that
[16:14] important why am i drawing a distinction
[16:16] between those two well if you go and you
[16:18] add your nasdaq chart overlay you'll see
[16:22] that this is a divergence
[16:25] so even the s p was relatively stronger
[16:27] than that of the
[16:28] nasdaq nasdaq made a lower low here
[16:32] okay
[16:33] and i'll show you that before i close
[16:34] the lecture out but for now this is that
[16:37] five minute
[16:40] chart returning back into that 15 minute
[16:42] imbalance
[16:44] so that's there for your edification as
[16:45] well
[16:47] this is the opening price at midnight
[16:49] that's what that level is
[16:51] now i teach if we're bullish we want to
[16:53] be buying at
[16:55] or close to
[16:57] the opening price
[16:58] okay
[16:59] now
[17:00] here's one of those advance
[17:02] ict things
[17:04] okay
[17:05] if you know that the market is likely
[17:08] to go down to go up
[17:11] then you can wait for
[17:12] price to give you this type of setup
[17:14] right here where it goes down
[17:17] shift the market structure come back
[17:19] down into a 15 minute time frame if
[17:21] everybody got
[17:22] this is intraday or day trading it is
[17:26] not the model i gave you where it is a
[17:30] scalp essentially that's what that is
[17:32] the model i've provided for you for this
[17:34] youtube channel is a scalping
[17:37] model
[17:38] that's exactly what it is but if you're
[17:40] going to day trade daily range
[17:42] you're going to be using the 15 and 5
[17:44] minute chart
[17:45] and there it is now you can use that
[17:47] model that i gave you for
[17:48] entries and
[17:50] scalping you can use that as your entry
[17:52] criteria but with the logic and
[17:54] narrative that you're going to trade in
[17:55] the daily range okay
[17:57] so
[17:59] if we're bullish i teach and i have
[18:01] taught on this youtube channel multiple
[18:03] times
[18:04] my power three concept is if we're
[18:06] bullish we're gonna be looking for the
[18:08] opening price at midnight
[18:10] is going to drop down create the low of
[18:12] the day it's forming it
[18:14] at 905 i'm sorry 9 10
[18:17] new york local time
[18:19] it rallies up shift and market structure
[18:21] so it doesn't give me my objective but
[18:23] it gives me these clues here now whole
[18:25] time i'm i'm not tweeting to you i'm
[18:27] studying christ i'm working with my son
[18:30] and i'm
[18:31] measuring all these things
[18:33] because last word i gave on twitter was
[18:35] i was looking for 40 70. no problem no
[18:38] trade either but i mentioned that there
[18:40] was no setup there's nothing going on
[18:42] and then the market rallies up
[18:43] okay what i was looking for it didn't
[18:45] reach it and it didn't give me a setup
[18:47] did i lose any money did i take any kind
[18:50] of a a painful ego twist to my arm no
[18:54] was i wrong in the public eye well some
[18:56] of you may think that because it didn't
[18:58] go to 40 70 but
[18:59] if i'm looking for something to deliver
[19:01] and it doesn't give me a setup last time
[19:03] i checked if you don't put a trade on
[19:06] did you lose no
[19:08] if you put some skin in the race and you
[19:09] tell the public what you think is going
[19:10] to happen it doesn't happen do you lose
[19:13] well it depends on what your audience's
[19:15] mentality is if they're looking for face
[19:17] value yeah i was wrong about 40 70. you
[19:20] hear that
[19:22] ict didn't get something he thought
[19:26] 40 70 didn't print
[19:28] no problem
[19:29] i don't need to be right the smt
[19:31] divergence here
[19:32] in the
[19:34] higher low versus the lower low in
[19:36] nasdaq comparably
[19:37] and then we have the shift in market
[19:38] structure we treat it back down into the
[19:40] 15 minute fair value up here and then we
[19:41] rally once more once i saw that then i'm
[19:44] good to go i'm waiting for the afternoon
[19:46] setup
[19:48] but now watch what's happening the
[19:50] market rallies uh fall short of 41.40
[19:52] that was another level i gave in that
[19:54] little stinger video
[19:56] on my twitter feed so i'm going to come
[19:57] to the google and check that out
[19:59] and then it drops down
[20:02] into the fair value gap
[20:05] starts to rally but look what it does it
[20:06] leaves these smooth relative equal highs
[20:09] and then does what drops once more below
[20:12] that short term low now think about what
[20:14] i've given you in your notes as it
[20:16] relates to trading the pm or afternoon
[20:18] session
[20:19] if you're bullish
[20:21] generally what will happen is the market
[20:23] has ran higher in the morning then it
[20:25] consolidates
[20:27] into the lunch hour then after the lunch
[20:29] hour
[20:30] it'll drop down and sweep to sell stops
[20:33] or below some short term low or the lows
[20:35] made in lunch
[20:37] okay
[20:38] now watch what this does here
[20:41] it creates a low
[20:43] ahead of the lunch hour at noon
[20:46] then it drops down into the fairbank gap
[20:48] is that not doing what i gave you in
[20:51] terms of the rules of what liquidity is
[20:53] doing
[20:54] in the afternoon
[20:56] post new york lunch when we're bullish
[20:58] yes
[20:59] what's different
[21:01] it's not consolidating
[21:03] see that
[21:04] is this a consolidation no it's a
[21:06] retracement so if you can identify an
[21:08] area where it's likely to retrace and
[21:09] some of you asked on the twitter feed
[21:12] why am i measuring from here to here to
[21:15] get this
[21:16] versus this here to here well you have
[21:19] to bring in what i'm trying to do i'm
[21:21] training the daily range i'm trying to
[21:23] get the majority or the alliance portion
[21:25] of the daily range
[21:26] so because i'm doing that
[21:28] i'm factoring in that
[21:30] midnight opening price so we've went
[21:33] above it here
[21:34] and once more so i'm not expecting it to
[21:37] go back down below here again so to
[21:39] refer to this low now
[21:41] again is
[21:43] pointless i'm going to use this one here
[21:45] for market structure so market structure
[21:47] swing low here to swing high that's my
[21:50] dealing range so that's why i outlined
[21:52] that one here
[21:53] okay and i gave you that small little
[21:55] rectangle here drawing my attention in
[21:56] there in the video here to go back what
[21:58] i mentioned moments ago that that's an
[22:00] old imbalance and it may
[22:03] stall here it may fail here
[22:05] it may just consolidate and then run for
[22:08] previous days high
[22:10] you know on wednesday
[22:12] so i want to take half my trade off
[22:13] which is what i which is basically what
[22:15] you saw me do
[22:16] but anyway it's taking out that short
[22:18] term low on a retracement but if it was
[22:20] consolidating into lunch i would look
[22:23] for the swing lows during the lunch hour
[22:25] and then wait for it to drop down sweep
[22:27] them like it's doing here and then rally
[22:29] but because this is a retracement
[22:31] going into lunch
[22:33] that to me
[22:35] it signals that they're going to work
[22:36] through lunch
[22:38] what does that mean years ago when we
[22:41] were on the floor only open outcry
[22:43] sometimes the floor traders
[22:46] would know that the mark was in a hurry
[22:48] it's a fast market so they're not going
[22:50] off the floor they're going to stay busy
[22:52] on the floor and they're gonna be
[22:53] trading
[22:54] so
[22:55] i learned this from an actual floor
[22:57] trader so i'm i'm not making it up i'm
[22:59] not you know listen you just giving you
[23:02] some kind of garbage made up or some
[23:04] contrived nonsense
[23:07] it's based on what they used to do
[23:09] and
[23:11] that same mentality has been
[23:13] transferred into electronic trading so
[23:15] the algorithm does that same thing here
[23:17] during the lunch hour if it's a fast
[23:19] market it's retracing back down in to a
[23:21] random
[23:22] fair value gap it creates a short term
[23:24] low and then it runs the only short term
[23:26] low that's there from here to here
[23:28] this is too narrow
[23:30] we don't want that it's already moved
[23:31] too much
[23:32] and it's going into that hour ahead of
[23:35] lunch time
[23:36] noon
[23:37] to one
[23:38] new york local time
[23:39] so i want to see it retrace back down
[23:41] into a discount how is that done from
[23:43] that low to high so the algorithm
[23:45] reprices to a discount once it gets to
[23:48] here
[23:49] then it does what
[23:50] creates that short term low rallies a
[23:52] little bit leaves smooth highs in here
[23:55] so what is that they think that is
[23:57] resistance so anyone that's short they
[23:59] treat their stop loss here
[24:01] and drops one more time right below that
[24:03] short term level what's below that short
[24:04] term low i have already told you here
[24:06] cell stops
[24:08] so i'm thinking
[24:10] like smart money
[24:12] this is going to go higher in the
[24:13] afternoon
[24:14] i didn't take anything in here in the
[24:16] morning and i was not correct in where i
[24:19] thought it could reach for which is 40
[24:20] 70. if it would have went to 40 70 you
[24:22] know what i would have done said there's
[24:24] your 40-70 and you would have asked did
[24:26] you take a trade
[24:28] or the cynics would have said but you
[24:29] didn't take a trade
[24:31] that's not what i'm trying to teach you
[24:33] i'm not trying to teach you entries i'm
[24:35] teaching you the logic on how to read
[24:36] the markets that way once you get this
[24:38] skill set down the entries are the
[24:40] easiest thing to do
[24:42] they're that's the easiest thing to do
[24:44] but you have to know how to read the
[24:46] market and also tell when the market's
[24:47] turning
[24:49] and what is if it's turning where's it
[24:50] gonna go
[24:51] and if it's gonna go higher where will
[24:53] setups form i showed you that today
[24:57] right on twitter
[24:59] right there in front of everybody
[25:01] now
[25:02] the market drops down into the sell
[25:05] stops here and it's inside that fair
[25:07] value got and it's happening
[25:09] in the lunch hour
[25:11] now i had things i'd take care of and i
[25:13] was going to be away from the screens as
[25:15] i was
[25:17] and i didn't think i'd be back before
[25:18] two o'clock but i was managing that
[25:21] trade
[25:22] from my cell phone and you can see that
[25:24] cell phone
[25:26] trade management in the short little
[25:28] vignette you can see the stops being
[25:30] raised and i'm taking partials along the
[25:32] way the whole business
[25:34] but as it's going up into this area here
[25:36] i'm taking
[25:37] some of the contracts off
[25:39] and i'm raising the stop loss up
[25:41] because i don't want it to come back
[25:42] down into that fair value gap again
[25:43] because what it done is once
[25:45] twice it should never come back down
[25:47] that again if it does i'm wrong and i
[25:50] don't want to be a part of that trade if
[25:51] i'm in a position that's still open or
[25:53] have a partial open from the original
[25:55] position after partials have been taken
[25:58] then i'm going to kill the trade
[26:00] and i'll move to the sidelines
[26:02] but the main thing i want you to
[26:03] understand about this is
[26:05] i'm not trading the model that i'm
[26:07] teaching on youtube and you're probably
[26:08] going to say well why don't you just
[26:09] trade the model michael why don't you
[26:11] just teach us how to use the model i am
[26:14] when the model speaks i'm going to show
[26:15] you but i'm also teaching you how
[26:18] you still learn to read price when the
[26:20] model isn't giving you a setup
[26:22] because
[26:23] every single
[26:24] market isn't going to give you that
[26:26] model's entry
[26:28] setup and framework every single day
[26:30] every single session
[26:32] and because i'm the author of these
[26:33] concepts i don't have a limitation to
[26:36] just that one so
[26:37] is it beneficial for you to have me say
[26:40] nothing when the model says nothing
[26:42] or is it beneficial for me to teach you
[26:44] how to read price action
[26:46] how to get in sync and learn how to
[26:48] change gears when the market shows you
[26:51] it's time to change gears
[26:53] i think that's a little bit better
[26:55] expectation
[26:56] on the part of a student
[26:59] with that of us a mentor that has the
[27:02] experience i'm trying to share with you
[27:04] so there's there's two camps that's
[27:05] going to be looking at this video and
[27:07] they're going to say
[27:09] he's not really good teacher because
[27:10] he's not focusing on the model when i'm
[27:13] telling you the model didn't do anything
[27:14] today in this index so
[27:17] what did i lean on
[27:19] my experience my ability and the
[27:21] concepts that are already taught in this
[27:23] youtube channel
[27:24] so
[27:26] one of the
[27:27] twitter followers mentioned today that
[27:29] uh
[27:30] can
[27:31] they use
[27:32] time frames outside of the one through
[27:34] five minute chart
[27:35] but use the same logic yes
[27:38] yes that's all i'm trying to do i'm
[27:40] trying to teach you a mindset that
[27:44] on the lowest time frame it gives you a
[27:45] lot of experience a lot of setups a lot
[27:47] of things to practice
[27:48] but don't limit yourself to that because
[27:50] there's so many other ways to trade
[27:53] using what i'm teaching you and you can
[27:54] scale it to whatever time frame and
[27:55] every whatever chart you want to use it
[27:56] on okay but you still have to understand
[27:58] what price is likely to do and where is
[28:00] it drawing to okay so let's talk a
[28:02] little bit about narrative
[28:04] when the market shifted here bullishly
[28:06] and it came back down into that 50
[28:08] minute time frame fair value and then
[28:09] rallied this right here told me that
[28:12] they want to set this up for a bullish
[28:14] run in the afternoon why go back to that
[28:17] daily chart remember we were inside this
[28:19] shaded area here that's the fair value
[28:21] gap did i did not shade when we were
[28:22] looking at the daily chart naked at the
[28:24] beginning of the video
[28:26] if you shade that on your own chart
[28:27] you'll see when you drop down the lower
[28:28] time frame five minute chart yours will
[28:30] look like this
[28:32] so it dips down into that lower end of
[28:33] that ferrari gap and it rallies trades
[28:36] back down into the 15 minute time frame
[28:38] fair value got which is what that is
[28:39] here
[28:40] then it rallies now right away in my
[28:43] mind
[28:44] this tells me that the algorithm is
[28:46] priming itself for an afternoon run to
[28:49] potentially previous day's high which is
[28:51] this level up here okay
[28:53] so from here right when it crossed over
[28:57] here i'm thinking okay it could
[28:59] potentially be running previous days
[29:00] high i don't know yet then when it drops
[29:02] down into here and then rallies from
[29:04] that then i know it
[29:06] now that's narrative
[29:08] okay
[29:09] by itself it doesn't mean go in here and
[29:11] buy it because hey the narrative says
[29:12] it's going to probably run to previous
[29:14] days high because i could see
[29:16] myself stopped out if i'm premature i
[29:18] want to see something that makes sense
[29:19] logically so that means do we see
[29:21] displacement yeah we do
[29:23] is that an energetic price run oh yeah
[29:25] it is
[29:26] then that low to that high i want to get
[29:28] that measurement for premium to discount
[29:30] and what do i want to wait for
[29:32] a discount
[29:34] so i measured from that low to that high
[29:36] in that short little vignette video on
[29:38] my twitter feed
[29:39] and 50 and went below that and that's
[29:41] the fair value gap so it trades down
[29:43] into here creates a short term low and
[29:45] then drops into it here now what happens
[29:47] if it went here and rallied okay well i
[29:49] would have missed a move
[29:51] but i'm looking for sell side liquidity
[29:53] i want to see a stop run
[29:55] because what that's doing and how this
[29:58] fits into narrative is if i'm thinking
[30:00] that this move here to here and then
[30:01] retracing down is setting up an
[30:03] afternoon run to potentially this level
[30:05] here by the close of the day
[30:08] i want to be like smart money and do
[30:10] what
[30:12] buy
[30:13] sell stops that is buying sell side
[30:15] liquidity
[30:17] my order
[30:18] as it's underneath here i fill right
[30:20] here
[30:21] i'm buying it on this candle right there
[30:23] i think you probably don't believe me
[30:24] i'm going to show you the candlesticks
[30:25] in a minute but i drop down into it i go
[30:28] long there
[30:29] and then i wait for it to rally up so it
[30:31] starts to rally up it consolidates a
[30:33] little bit in here and then
[30:35] to almost come out above this high and
[30:37] it creates a little small little
[30:39] consolidation and then pumps it through
[30:41] the old high and the 4140 level
[30:45] creates a short-term high rallies once
[30:47] more i draw a line on here because i
[30:48] want to see if price can be supported by
[30:50] that down closed candle
[30:52] that's an order block it trades through
[30:54] it and once it did that
[30:56] i mixed the trade okay i have taken a
[30:59] lot of the trade off through here
[31:01] and i'm also
[31:03] in an environment still inside that
[31:04] daily range
[31:06] of multiple days on the daily chart
[31:09] where
[31:11] it might not go to previous days high
[31:12] today so this might be it and it might
[31:14] need to
[31:15] use wednesday's trading so that was my
[31:17] thought process for closing the trading
[31:20] and protecting my stop loss which never
[31:21] would have been hit because the stock
[31:22] was below here
[31:24] but it came down closed in this very
[31:26] very gap
[31:27] rallied again this is an optimal trade
[31:29] entry once more
[31:30] pushing it higher but still did not hit
[31:32] the previous day's high now think about
[31:34] this folks
[31:35] think
[31:36] at the beginning of the day i tweeted
[31:37] public knowledge i want to see initially
[31:40] if it wants to make a run down the 40-70
[31:42] okay
[31:43] and as soon as i tweeted it it was like
[31:46] off the races it goes
[31:49] right in here boom and then boom and
[31:52] then drifted down to it here and it made
[31:54] a low of 40 76 even
[31:58] didn't break out below the fair value
[32:00] gap that's formed on the daily chart
[32:02] that's again that shaded area here
[32:04] and
[32:05] i'd have this tweet here so you can see
[32:07] that's the time at 10 35 that's when i
[32:08] said no yesterday's high so
[32:12] that is
[32:13] there on
[32:15] this candle and here 10 35 i'm tweeting
[32:18] note previous days high
[32:20] so i'm drawing your attention up here
[32:23] so if a retracement comes back down into
[32:25] what i shared in that video beforehand
[32:27] before it even came down here i'm
[32:29] showing you this
[32:31] and
[32:32] i gave you this level up here as
[32:34] previous days high in chart format in
[32:37] the video showing you that this is where
[32:38] my my mindset is i'm thinking think up
[32:41] here this is where it's going to draw to
[32:43] likely
[32:44] and it's going to retrace down to this
[32:45] level here so right away this should
[32:47] tell you that for the folks that are
[32:48] paying attention
[32:50] ict says
[32:51] that it's probably going to go up in the
[32:53] afternoon
[32:54] and it's probably going to gravitate
[32:56] towards this level up here which is
[32:57] previously high and he's showing this
[32:59] level here
[33:01] where he's taught optimal trade entry
[33:03] fair value gap when it goes down to here
[33:05] it's in what a discount so we're moving
[33:07] from a discount
[33:08] to buy liquidity
[33:11] so the premium array is up here the
[33:13] discount array is here doesn't it make
[33:15] sense
[33:16] for you to anticipate the move or
[33:19] originating basically from here
[33:21] running above here taking a partial and
[33:23] seeing if it can gravitate towards the
[33:25] high yes
[33:26] so you studied that way so that's what i
[33:28] do with my students in my private group
[33:30] that's what i'm doing with you okay
[33:33] folks listen
[33:35] i've had
[33:36] thousands of emails
[33:38] come to me in the last couple months
[33:40] asking
[33:42] to let you all in my private group
[33:45] my private group is done i don't even
[33:46] make videos for them anymore okay we
[33:49] just chit chat on a forum now that's all
[33:51] it is i'm teaching mentorship right here
[33:53] for free you don't have to have a paypal
[33:55] account you don't have to give me a
[33:57] credit card number you don't have to
[33:58] worry about missing your payment
[34:00] nothing all you have to do is show up
[34:03] every time i do this or show up over
[34:06] there on twitter see what i'm doing over
[34:07] there
[34:08] and
[34:09] i promise you
[34:11] if you stick with it the things i'm
[34:12] teaching you
[34:14] work they were i absolutely used this
[34:17] logic today i didn't
[34:19] create something new today this is
[34:21] exactly what i'm teaching you
[34:23] as a mentorship
[34:25] this is it
[34:26] i did the very thing i'm teaching you
[34:28] with
[34:29] so that way you can see uh put a button
[34:31] was pushed
[34:34] do i need to put a trade on every single
[34:35] day to teach you now
[34:38] will i continue to show trades yes
[34:42] will you be accepted into my private
[34:43] group no
[34:45] so please don't ask okay that community
[34:48] is closed to them
[34:49] and
[34:50] you are all benefiting and believe me
[34:53] they're learning along with you with
[34:55] this mentorship
[34:57] paid members that went through my
[34:59] private group they're learning things
[35:01] just like you are right here
[35:04] because i'm taking things and
[35:05] simplifying them
[35:07] if i let you all into that group
[35:10] and took all of your money
[35:12] you would all be confused okay because
[35:14] there's so many things it's very very
[35:16] detailed i have simplified it here
[35:20] that's all i've done i've made it very
[35:22] simple so that we can go in look at
[35:23] these things and make it applicable
[35:25] because you need to learn how to do this
[35:28] before it gets hard
[35:31] and it's going to get real hard folks
[35:33] read between the lines and think about
[35:34] what i'm saying look around the world's
[35:36] changing okay
[35:37] so put in the time
[35:40] don't rush it you don't need to worry
[35:42] about taking a year to learn how to do
[35:44] this i've streamlined this okay
[35:47] i'm here
[35:48] until the good lord takes me or takes
[35:50] away my mental faculties i'm on youtube
[35:53] okay i'm on twitter i love doing this
[35:57] i love being back in this capacity i'm
[36:00] free to do what i want to do i'm
[36:02] enjoying myself and all of you both
[36:04] private membership and public mentorship
[36:07] you're all benefiting from it and i'm
[36:08] having fun with you so don't mess it all
[36:10] up by stressing me out asking me to join
[36:13] a group that i'm not going to let you
[36:14] join anyway and i don't want your money
[36:15] so stop asking me
[36:17] so anyway
[36:19] uh this is where we're at right now i
[36:21] think we'll probably want to sweep up
[36:22] here maybe that might even happen
[36:23] tonight during the asian session but
[36:26] let's take a look at the
[36:28] executions
[36:32] and on this candle here the low on this
[36:34] candle look at this figure right here
[36:36] okay
[36:38] that low is 411 even
[36:42] and the low on this candle
[36:45] comes in at 4108 and a quarter
[36:48] and my fill
[36:50] 41 10 and a quarter below
[36:54] that low whoops i'm sorry i'm doing the
[36:55] wrong i'm doing the wrong one
[36:57] the low is 41 10 and a half
[37:01] and then my
[37:02] candle of entry was here the low was 41
[37:05] 0 8 and a quarter and my fill was still
[37:08] below that it's 41 10 and a quarter so
[37:10] one quarter point below that okay
[37:12] so there's the entry right there
[37:16] and then
[37:17] partial here
[37:20] another partial there so half the
[37:22] position cup up 10 contracts
[37:24] on this price and took out took off half
[37:26] in that area where that rectangle was
[37:28] drawn in that little vignette video okay
[37:31] again i'm doing this folks
[37:33] look back over here
[37:37] see this area over here
[37:39] and these relative equal highs i'm
[37:41] thinking that it could do this and maybe
[37:42] this might be a failure swing right and
[37:44] then go lower so i'm taking off half in
[37:47] the event that i'm possibly wrong
[37:49] so that's why i did that
[37:51] and you understand that
[37:54] and i took another partial off here i
[37:55] tweeted and paid the trader
[37:59] okay so three contracts there at 41 34
[38:02] and a half
[38:03] and then i waited for it to pump up
[38:04] through this old high and the 4140 level
[38:09] at 41 41 and a half
[38:11] now actually i was like
[38:13] three seconds late i was waiting for it
[38:15] to give me a nice big candle and if you
[38:17] watch the vignette video i did i
[38:19] i sell the uh
[38:22] the one contract and then it gives that
[38:24] little bit of a ramped up expansion on
[38:26] the candle so i'm like ah i just would
[38:28] have waited one more you know one more
[38:30] moment it could have gave me a better
[38:31] feel but whatever and then here is me
[38:34] closing the
[38:35] remaining one contract because i was
[38:37] concerned it was going to take the stop
[38:39] and i didn't want it to stop out i'd
[38:41] rather take my price at my own exit and
[38:43] not let the stop out occur but it never
[38:45] would have hit it here and just
[38:47] rebalance that and then at the old high
[38:49] it round again but still fail to get to
[38:51] my objective on the day but this was the
[38:53] draw on liquidity now think about what
[38:55] i've shown here
[38:56] i was wrong on this level
[38:58] and i was wrong on the 40-70 level
[39:01] but i was able to trade and take the
[39:03] lions portion of the move in the middle
[39:05] that's all you need you don't need to be
[39:08] in here doing
[39:10] the absolute highest high and the lowest
[39:12] low you don't need to do that
[39:14] okay the folks are asking me can you
[39:15] teach me to do that you don't need to
[39:17] look at this
[39:18] wouldn't this keep you
[39:20] from going hungry
[39:22] i mean i think it would
[39:23] i mean this is good eating here i mean
[39:25] this is a nice move it makes sense and i
[39:28] don't need this level to get profitable
[39:32] hold high
[39:33] yes yes and yes
[39:36] okay
[39:36] so
[39:38] i mentioned i'll go into the smt
[39:40] diversions in here so let's do that now
[39:42] all right so i'm adding the little
[39:43] compare tab it's a little plus symbol up
[39:45] here if you go into your trading view
[39:47] click on it it'll give you the drop down
[39:49] menu for what
[39:50] instrument or market you want to compare
[39:52] it to
[39:53] and you use
[39:54] nqm2022 this is going to change to nqu
[39:59] 2022 and this symbol for s p will
[40:01] eventually in a
[40:03] few days change
[40:05] to
[40:07] esu 2022 and it will be basically
[40:12] tracking the september delivery contract
[40:14] of both indices right now we're in the
[40:16] month of june and it's about to roll
[40:18] over so what we do is we monitor
[40:22] chart i'm sorry bartchart.com and
[40:24] whenever the open interest is larger
[40:26] in the september contract than that of
[40:28] the june contract that's when i roll
[40:31] over so that's
[40:33] how i do it
[40:34] it's a little different from everybody
[40:35] else i'm sure but that's what it is i'm
[40:37] doing when i'm rolling over into the
[40:39] next month
[40:40] because these months or these contracts
[40:42] they expire okay so june won't be traded
[40:45] anymore in a couple days
[40:46] and september will and we'll trade
[40:48] september until
[40:50] a week or so into september and then
[40:52] we'll roll over to the december contract
[40:54] because september will expire
[40:56] all right so anyway uh with the compare
[40:58] tab
[40:59] you're putting in this symbol here as a
[41:01] selection in the drop down menu and once
[41:04] it's down here you click on a little
[41:05] gear
[41:06] and make sure it's highlighted low
[41:08] because what we're doing is we're
[41:09] comparing and contrasting the lows
[41:13] inside of a fair value gap after a
[41:14] retracement into a discount when we're
[41:16] expecting to potentially trade up in
[41:17] here i'm speaking like you knew this
[41:19] okay that's how you're supposed to talk
[41:20] to yourself in your journal
[41:22] this low versus this low you see that
[41:24] lower low
[41:25] is that seen here
[41:27] low high or low
[41:30] we're comparing lows so when we're
[41:31] bullish we're plotting this line down
[41:34] here
[41:36] as a compare
[41:37] and contrast tool
[41:39] and it's smt smart money tool or smart
[41:41] money technique i never really settled
[41:43] on what the t was going to be so that's
[41:45] why i always say it like that but it's
[41:47] my way of measuring
[41:49] real accumulation distribution so if we
[41:51] know that this area down here is a
[41:53] discount and we know this is an
[41:55] imbalance fair value gap it trades down
[41:57] into a pool of liquidity below that low
[41:58] as cell stops and i want to buy sell
[42:01] stops like i've mentioned here i'm
[42:02] buying the sell stops
[42:04] inside the fair value gap during a
[42:06] classic by day which is open at midnight
[42:08] trade down create the low of the day
[42:10] rally and then creates an optimal trade
[42:13] entry or fair value gap or you're going
[42:15] to buy the short term low
[42:18] during smt diversions
[42:20] okay so there's real accumulation here
[42:22] between the nasdaq and s p
[42:25] so this tells me that the nasdaq is
[42:27] failing to go lower so it's under
[42:28] accumulation and this is just a stop
[42:30] hunt below that short-term low
[42:33] see that
[42:34] now some of you are like you know this
[42:35] is really complicated ict you know i
[42:37] really like the optimal trade entry and
[42:39] these fair value gaps are all over the
[42:40] place how do i know which one is the one
[42:41] i want to use okay check this out a lot
[42:44] of you know how to use optimal trade
[42:46] entry you'll use the low here to the
[42:48] high pull your fib up 62 to 79 level if
[42:52] it goes down to that then you'll buy it
[42:53] okay that's one pattern
[42:55] but now watch what else there is this is
[42:57] turtle suit you have a low
[42:59] lower low by the low
[43:01] that's being violated
[43:03] with optimal trade entry see that
[43:06] or you can just do this
[43:08] low high
[43:10] find the fair value got below 50 level
[43:12] which is a discount as soon as it trades
[43:13] at the top level of it hit it there
[43:16] buy it there stop below the lower low
[43:19] or level here
[43:21] there's your there's your pattern
[43:24] see that
[43:26] or
[43:27] you can do this
[43:30] you can
[43:31] wait for it to trade down into this like
[43:33] that and then find the swing high prior
[43:35] to trading into the fair value gap and
[43:37] put a buy stop there as your entry
[43:41] and whatever the lowest low is after it
[43:43] hits that
[43:44] that's where your stop loss would be
[43:46] just right below that and you can be
[43:48] buying strength
[43:49] that's not in my opinion the
[43:51] preferred entry strategy but i'll just
[43:53] give you a bunch of them
[43:55] but it's using what
[43:58] bias that has been corrected and
[44:02] calibrated based on what the market has
[44:04] done here at key times
[44:06] okay so it at 9 30 the market does what
[44:08] it brings us that volatility we look for
[44:12] so it shifts higher after we have
[44:14] another smt diversions
[44:16] here
[44:18] but we have that shift higher
[44:21] it's showing us real accumulation in the
[44:23] s p it rallies i don't want to chase
[44:25] that
[44:26] i wait for it to come back down into a
[44:28] 50 minute time frame
[44:29] fair value gap which it does
[44:31] now am i still buying it there i could i
[44:33] absolutely could do that but i'm not
[44:35] willing to
[44:36] because i want to know that what i
[44:39] thought initially which was 40 70 it
[44:41] could still wipe out that low it's early
[44:43] on in the day
[44:45] so i'm gonna i'm going to wait for the
[44:46] market to really communicate to me that
[44:48] the algorithm is pricing in a
[44:50] narrative
[44:52] that the afternoon session is bullish
[44:54] that's it i'm going to give up the
[44:56] morning session folks
[44:57] see
[44:58] just because i'm sitting in front of
[44:59] charts doesn't mean i'm taking a trade
[45:02] because
[45:02] guess what
[45:05] that gum i'm gonna take a trade because
[45:06] i've been here all day and i deserve one
[45:10] it doesn't work like that you have to
[45:12] wait and be patient there's more time
[45:14] waiting in between the setups than
[45:16] actually doing anything
[45:18] and then it's funny
[45:20] you have to have
[45:21] incredible patience in both stages you
[45:24] have to be very patient waiting for the
[45:25] setup and then once you get in the trade
[45:27] you have to be patient and let the trade
[45:29] pan out
[45:31] once it comes in the 50 minute time
[45:33] frame here then it rallies like this
[45:35] then
[45:37] then
[45:38] i'm comfortable
[45:39] knowing what i'm looking for what is
[45:41] that
[45:42] dealing range low dealing range high fib
[45:45] across it fifty percent below that
[45:46] here's a fair value got trade down into
[45:48] it i wanna buy sell stops
[45:51] that's just me
[45:52] i wanna do it because it really
[45:54] fortifies the setup it allows me to get
[45:57] in where the smart money will be buying
[46:00] that little movement here i'm buying
[46:01] that very candle i didn't buy the next
[46:03] candle i didn't buy the candle before
[46:05] that
[46:06] i bought below that price
[46:08] 41 10 and a half i bought it at 41 10
[46:11] and a quarter
[46:13] the things i'm teaching you i'm pushing
[46:15] a button
[46:16] it's a really real instance of happening
[46:19] not something i took a trade and you
[46:21] never see that happening
[46:23] okay
[46:24] i'm showing you example after example
[46:27] after example of the things i'm teaching
[46:29] you and i'm using the logic i'm not
[46:31] creating some falsehood i'm not scamming
[46:34] you i'm not frauding you i'm not doing
[46:36] anything except for teaching you what
[46:38] works what makes these markets book and
[46:40] they do it every single week
[46:43] the same kind of stuff all the time
[46:46] smt diversions here you see that
[46:48] smt divergence here lower low
[46:50] higher low here we have the lower low in
[46:53] nasdaq higher low in s p
[46:56] that sets the stage for that run higher
[46:59] okay
[47:02] i could literally go on and on for about
[47:04] four more hours just in this chart but i
[47:07] promised myself i wouldn't make these
[47:08] videos very long and i know some of you
[47:10] really want those long ones back
[47:12] but
[47:13] i look at the
[47:14] statistics on my videos and the
[47:16] attention spans about 10 minutes each
[47:18] video
[47:19] so i'm gonna try my best to stay in that
[47:22] vicinity
[47:23] can't promise but i'm certainly going to
[47:25] do it as much as i can and i'm certainly
[47:28] obviously well beyond that that
[47:30] limitation here but i know a lot of you
[47:32] press that uh two times the speed
[47:35] uh function on the videos
[47:37] and i get it if you ever listen to me in
[47:39] a forced uh live session i sound like a
[47:42] different guy don't i that's because i
[47:43] don't have that sped up chipmunk sound
[47:45] that you guys usually put me on
[47:47] but that's cool i understand everybody's
[47:49] time is important but hopefully you
[47:50] found something in this insightful
[47:51] hopefully you're encouraged by me
[47:53] actually showing it working and not just
[47:55] talking about something theoretically
[47:56] and again
[47:58] be safe and i'll touch base with you
[48:00] again on twitter tomorrow i'm sure and
[48:02] again on thursday in another lecture in
[48:04] the mentorship
