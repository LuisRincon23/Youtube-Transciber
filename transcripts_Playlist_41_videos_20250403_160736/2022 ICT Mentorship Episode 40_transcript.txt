[00:09] all right folks welcome back
[00:11] this is going to be kind of like the
[00:13] direction we're going to be going in the
[00:15] future with the channel here
[00:17] i'm wrapping up the mentorship teachings
[00:21] for this model
[00:22] and we'll be just basically doing
[00:25] reviews and
[00:27] index futures
[00:29] forex
[00:30] commodities one and it's applicable and
[00:32] i posted that on
[00:34] twitter that's kind of like a short
[00:36] little promo
[00:38] and everybody was excited thinking that
[00:40] i'm gonna be doing like
[00:42] 30 different markets every single day
[00:45] it's not what i'm doing
[00:46] so kind of give you a flavor for what it
[00:49] is that we will be doing uh the
[00:53] mentorship group that i have with us a
[00:56] private group i no longer make videos
[00:58] for them
[00:59] and one of the reasons why i started
[01:02] this
[01:03] project here
[01:04] is to steer people away from wanting to
[01:07] buy videos that aren't going to help you
[01:09] anyway so when you're buying old videos
[01:12] i'm talking about market moves for that
[01:14] particular day
[01:16] so it's not going to be as useful to you
[01:19] so to keep people
[01:21] from profiting off of pirated videos
[01:24] i stopped making videos in my private
[01:26] group
[01:27] and i make them here publicly
[01:29] now
[01:30] some of my students are upset that i did
[01:32] that
[01:33] others that understand why i'm doing it
[01:36] are in support of it i'm not going to
[01:38] argue or
[01:39] wrestle with the
[01:41] opinions of who's in support of and who
[01:43] isn't supportive i look at it this way
[01:45] the folks that would have an issue with
[01:46] it they're probably the ones that are
[01:48] trying to sell pirated videos so now
[01:50] i've removed their market
[01:52] so you're a fool if you're going out
[01:54] there and you're buying all these
[01:55] instagram guys that are selling my
[01:57] videos i got ict mentorship 2021 2022
[02:01] 2020 19 all the way back to 2016.
[02:04] you know folks
[02:05] they're not going to help you
[02:07] because you weren't there
[02:09] when it was given at the time it was
[02:11] given
[02:12] that's being mentored so that's what i'm
[02:14] kind of doing here and i do on my
[02:16] twitter account
[02:17] so
[02:19] that way we understand why i'm doing it
[02:21] and what motivates me to do it
[02:24] so
[02:25] there won't be a lot of markets
[02:26] obviously being covered each day i'll be
[02:29] looking at the markets that i was
[02:31] referring to either on twitter or i
[02:33] actually took trades in so it's not a
[02:35] matter of talking about something
[02:37] that no one expected me to have an
[02:39] interest in
[02:41] which is predominantly what you see here
[02:43] on
[02:44] youtube and
[02:45] instagram and
[02:47] twitter and
[02:49] facebook and
[02:50] discord and
[02:51] you know
[02:52] it's the list goes on and on
[02:55] so
[02:56] today
[02:57] one minute before 8 30. i apologize i
[02:59] was
[03:00] waiting for my
[03:01] phone to update it's software and by the
[03:05] time i got back on to twitter i had one
[03:08] minute left to type out everything that
[03:10] i posted and you can go my twitter feed
[03:12] and you'll actually see the post in here
[03:13] too
[03:14] but
[03:16] on the economic calendar
[03:18] there was a high impact news driver for
[03:20] canadian dollar and i said i would start
[03:22] working in forex when there's a lot of
[03:24] you are
[03:25] specifically interested in forex because
[03:28] that's predominantly what i'm known for
[03:30] i've moved away from forex recently
[03:32] because i wanted to be a part of the
[03:34] stock index futures market and i'm still
[03:37] engaged obviously in that i did some
[03:39] live trades today and i'll share some of
[03:41] that with you as well
[03:42] but i was covering the canadian dollar
[03:45] and what i was
[03:46] outlining is kind of like
[03:48] this idea and we're gonna use it also to
[03:50] work within the scope of the teaching on
[03:54] daily bias and we'll get into that in a
[03:56] later time in this video but right away
[03:58] when you look on the left hand side this
[03:59] chart here is a dollar cad
[04:03] daily chart and on the right hand side
[04:04] it's the hourly chart of the same pair
[04:06] dollar cut
[04:08] notice that we saw last week the market
[04:10] traded up
[04:12] just bumped the short-term high here
[04:15] with that daily high
[04:18] what do we see
[04:20] once that occurred
[04:21] what formed on that daily chart
[04:24] you want to pause the video here
[04:31] all right if you need more time
[04:33] pause the video because i'm about to
[04:34] continue
[04:38] when the market ran
[04:40] into that old high here
[04:42] it hit it then the next day it created a
[04:44] lower
[04:46] high candle
[04:47] so we have one candle
[04:49] a higher candle high here on candle two
[04:52] and candle three or day three so this is
[04:54] what i dub a swing high
[04:57] i'm not using a williams fractal on mt4
[05:00] i don't use mt4
[05:02] this is not mt4 platform and five
[05:05] candles if you're waiting for five
[05:06] candles you missed the boat
[05:08] so
[05:09] this
[05:10] swing high at an old high
[05:13] did it run it
[05:15] not by much but it did
[05:17] that movement right here shown clearly
[05:19] on the hourly chart and the following
[05:21] day creating a high that has a lower
[05:24] high than the highest one that ran into
[05:26] that old high
[05:27] so we have a three bar pattern
[05:30] one candle the lower candle to the left
[05:32] a lower candle to the right that's a
[05:34] swing high
[05:35] pretty simple stuff
[05:37] then the next day
[05:38] i'm going to be expecting the market to
[05:40] trade lower
[05:42] now here's the problem
[05:44] with this particular market
[05:47] yes it's likely to trade down and with
[05:49] the benefit of hindsight i'm showing you
[05:50] here but again i tweeted about this
[05:52] beforehand
[05:53] so at 8 29 a.m eastern standard time
[05:57] you can see that is on my twitter feed
[06:01] if it's dropping down we have this down
[06:03] close candle here
[06:04] so it could be met with some resistance
[06:08] digging into this range of this down
[06:10] closed candle
[06:11] about half of its body right in here
[06:15] and
[06:16] not surprising you can see that's pretty
[06:18] much where we close that candle here on
[06:20] the 21st of june 2022.
[06:23] so when we look at this dashed line here
[06:25] what i'm anchoring to is the opening on
[06:27] this down closed candle because that is
[06:28] a bullish order block now
[06:30] i'm not suggesting that we went into
[06:32] that to go higher
[06:34] i'm just saying that as we started this
[06:36] down move
[06:38] it's digging into this candle so that's
[06:40] going to be
[06:42] the impediment to a big sudden one big
[06:44] candle that would take us down into this
[06:46] area here and clear out this
[06:49] so over to the hourly chart
[06:51] you can see
[06:52] last week we ran up into it started
[06:55] drifting lower
[06:56] fair bay gap here it rebalances to that
[06:58] drops back down consolidates between
[07:00] this high and the low here comes back in
[07:05] drops once more attacking the cell stops
[07:07] here
[07:09] consolidates once more
[07:11] breaks
[07:12] digs into that order block
[07:15] again that's this level here
[07:17] so watch what happens it goes into it
[07:19] overnight
[07:21] then it rallies
[07:23] this rally here is ahead of
[07:25] the 830 news driver
[07:27] on the economic counter you can find it
[07:29] on 4xfactory.com
[07:32] but this movement here this is
[07:35] all manipulation
[07:37] that takes us up into an imbalance here
[07:39] a fair value gap running a short term
[07:41] high
[07:42] buy side has been taken when it runs
[07:43] here
[07:44] that's anchored above this short-term
[07:45] high
[07:51] the chart on the left here is a
[07:53] 15-minute time frame for a dollar cad
[07:55] and the chart on the right is a five
[07:57] minute chart
[08:02] on the economic account you can see at 8
[08:03] 30 in the morning
[08:05] june 21st 2022 we had a high impact news
[08:09] driver for core retail sales
[08:11] and medium impact retail sales number
[08:14] yellow events i'm not interested in
[08:18] red or medium impact high or medium
[08:21] impact
[08:22] those are the news drivers i'm looking
[08:23] for so if we look at the
[08:25] price movement
[08:28] on the five minute chart
[08:30] you can see that once we
[08:32] ran up initially at seven o'clock in the
[08:34] morning what is seven o'clock in the
[08:35] morning new york time that's the
[08:37] beginning of my ict new york
[08:39] kill zone
[08:41] it's extended to 10 o'clock in the
[08:42] morning when it's 4x
[08:45] so 7 o'clock to 10
[08:46] in the morning near the local time
[08:49] the market creates a short-term high
[08:51] then runs above that so we have buy side
[08:53] taken then the market
[08:56] drops just below here but i want to have
[08:57] a more meaningful
[08:59] displacement
[09:00] okay we want to see something that's
[09:02] more energetic
[09:03] this little
[09:04] toe in the water type thing
[09:06] here that's not enough we want to see it
[09:09] fall in
[09:10] okay so it drops down that short term
[09:14] low here that's your shift in market
[09:15] structure
[09:17] energetic displacement and that candle
[09:19] is exactly when that news driver came
[09:22] out of 8 30. so all of this is news
[09:24] driver related
[09:26] economic calendar
[09:28] manipulation
[09:29] and the market is going to cause people
[09:32] to want to sell short and chase it going
[09:33] lower
[09:35] it creates a fair value gap in here
[09:38] on the five-minute chart but there also
[09:40] is a fair value gap here now ahead of
[09:42] the news
[09:43] you might be thinking well
[09:45] couldn't you have sold short here yes
[09:47] you could have but
[09:49] the economic drivers that come at 8 30
[09:51] could have sent it up higher and taken
[09:54] us into this area here so really it's a
[09:56] matter of waiting for the news to hit
[09:58] the market and then create the setup
[10:00] that's a little bit more conservative
[10:01] there are times when it's so obvious
[10:04] that
[10:05] they're going to continue the move that
[10:07] starts ahead of the new driver
[10:09] but
[10:11] it takes a little bit more experience to
[10:12] find those setups and trust them
[10:15] i would rather you use your demo account
[10:17] to see these types of moves
[10:20] real time wait for them to form and then
[10:22] go in and engage them with your demo
[10:24] not try to forecast how much of a move
[10:27] it's going to
[10:28] further increase higher or lower once
[10:29] the new driver comes out or the news
[10:31] event hits the marketplace
[10:35] relative equal lows down here there's
[10:37] your sell side
[10:39] so we had
[10:41] this fair value got
[10:42] formed after buy side was taken here but
[10:45] now this creates an area of buy side
[10:47] that once this trades lower we have this
[10:50] fair value gap and then we have this
[10:51] very value gap so it could run up into
[10:53] that level
[10:54] with the volatility
[10:56] so you have to make sure that you have
[10:58] that
[10:59] defined with your risk management
[11:02] the draw on liquidity
[11:04] is
[11:05] likely to pull down in here
[11:07] or into this
[11:08] fair value gap and we'll talk a little
[11:10] bit more about why that's the case
[11:12] but eventually it trades down into it
[11:15] bagged and tagged sells liquidity
[11:20] the tweet i posted again you can see
[11:21] this at 8 29 a.m june 21 2022
[11:25] i just made it on twitter but basically
[11:28] saying good morning folks
[11:30] dollar cad is about to have some
[11:32] volatility
[11:34] note the sell side
[11:35] and buy side on your 5 and 15 minute
[11:37] charts
[11:38] sell side is here
[11:40] buy side would be here
[11:45] study if it wants to run sell side
[11:47] before buy side or rebounds to a
[11:50] discount
[11:51] what does that mean
[11:53] at the news driver release it could go
[11:55] up and bump the buy side
[11:57] then dig in
[11:59] for the imbalance here
[12:01] that's a discount
[12:03] or run the sell side out here
[12:05] so all of this movement up
[12:07] since five o'clock in the morning
[12:09] new york local time
[12:10] this was just the head of
[12:13] that news driver here so they were
[12:15] building in a premium
[12:17] then during the new york kill zone it
[12:19] gave you the setup that i teach in this
[12:21] model
[12:22] delivered to the fair value gap and
[12:24] delivered to the south side of koji pool
[12:29] between this high
[12:30] and that low here is equilibrium so we
[12:33] have to find a discount
[12:34] array below that if we're going short
[12:37] that's the favorite a gap here
[12:39] you can take a partial there
[12:41] and target the sell side liquidity which
[12:43] you can see it does that as well here
[12:46] and here i tweeted and i failed actually
[12:49] include that tweet i wish i would have
[12:50] put it in here now but
[12:52] i mentioned how the market reacted here
[12:54] like that and i stated that's the reason
[12:56] why you want to take partials because
[12:57] you don't know if it's going to come all
[12:58] the way back up and then revisit the
[12:59] sphere of a gap and lose the opportunity
[13:02] to bank something when it goes into your
[13:04] first opportunity discount array when
[13:06] going short
[13:11] now i've dropped down into a four-minute
[13:13] chart
[13:14] and i dimmed
[13:16] the
[13:18] fair value gap that i mentioned earlier
[13:20] that you could have taken that trade but
[13:21] it'd be ahead of the news driver
[13:23] and it's a little bit more riskier but
[13:25] you wait for the displacement
[13:27] short term low is taken then we have a
[13:28] shift in market structure
[13:30] and the imbalance would be between this
[13:32] low of this candle and the high of this
[13:34] candle in here
[13:35] now by itself this is a rather elongated
[13:38] imbalance so all of this cell side
[13:41] delivery
[13:42] is imbalanced
[13:44] and there's not enough by side delivery
[13:46] so it's going to want to wait for the
[13:48] market to come back up in here
[13:50] in forex
[13:52] there is no central
[13:55] measure of volume okay and in the
[13:57] algorithm that delivers price that is
[14:00] going to want to come back up and
[14:01] overlap this down move and offer
[14:05] buyers an opportunity to get in on that
[14:08] this is too much of a movement one-sided
[14:10] so the market offers that rebalancing
[14:13] so if that's the case
[14:15] where in this range would we be looking
[14:17] for
[14:18] for an entry
[14:20] knowing that this fair value got could
[14:22] be revisited
[14:24] and you're gonna have to utilize that
[14:26] for your stop loss so your stop would
[14:28] have to be here
[14:30] doesn't matter where you're going short
[14:32] in between this low and this high
[14:34] you have to define the risk with the
[14:36] stop here
[14:38] based on the model i'm teaching you now
[14:39] some of you are like oh this is too much
[14:41] you know because if i went in at 129.45
[14:44] and i put my stop here that's almost 12
[14:47] pips
[14:48] that's too much no it's not it's all
[14:50] relative you can scale that's one of the
[14:52] benefits of forex it's very scalable
[14:54] whereas if you're trading futures you're
[14:56] kind of stuck to whatever the contract
[14:58] size is and you've got to either make it
[15:00] work or
[15:02] you can't take the trade or you're
[15:03] basically over leveraged
[15:05] which is what you don't want to be doing
[15:11] so if we look at that range from that
[15:13] high
[15:14] down to that low and drop a fib on it
[15:16] we're going to get a measurement of 50
[15:18] here that's our equilibrium price point
[15:20] so really we need price to get to that
[15:22] point or higher
[15:24] so by definition we could be looking for
[15:27] a short here
[15:30] up to here
[15:33] and that would look like that so that
[15:35] was that's really the range that you'd
[15:37] be wanting to sell short in so you're
[15:39] not really risking
[15:41] a lot of pips
[15:43] but you're defining the entry a little
[15:44] bit better even though it goes above it
[15:46] a little bit that's okay
[15:48] but the bottom line is it eventually
[15:50] gets in sync watch the bodies of the
[15:51] candle support that
[15:54] premium high of the imbalance
[15:56] beautiful delivery
[15:58] then it starts to break lower one more
[16:00] time false little rally takes
[16:03] buy side liquidity once more then the
[16:04] real move starts to unfold
[16:07] trades into the fair value gap here
[16:09] take partials so that way if this
[16:11] reverses on you you're paid
[16:14] and drops below a low
[16:16] where engineered south side liquidity
[16:18] would be and then digs into the cell
[16:20] cell equity over here
[16:23] so your entry could be
[16:25] 129.44
[16:29] 129.47
[16:31] in that range anywhere near is
[16:33] reasonable it's acceptable
[16:36] obviously the closer you get to this
[16:37] level you may not have been filled it
[16:39] might just leave some of that open and
[16:40] then start to roll over but as you can
[16:42] see here goes a little bit further
[16:43] that's fine that's why we have to
[16:44] utilize this level here for our stop
[16:46] loss based on the model's rules that
[16:49] i've taught in the 2022 youtube
[16:50] mentorship
[16:55] alright so i have
[16:56] a four minute chart here with all the
[16:59] details shown
[17:01] south side the quality pool relative
[17:03] equal lows from the morning
[17:04] it rallies up
[17:06] creates a high after running buy-side
[17:08] liquidity
[17:09] it breaks down
[17:11] consolidates and gives a short-term
[17:12] swing low here with an energetic run
[17:15] lower at the high impact news event at 8
[17:18] 30.
[17:20] rebalance
[17:22] stop goes here and it rolls over
[17:26] during the 10 o'clock till 11 o'clock
[17:28] but
[17:29] that time frame 10 to 11 that's london
[17:33] close so if you're looking for
[17:34] directional plays and you're in a trade
[17:36] you want to have about 80 percent of
[17:38] your trade off between 10 o'clock and 11
[17:41] o'clock in the morning because usually
[17:42] not all the time but usually that's when
[17:44] it creates the opposing end of the daily
[17:47] range so if it's creating the high of
[17:49] the session here the low is likely to
[17:51] form between 10 o'clock and 11 o'clock
[17:53] that's algorithmic now there are some
[17:55] times if there's news events
[17:57] sometimes canadian dollars influenced by
[18:00] crude oil numbers
[18:01] and that would sometimes skew
[18:04] this time window 10 to 11 so on those
[18:06] days when there's crude oil inventory
[18:08] numbers coming out and i'm interested in
[18:10] trading the loony
[18:12] i will trade with the expectation
[18:14] between 10 o'clock to noon
[18:16] and not have such a tight little window
[18:18] of 10 to 11. and i promise you i have
[18:21] students for days and days and days and
[18:23] years and years now that will confirm
[18:26] that this has not just been form fitted
[18:28] for this example i've always taught that
[18:30] 10 o'clock until 11 o'clock in the
[18:31] morning is london closed profit taking
[18:33] hour i'm quite sure if you go through
[18:35] the
[18:36] older teachings i have in this youtube
[18:38] channel you'll probably actually hear me
[18:40] talk about that very thing as well
[18:44] all right so we're going to talk about
[18:46] the e-mini s p futures contract this is
[18:48] the september contract for 2022. if
[18:50] you're following along on tradingview
[18:52] and i hope you are
[18:54] the symbol you would be utilizing for
[18:56] calling up the data for this contract is
[18:59] esu
[19:02] 2022 okay and that would give you this
[19:05] chart here this is a daily chart
[19:08] and before i get into it i want to talk
[19:09] a little bit about
[19:11] daily bias
[19:12] okay so
[19:15] this topic is one of the most
[19:18] requested topics that i would cover
[19:21] and i have done
[19:22] many teachings on it i've done
[19:26] amplifications i've done
[19:29] revisits to this idea
[19:31] and i know what you're wanting okay
[19:34] because it's what i wanted as well
[19:36] you want a simple abc one two three it
[19:39] always works it's always going to be the
[19:41] same way it's always going to be the
[19:42] same procedure process and it's always
[19:45] going to give you a winning trade now
[19:47] some of you are already folding your
[19:48] hands and hissing because you're like oh
[19:50] that's not what i want that's not what i
[19:51] want you're exaggerating michael no
[19:53] that's really what you want
[19:55] and you want me to give you a very
[19:57] simple cookie-cutter approach
[19:59] to find daily bias
[20:00] and i want you to understand that i've
[20:02] taught these things
[20:05] many times throughout the lessons and
[20:07] lectures and series that's found on his
[20:09] youtube channel
[20:13] this is the simplification
[20:17] that i make for daily bias if you stick
[20:20] to these rules
[20:23] you will know how to find daily bias as
[20:26] i teach it my students follow these
[20:28] rules
[20:29] okay
[20:31] i'm going to go through them with you
[20:33] and you're going to be kicking and
[20:34] screaming and saying there's something
[20:35] else you're holding back there isn't
[20:37] it's experience it's doing it yourself
[20:41] but the keys to daily bias are simply
[20:42] this
[20:44] everyday bias is unrealistic
[20:47] if i go in looking for a specific
[20:50] predetermined daily bias before the
[20:52] market starts trading invariably i'm
[20:54] going to have it incorrect
[20:57] notice i said that i'm not perfect some
[21:00] of you hold me up to this
[21:02] hero level status and i'm not a hero
[21:06] okay i'm just somebody that knows what
[21:08] they're looking for
[21:09] and knows how to avoid hopefully
[21:12] making the same mistakes over and over
[21:14] again because i'm looking for a
[21:15] procedure and process that will lead to
[21:17] an outcome that generally not all the
[21:19] time but generally yields a specific
[21:22] result
[21:24] so i'm not trying to get a daily bias
[21:26] every single day
[21:29] i'm trying to determine the likely
[21:31] weekly expansion and again what is that
[21:34] i utilize a weekly chart and i studied
[21:37] that and i want to see does it look like
[21:39] it's going to run to an old low
[21:42] does it look like it's going to run to
[21:43] an old high
[21:45] or is it running to a imbalance below
[21:48] the market price or is it trying to run
[21:49] to an imbalance above the market price
[21:53] or is it likely not to move because
[21:56] there's no data for it for that week
[21:58] and other markets have
[22:00] high impact or medium impact news that
[22:02] would be more interesting
[22:03] and the algorithm will be working those
[22:06] pairs or markets
[22:08] and
[22:09] the pairs or markets that don't have a
[22:10] high impact or medium impact driver will
[22:13] probably be a lackluster market
[22:15] environment
[22:18] i'm looking for
[22:20] the direction
[22:22] of an expansion move
[22:24] i'm not trying to get the entire weekly
[22:26] range
[22:27] i'm not trying to buy the weekly low and
[22:29] sell the weekly high i can but that's
[22:31] not what i'm trying to do you don't need
[22:33] to do that okay
[22:35] i know some of you hate when i do that
[22:37] but
[22:38] i'm trying to make sure that you
[22:39] understand there's a distinction between
[22:41] what you should be coming into this with
[22:42] in terms of expectations
[22:44] and what is realistic
[22:46] okay in the beginning
[22:47] all you're trying to do is determine is
[22:49] it likely to expand higher is there
[22:51] going to be a big move a flurry of
[22:53] activity
[22:54] going higher
[22:56] during the week
[22:57] or going lower during the week
[23:00] and by itself
[23:03] that is huge in terms of what you're
[23:05] trying to pick now you might be wrong
[23:07] because sometimes i get it wrong
[23:09] but i'm looking for some volatility in a
[23:12] direction based on what i'm studying on
[23:14] a weekly chart so this is a daily chart
[23:16] shown on this slide here
[23:20] the same thing i would be doing to
[23:21] determine where the daily charts going
[23:23] i'm trying to do that with a weekly
[23:24] chart but i'm only interested in seeing
[23:27] what's it likely to reach for
[23:29] i'm not trying to predict the weekly
[23:31] closing price on that candlestick
[23:33] i'm trying to look for where is the bulk
[23:36] of that volatility going to be pushing
[23:38] higher or lower and why would it be like
[23:40] that
[23:41] and it's as simple as what i mentioned
[23:43] earlier is it aiming for and gravitating
[23:45] towards an old high to run above it
[23:48] or is it gravitating towards an old low
[23:50] to run below it or is there an imbalance
[23:52] where it needs to come back and revisit
[23:54] that because it might just drop down to
[23:56] a fair value gap to go higher longer
[23:58] term
[23:59] i don't even need to know that all i
[24:01] need to know is what direction is it
[24:03] most likely to have the majority of the
[24:05] volume pushing through
[24:08] now when i say volume
[24:10] there is no centralized volume number in
[24:12] 4x
[24:14] when i say the volume that means the
[24:18] the interest the
[24:21] the chaos the energy all the activity
[24:24] the action okay is it gonna be on the
[24:26] higher side reaching for buy side or is
[24:29] it gonna be on the lower side reaching
[24:30] for sell side that's what i'm looking
[24:32] for i want to find where is it likely to
[24:35] gun for
[24:36] this particular week who's in the
[24:38] crosshairs
[24:39] have people been making money going long
[24:41] is there a low they're gonna try to run
[24:43] down and stop them out with it
[24:45] that would be enough for me to frame an
[24:47] expansion going lower so i'm looking for
[24:51] obvious liquidity in that direction
[24:54] below old lows above old highs
[24:56] or
[24:58] identifying imbalances and price
[24:59] delivery top down that means from the
[25:01] weekly
[25:03] down to the daily
[25:04] down to the four hour down to the one
[25:06] hour to the 15 minute chart and then
[25:09] once we get to the five minute chart you
[25:10] do the scalings from five four three two
[25:12] and one whichever has the clear obvious
[25:14] fair value gap for you
[25:16] based on the model's
[25:18] rules
[25:20] and i focus on
[25:22] days
[25:23] that have high or medium impact calendar
[25:25] events
[25:27] only
[25:28] so
[25:30] if you go through your economic calendar
[25:32] in fact you can look at
[25:34] next month's
[25:35] economic counter they're already there
[25:38] where are
[25:39] the high impact or medium impact news
[25:41] events for the markets that you trade
[25:44] what day of the week and what time
[25:49] so if you have a news driver
[25:51] that's coming out on a particular day
[25:53] say tuesday or wednesday
[25:57] and you're expecting the weekly range to
[25:58] expand lower
[26:00] well on those medium impact or high
[26:02] impact news events
[26:03] i'm going to see hopefully something
[26:05] that is going to run up higher go into a
[26:08] fair value gap or run above a short term
[26:10] high run stops then break down show
[26:12] displacement
[26:13] then create a fair value gap and i can
[26:15] go in short on that
[26:18] and i'm doing that
[26:20] and looking for that setup
[26:22] and that directional price run inside my
[26:24] kill zones intraday
[26:26] at the same time the economic calendar
[26:29] is suggesting a high impact or medium
[26:30] impact news event is likely
[26:32] so what did i just teach you here i
[26:34] basically said that there is absolutely
[26:37] no expectation on my part to know the
[26:40] bias every single day of every single
[26:42] calendar trading day
[26:45] i'm only
[26:46] focusing on
[26:48] these
[26:49] sweet spots these low hanging fruit days
[26:52] where everything's coming to get all the
[26:53] stars are lining okay i'm looking for
[26:58] the higher time frame weekly to expand
[27:00] in a specific direction that starts my
[27:01] bias
[27:03] then
[27:03] if i think it's going to be going higher
[27:05] going lower for a specific target or
[27:07] imbalance
[27:10] then i'm going to go to the economic
[27:11] calendar to look for when that might
[27:13] occur now there may be a move that
[27:15] happens
[27:16] prior to the economic calendar event
[27:18] occurring and that's just going to be a
[27:19] missed opportunity so you have to use
[27:21] something else some other pair something
[27:23] else that you got the trade with
[27:26] sometimes that occurs
[27:30] but you'll see that there's a lot of
[27:32] opportunities using this criteria
[27:35] and it's very forgiving for you as a
[27:37] developing student because
[27:39] it's already given you permission not to
[27:41] know the daily bias outside of these
[27:44] rules
[27:46] so you want to trade every single day
[27:48] because you want to be
[27:50] the everyday trader
[27:52] i don't want to be the everyday trader
[27:54] the everyday trader
[27:57] is more prone to have losing trades
[28:00] because they are trying to do something
[28:03] every single day when there are times
[28:05] when you should not be trading at all
[28:07] and that's what makes me different from
[28:09] all the other educators out there
[28:11] because i have made a career out of
[28:13] knowing how not to destroy myself
[28:17] because that's what i did when i was a
[28:18] 20 year old
[28:20] i thought that i could trade every
[28:21] single day
[28:22] and that's
[28:24] problematic when you don't know how to
[28:25] trade and you have a lot of time or
[28:30] lack of self-control
[28:32] and that's why i was blowing accounts
[28:34] when i was 20 and 21 and 22.
[28:36] that
[28:38] fevered
[28:39] pace of i got to do it i got to do it i
[28:41] want to miss that next move
[28:43] when hopefully you've seen now enough
[28:45] instances where this pattern repeats a
[28:48] lot over the course of a month it's in
[28:51] most markets a few times a week
[28:54] but if you notice those moves are
[28:56] occurring when there's a high impact or
[28:57] media impact news driver on the econo
[28:59] calendar
[29:00] so it's something that you can plan for
[29:02] you ever hear them the old cliche
[29:04] remarks of
[29:07] books and educators they say
[29:10] plan your trade and trade your plan
[29:13] well this is how you can do that with
[29:15] that model
[29:17] you look for the economic calendar
[29:19] the time of day what kill zone in the
[29:21] market you're expecting an
[29:23] expansion high or low on that weekly
[29:25] chart
[29:28] there it is
[29:29] you're looking for these things to
[29:31] repeat
[29:32] and if you start journaling these things
[29:36] you're going to notice that the setups
[29:37] this is one of the epiphanies
[29:39] okay because i know some of you just
[29:41] don't want to do this but now because
[29:43] i'm going to tell you you're going to go
[29:44] into it hopefully and see that what i'm
[29:45] saying is true
[29:47] if you
[29:48] backlog
[29:50] every day
[29:52] show everything that took place mark up
[29:54] your charts as i'm going to show you in
[29:55] some examples in here
[29:57] when that happens over time you're going
[29:59] to see that the best setups occur when
[30:01] these calendar events are in play
[30:04] and they originate around that same time
[30:08] and what will happen is it'll convince
[30:09] you to say okay i don't need to be the
[30:11] everyday trader i don't need to be in
[30:13] here being super scalper i don't need to
[30:15] be in here trying to be an olympic
[30:18] trader
[30:19] because
[30:19] trading is not an olympic sport it's not
[30:22] an olympic event
[30:24] and they don't give out gold medals for
[30:26] over trading
[30:27] but they do
[30:29] blow accounts
[30:31] so
[30:32] eventually doing that enough
[30:34] and if you don't know what you're doing
[30:36] you're going to blow your account and
[30:37] that's hopefully what i'm trying to
[30:39] prevent you from enduring
[30:44] all right so
[30:45] we're looking at the
[30:48] hourly chart here on the s p obviously
[30:50] we've traded down
[30:53] we left relative equal lows but this low
[30:55] went just a little bit lower than that
[30:56] one that's all we need it hits that and
[30:59] it started
[31:00] retracing higher
[31:02] this movement here
[31:05] that's whip sawing both sides of the
[31:07] marketplace
[31:09] sell side taken and then buy side taken
[31:12] and then it broke down
[31:14] whenever i see price action like this i
[31:16] ignore the both side type movement
[31:19] usually it's fomc or
[31:21] some kind of rate announcement type
[31:23] event and
[31:24] that's what you're seeing here
[31:26] when i see that i ignore that wick and i
[31:28] ignore all these as well the real range
[31:30] is here this is manipulation it's
[31:32] already done it's not going to hurt you
[31:35] focus on this swing here
[31:37] so when the market drops down it creates
[31:39] this low runs a little bit lower we're
[31:41] consolidating
[31:43] we had a holiday on monday
[31:45] the market starts to drift higher
[31:48] and what i'm concerning with
[31:51] this run here is
[31:52] this high
[31:54] to that low and i'm getting my range
[31:57] equilibrium is here
[31:59] so if it's going higher
[32:01] what's it reaching for well it's going
[32:03] to go into a premium
[32:05] and then
[32:06] this right here
[32:07] this imbalance i'm not really interested
[32:09] in that one because
[32:10] it's overlapping with that equilibrium
[32:13] 50 level
[32:14] of the high
[32:15] to that low so i want to see it dig into
[32:17] a premium so even if this is going to go
[32:20] up to go down
[32:21] i want to know do i have an opportunity
[32:23] to see it go up into this area here or
[32:26] maybe even up here
[32:28] so we'll use the first low-hanging fruit
[32:30] approach here
[32:31] so we have fair value gap there in
[32:33] balance sell side only the market's
[32:35] going to want to revisit that area
[32:37] this is exactly what i teach you this is
[32:40] exactly what happened look at the bodies
[32:41] of the candles yes there's a little bit
[32:42] of
[32:44] movement just above
[32:46] this candle's low but look at the bulk
[32:48] of these candles
[32:50] the bodies
[32:52] they're staying within that range that's
[32:54] defined by what i teach you as a fair
[32:55] value gap
[32:56] in a premium market what makes it a
[32:58] premium it's above the 50 level so it's
[33:01] gone up
[33:03] into that level here it's consolidating
[33:09] on the 15-minute time frame
[33:11] pause the video look for what you can
[33:13] identify based on your understanding and
[33:15] experience learning under me so far
[33:22] okay if you need more time pause the
[33:23] video
[33:28] all right so here's midnight new york
[33:29] local time
[33:31] we had a fair value gap here
[33:33] pull a shoulder block these last three
[33:35] down closed candles that's one
[33:36] consecutive order block
[33:39] it digs into the order block with the
[33:40] fair value gap
[33:42] hits that during the london session
[33:46] it rallies up
[33:47] we create a fair value gap here
[33:49] it runs by side here and then creates
[33:51] relative equal highs
[33:53] ahead of the new york session
[33:56] so the market drops down
[33:59] goes into the fair value gap here
[34:02] into the last down closed candle bull
[34:04] shoulder block there that's where you
[34:06] could be a buyer
[34:08] ahead of
[34:09] the 9 30 opening
[34:11] why would you feel confident to do that
[34:14] because we already have an energetic
[34:15] price run from
[34:17] london open
[34:18] the market started at midnight and went
[34:20] where did it go up no
[34:23] it went
[34:24] down
[34:26] into an imbalance and then there was a
[34:28] lot of energy off of that
[34:30] so the market created
[34:32] a short-term
[34:34] shift in market structure
[34:36] here
[34:37] that's bullish
[34:39] london creates the higher the load most
[34:41] of the time 70 of time you're going to
[34:43] find that that is true
[34:45] if your directional bias is correct so
[34:48] i'm trusting that that low
[34:50] is
[34:51] probably pricing in the daily low this
[34:54] retracement into
[34:55] the new york session
[34:57] we're trading into
[34:59] an order block
[35:01] we close up this fair value gap
[35:03] then we rally a little bit and drop back
[35:06] down into the fair bay gap once more
[35:08] creating optimal trade entry that's not
[35:09] what we're going to focus on this one
[35:10] here
[35:11] but we have the new york am session
[35:13] beginning here
[35:14] from 8 30 in the morning
[35:16] to 11 this is specific
[35:19] to index futures for the morning session
[35:23] this is the upper level in that fair
[35:24] value gap
[35:25] on the hourly chart and this is the
[35:28] lower level on the hourly fair value gap
[35:32] so that's your targets it's going to be
[35:33] a draw on liquidity
[35:35] the market runs from the fairway gap
[35:37] here
[35:38] to the low of the fair value gap on the
[35:40] hourly chart to the high the fair value
[35:42] gap on the hourly chart after clearing
[35:44] buys liquidity
[35:48] on a 5-minute chart
[35:50] there's a lot of things going on here
[35:52] you can see we have a low then we ran
[35:54] that low once more then
[35:57] it rallies and moves up
[36:00] away from the order block and then back
[36:02] down into the last down closed candle on
[36:05] the five-minute chart so there's an
[36:06] hierarchy of how the market's trading
[36:08] down into a higher time frame to a lower
[36:10] time frame to a lower time frame all
[36:13] being supported by down closed candles
[36:15] within the bias that's bullish
[36:17] and once fair value gaps are being
[36:18] closed in
[36:21] the market goes higher so it's signaling
[36:23] to you it's indicating to you that you
[36:26] don't need an indicator you don't need
[36:27] some wonky little gimmicky candlestick
[36:30] replacement okay
[36:32] the candlestick is telling you
[36:33] everything you need to know
[36:34] you don't need to have any kind of
[36:35] indicators no moving averages none of
[36:37] that garbage
[36:38] okay
[36:40] everything is being shown here in price
[36:42] action relative to time
[36:45] and price
[36:47] so we have
[36:48] the market
[36:50] starting
[36:51] with a run from this low with a lower
[36:54] low
[36:54] so what took place here
[36:57] we'll come back to that in a minute
[36:59] mark comes back down into a short-term
[37:00] discount
[37:02] relative to the low to high here
[37:05] discount
[37:06] rallies and at 9 30 it's consolidating
[37:10] and then it starts to run
[37:14] reaches for the bicep liquidity here
[37:17] the low of the fair bay gap on the
[37:19] hourly chart and the high the fair value
[37:21] gap on the hourly chart as it draws on
[37:23] liquidity
[37:25] three targets all hit
[37:28] i'm going to zoom in
[37:30] and this is a
[37:32] zoomed in chart of
[37:34] the session that starts at 8 30
[37:37] and going into the 9 30 opening so we
[37:40] have the low here lower low into the
[37:42] order block
[37:44] it rallies short term shift in market
[37:46] structure here
[37:48] comes back down in there's an imbalance
[37:50] or if every gap here these levels are
[37:52] based on the five-minute chart so
[37:54] even though we're looking at a
[37:56] smaller time frame than that
[37:58] that's what we're looking at but we're
[38:00] going to refine that
[38:02] down into
[38:03] this particular time frame so inside
[38:05] that let me go back up one more slide
[38:08] so inside the fair value gap we're
[38:09] dropping down in here but we're doing it
[38:11] into this very value gap there
[38:13] down close candle that's an order block
[38:15] and fair value gap
[38:18] there it is
[38:20] you can buy this
[38:22] right there
[38:23] and trust that it's not likely to take
[38:25] that low out why
[38:28] because we already had a stop running
[38:29] event here
[38:32] low
[38:33] lower low sell side taken reaction
[38:37] off the order block
[38:38] we're into the fair value gap we rallied
[38:40] once more we created a fair value gap
[38:42] here drop down that last down closed
[38:44] candle you can be a buyer there
[38:47] there's buy side liquidity resting up
[38:49] here that's going to be your initial
[38:50] draw on liquidity so that'd be a first
[38:51] partial
[38:53] if you want to add if you want to
[38:55] pyramid
[38:56] the position
[38:59] you can add that as it starts to run up
[39:00] higher
[39:02] but i want to show you the low to the
[39:04] high here that's 50 or equilibrium the
[39:07] market drops into a discount prior to
[39:09] that
[39:11] run up here
[39:12] this consolidation at 9 30 we see it
[39:15] taking off here
[39:17] it's already done the move of
[39:19] manipulation knocking people out
[39:22] retracing
[39:25] then off to the races
[39:26] so
[39:27] this is a case where you do not need to
[39:29] wait for nine thirties opening to get
[39:31] that volatility to get these type of
[39:34] manipulation moves
[39:35] this is an early setup
[39:38] discount
[39:41] fair value gap
[39:43] and rallies so notice what's happening
[39:45] we have an hourly discount that we're
[39:47] trading into here
[39:49] then it creates a
[39:51] short-term
[39:53] discount relative to this low to this
[39:55] high that's we're seeing here then the
[39:58] market rallies
[40:00] here
[40:01] comes back down into an order block
[40:04] and fair value gap discount
[40:06] rallies
[40:07] consolidates ahead of 9 30. is it likely
[40:10] to trade back down and take that low out
[40:12] no
[40:13] because it's already closed in the only
[40:15] fair value gap that's here
[40:17] see that so if you're up here
[40:19] looking back it's already rebalanced
[40:21] this there's no reason for it to go down
[40:23] it doesn't need to go down here
[40:24] because it's already shown a willingness
[40:26] to want to rally and this run didn't
[40:28] need to go over here because this low
[40:30] took out that low so that is all
[40:31] framework in narrative
[40:35] so all of that comes together
[40:37] now also couple that with
[40:40] the 830 news
[40:42] that took place in the dollar cad
[40:45] i'm showing you how these two markets
[40:47] relate to one another with the proper
[40:49] context
[40:50] and bias
[40:53] dollar cad what is the currency's first
[40:55] pair
[40:57] in its name dollar
[40:59] so if we're expecting as i was hinting
[41:01] it on twitter
[41:03] it going down to a discount or running
[41:04] sell side liquidity that means the bias
[41:06] is bearish
[41:07] so if the bias is bearish on dollar cad
[41:11] that means that
[41:14] it's a risk-on scenario
[41:16] so the markets like
[41:19] s p nasdaq
[41:21] other foreign currencies are going to
[41:23] be easier to rally
[41:26] versus going down
[41:28] in dollar pairs
[41:30] i'm not really interested in anything
[41:31] except for the dollar cad because dollar
[41:33] cad had the high impact news event
[41:35] so i don't need to go to the dollar
[41:38] itself
[41:40] when i have a high impact news event or
[41:42] one dollar cad i can go right to that
[41:44] and cut to the chase and determine what
[41:46] the bias is for the morning session
[41:48] because if i'm likely to see lower
[41:49] prices on dollar cad that's the same
[41:52] thing as saying
[41:53] lower dollar
[41:54] higher foreign currency and when the
[41:56] dollar goes down it's easy for spoos or
[41:59] e-mini s p stock index features to go
[42:01] higher
[42:02] and everything i've shown here is in
[42:05] concert with that idea
[42:08] so here we have that
[42:11] short-term high shift in market
[42:13] structure
[42:14] after the stop hunt retracement to a
[42:17] discount the fair value got buying here
[42:19] run to initial target buys liquidity
[42:22] relative equal highs here it runs that
[42:24] you can't see it here remember we're
[42:26] dropping down this is a three minute
[42:27] chart now
[42:29] it rallies up creates a fair value gap
[42:30] here overshoots it a little bit that's
[42:32] fine
[42:33] rallies once more
[42:34] and digs into the high of the hourly
[42:37] fair value gap
[42:41] and again kind of like what i was
[42:43] suggesting moments ago
[42:45] here is that movement up in
[42:48] the s p
[42:49] at the 9 30 time period
[42:51] when the dollar cad was trading down
[42:54] into its discount
[42:56] here so lower dollar cad
[43:00] higher s p
[43:01] so
[43:02] as a
[43:03] forex trader you could be selling short
[43:06] if you're not an s p trader
[43:08] or if you're not trading forex like me
[43:11] this
[43:12] is the long one s p
[43:14] and you can add in as it's taking out
[43:16] this short term high here
[43:18] you can look for
[43:20] pyramiding opportunities and what would
[43:22] that look like
[43:23] well i was in a 10 second chart i know
[43:26] some of you were surprised when i said
[43:28] that
[43:29] but here is the 9 30 opening
[43:31] here
[43:32] and we had a little bit of consolidation
[43:33] then we had a run higher
[43:36] creating the fair value gap between here
[43:37] and here the market dropped down i'm
[43:39] buying there
[43:41] it rallies up into that there's my entry
[43:43] you can see it right there that's the
[43:44] fill that's the price 37 41 and three
[43:47] quarters
[43:48] and as the market goes higher if you're
[43:50] trading like this you can take first
[43:52] partials at logical levels as i
[43:53] mentioned we were on the higher time
[43:55] frame charts and as it goes higher you
[43:57] just scale off what
[43:59] your model what your approach or your
[44:01] plan would allow for and then hold
[44:03] something for the rest of the day
[44:04] towards the close or at least try to see
[44:06] if you get a continuation into the
[44:08] afternoon session and that would be
[44:09] between 1 30
[44:11] and 4 o'clock in the afternoon new york
[44:13] local time
[44:14] so hopefully this has been insightful to
[44:16] you hopefully it has helped you
[44:18] obviously in terms of using other
[44:20] markets for inter-market relationships
[44:22] for bias how to navigate markets these
[44:25] are the only two markets i talked about
[44:27] today and you can see how they had a
[44:30] synergy between them there was a
[44:34] a movement and kind of like a dance
[44:36] between them even though they're not
[44:37] correlated don't think that there's any
[44:38] kind of correlation between them it's
[44:41] the fact that it's risk on risk off
[44:42] that's all that it is and i was focusing
[44:44] primarily on dollar cad because dollar
[44:46] cad had its high impact news drivers for
[44:48] today
[44:49] so i was using that
[44:51] in relationship to what i would expect
[44:53] in the s p market and i found my trade
[44:56] by utilizing a market i'm not going to
[44:58] trade but if it's going to give me
[44:59] insights and it's going to go lower
[45:01] it helps me frame risk on risk off risk
[45:04] on that means
[45:06] foreign currencies index futures stocks
[45:09] go higher dollar goes down
[45:12] risk off is dollar higher and everything
[45:14] else going down
[45:15] so if you go into your day with those
[45:17] ideas
[45:18] risk on risk off it makes it a lot
[45:20] easier to look for supporting ideas with
[45:22] intermarket relationships
[45:24] correlations between
[45:26] assets like if you are trading like
[45:28] forex
[45:29] euro dollar versus cable uh euro dollar
[45:32] would be a better trade than
[45:35] say
[45:35] pound dollar if there is an inability
[45:38] for one of them to go
[45:41] low make a lower low
[45:43] and one doesn't do that that's showing
[45:45] you that's the relative strength leader
[45:47] that would be the better buy in this
[45:48] situation here another instance would be
[45:51] aussie dollar and
[45:52] kiwi dollar
[45:54] in new zealand dollar
[45:55] if you're looking at situations like
[45:57] this and you find a currency that fails
[46:00] to make a lower low
[46:01] intraday
[46:03] when it's risk on
[46:05] you would be buying the risk on
[46:07] higher low
[46:08] currency and i don't i didn't see i
[46:10] didn't look at
[46:12] the australian dollar and the kiwi this
[46:13] morning and it may not have presented it
[46:15] but
[46:16] if i were trading those pairs and i
[46:18] wouldn't really be trading them because
[46:19] the impact news driver on the account
[46:21] calendar is again on dollar cad so
[46:24] that's the market i would be trading so
[46:26] a lot of you ask all the time like how
[46:27] do you know which pair to trade how do
[46:29] you know which one to pick i'm starting
[46:31] that with the economic calendar
[46:34] but sometimes
[46:35] i may use
[46:37] that market
[46:38] for instance instead of being dollar cad
[46:40] today if euro dollar had a high impact
[46:43] news event i would compare pound dollar
[46:46] and euro dollar for correlation
[46:49] so i would look for smt diversions
[46:52] to signal which one i'd rather be in
[46:54] just because the news driver
[46:56] is in for instance
[46:58] the euro
[46:59] the better trade may be in pound dollar
[47:02] if they both went down prior to the news
[47:04] event coming out for euro
[47:06] and if pound dollar failed to make a
[47:07] lower low i'm buying pound dollar
[47:10] because they're going to most likely
[47:11] move in sympathy with one another
[47:13] because they're closely correlated
[47:16] but
[47:17] in the instance of dollar cad
[47:20] i'm not going to do anything except for
[47:22] focus on dollar cad because the economic
[47:24] calendar suggested that's where the
[47:25] volatility would be for forex today and
[47:28] you're welcome to go through the pairs
[47:30] and compare and contrast whether that's
[47:32] true or not i didn't do it but you can
[47:33] do that on your own
[47:35] and hopefully you got something out of
[47:37] this one until i talk to you on thursday
[47:40] for our
[47:41] discussion on money management that'll
[47:42] complete the
[47:44] 2022 mentorship
[47:46] teachings and we'll just continuously do
[47:49] market reviews on the youtube channel
[47:52] monday through friday so i'll obviously
[47:54] be back lord willing tomorrow on
[47:56] wednesday with a review on something
[47:58] either s p related or some kind of 4x
[48:00] pair
[48:01] and hopefully you'll learn something
[48:02] from that as well until next time be
[48:04] safe
