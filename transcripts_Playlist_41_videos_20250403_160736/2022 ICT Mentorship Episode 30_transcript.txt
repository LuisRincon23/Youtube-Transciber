[00:00] all right folks welcome back
[00:02] so today we had the chairman speaking at
[00:05] two o'clock in the afternoon
[00:07] you can see that here now I'm gonna
[00:10] kind of work backward today
[00:13] and I'm gonna talk about the one minute
[00:15] chart work our way back out to a higher
[00:17] time frame
[00:18] so it's kind of like a bottom-up
[00:21] analysis
[00:23] so uh
[00:25] ahead of the two o'clock in the
[00:26] afternoon
[00:28] fed chairman
[00:30] jawboning session uh we've seen this
[00:33] little Judas Point here and notice that
[00:36] it just fell short
[00:38] um the morning High and the high comes
[00:40] here at 12 5 35 and a half
[00:45] and over here in the morning session
[00:53] 12535 and three quarters so it felt one
[00:57] quarter of a point or one tick
[01:01] short of that high
[01:03] so it runs up after clearing relative
[01:05] equal highs then breaks lower no model
[01:10] short in here
[01:12] then the market drops once more below
[01:14] relative equal lows
[01:16] now what are these lows here
[01:20] these are the lows in lunch hour New
[01:23] York lunch okay here's noon to one and I
[01:26] taught you in the mentorship that many
[01:28] times when there's an afternoon
[01:29] continuation to the upside
[01:31] you'll see that the lows at lunch time
[01:33] will get swept and we're seeing that
[01:36] here now it dug down deeper into an area
[01:40] which I did a recording for Twitter
[01:43] today and
[01:45] my chart didn't have this I thought I
[01:47] had it because I was looking at another
[01:48] monitors but
[01:50] this is the imbalance that I was looking
[01:52] at that unfortunately doesn't appear in
[01:54] there but it's there obviously and it's
[01:57] below the relative equal lows and the
[01:59] market drops down below that and then
[02:01] all of this right here was manipulation
[02:03] and there's lots of manipulation
[02:05] initially the market rallies up
[02:08] and what I was outlining here is the
[02:11] time of the recording I had this
[02:12] actually misspelled had it racked they
[02:15] should be rigged as it should I think
[02:18] that's the right spelling I'm even
[02:19] questioning it again now but uh
[02:21] basically what's implying here is that
[02:22] long holders were raked across the coals
[02:24] not permitted to profit on the 12 553 in
[02:28] a quarter run so it starts off like it's
[02:31] going to go up to that level we were
[02:32] looking for and fall short of it and
[02:35] breaks down so what's actually happening
[02:37] is is buy stops are being triggered so
[02:40] anyone that wants to go long on like
[02:42] bull flag patterns and things like that
[02:43] or breakout Traders they're buying and
[02:46] then they're getting taken against their
[02:50] long withdraw down until they either
[02:52] stopped out or if they don't have
[02:54] stop-offs they get squeezed out so they
[02:55] can't take it anymore they just bail out
[02:57] below the relative equal lows any long
[03:00] holders from the morning they have
[03:02] trailed their stop loss below here so
[03:04] they take them out why because they
[03:06] don't want them being able to profit to
[03:08] the real move what was the real move I
[03:09] hinted at twelve thousand five five
[03:10] three and a quarter that was a draw in
[03:12] liquidity so we took out the New York
[03:14] lunch lows here and what I was
[03:17] suggesting here is shorts are about to
[03:19] be squeezed as it rips higher into
[03:21] twelve thousand five hundred oh that
[03:24] should be five five three sorry that's a
[03:26] misprint there you all know what that is
[03:28] because it's right here but
[03:30] I was being facetious when I was
[03:32] recording because as I was watching I
[03:33] was watching it run out
[03:35] then it broke down I was like okay
[03:36] they're gonna take the liquidity out
[03:38] below here and dig into this imbalance
[03:40] pick up some more orders I got one off
[03:44] as far as a long and a really poor entry
[03:47] but I was really focused on just being
[03:49] below
[03:51] these relative equal those I was fine
[03:52] and my stop was here because you'll see
[03:55] in the
[03:57] on my Twitter feed and you can find me
[04:01] on Twitter at
[04:02] the at symbol capital I underscore
[04:06] a m
[04:08] underscore v t h e underscore ICT in
[04:12] other words so anyway that little
[04:14] recording
[04:15] shows me getting in here and it's below
[04:17] the lows and I was out by how this is
[04:20] not a
[04:23] your favorite got to go short at and
[04:25] it's resistance don't look it like that
[04:27] it went up a little bit made a little
[04:29] notation and annotation rather that this
[04:32] was not resistance it's going to lift
[04:33] off from here and it went down to an
[04:35] order block started rallying and I was
[04:39] basically outlining the internal
[04:41] dialogue of those individuals that may
[04:43] be short from like twelve thousand five
[04:44] thirty and their stock also be right
[04:46] here and I was kind of like saying
[04:50] what would you feel if you were short
[04:52] from up here would you feel safe
[04:53] certainly you would feel safe but I said
[04:55] watch how that changes and then all of a
[04:57] sudden it starts running up
[04:59] and then
[05:00] in here we have order block it trades
[05:03] into that multiple times
[05:05] to realize that fair value Gap I
[05:07] outlined that it didn't get into it but
[05:08] I was allowing for that type of movement
[05:11] and then at three o'clock the algorithms
[05:14] will start to spool price in the
[05:15] direction for the liquidity which was
[05:17] that twelve thousand five five three and
[05:19] a quarter level which it hammers
[05:22] there and I'll put the business up right
[05:26] here
[05:27] and you'll see
[05:30] what you should be seeing
[05:33] what I told you my eyes are not that
[05:35] good oh here it is
[05:37] you saw about two twelve thousand four
[05:40] Seventeen and three quarters so just
[05:42] below this 20 Level here
[05:45] mainly focusing on this because I missed
[05:48] the opportunity getting in during this
[05:50] little imbalance there so that fair back
[05:53] out I wanted to be in it there but
[05:55] unfortunately I didn't get the position
[05:56] on in time and it was over here on this
[05:59] candle so I wasn't quick enough on the
[06:01] draw so the market trades back down into
[06:04] the order block and look at how it
[06:07] delivers with that fear of Vega look at
[06:10] that
[06:11] beautiful delivery revisits there with
[06:14] the order block
[06:15] rallies up
[06:17] pause
[06:19] send it higher order block
[06:22] sends a higher
[06:24] consolidates right below the target
[06:26] we've been looking for and then they
[06:28] pump it up into
[06:30] maybe here twelve thousand five three
[06:32] and a quarter and above
[06:34] and again fulfill
[06:38] an exits and that's the business there
[06:43] um
[06:44] let's go and take
[06:46] some of this
[06:47] off we don't need to see this anymore we
[06:50] don't need to see that anymore
[06:53] we don't need this
[06:56] and don't need that
[07:02] okay and I'm gonna take you to a five
[07:06] minute chart
[07:06] [Music]
[07:11] okay now it doesn't look so obvious in
[07:14] here as to what may be available
[07:18] but
[07:19] we just bumped below that high
[07:23] early on in the morning
[07:25] then broke down and all the liquidity
[07:28] resting above here
[07:31] was treating the
[07:33] retail market like
[07:35] hey you can trust us you know this is
[07:37] resistance it's not going to go up there
[07:39] and then when it starts to sell off like
[07:41] this
[07:42] notice that my model did not give a
[07:45] setup this morning or not this morning
[07:46] but this afternoon it didn't give this
[07:47] setup in here even though it didn't run
[07:49] by side it did sell off it did not give
[07:52] a setup notice that it's important to
[07:54] notice that so some of you are fearful
[07:57] what happens if I take a trade and it's
[07:58] wrong hopefully you see that not it's
[08:01] not like this all the time but you'll
[08:03] find that when the Market's really
[08:05] in sync
[08:08] these algorithmic principles will not
[08:11] appear
[08:12] in markets that are not likely to
[08:14] deliver as I'm showing you so it's not a
[08:18] fantasy it means it's not going to work
[08:20] all the time but hopefully you can see
[08:23] that there are times when the market
[08:24] does sell off
[08:26] but it doesn't give us a setup but then
[08:28] it creates the real move the other
[08:30] direction where you can find my setups
[08:33] and the formations of the Fairway Gap
[08:34] and such so
[08:37] obviously you can see that you know the
[08:38] market did in fact trade down into the
[08:40] imbalance on that one minute chart
[08:43] and it rallies from there into the 12
[08:47] 553 level we'll take that level off now
[08:50] and I'm gonna go out to a 15 minute time
[08:52] frame
[08:54] don't want to spend too much time here
[08:57] get an imbalance in here it trades down
[09:00] into that as well on the 15 minute time
[09:02] frame optimal trade entry
[09:04] here
[09:06] and realize that for the most high
[09:07] liquidity again aiming for that twelve
[09:09] thousand five five three and a quarter
[09:11] and we'll look at the 16 inch term
[09:14] [Music]
[09:17] okay in the market trades back down into
[09:19] all this here
[09:21] and rallies up
[09:23] and
[09:24] [Music]
[09:25] this was that area I was telling you
[09:27] about a week or so ago this is what
[09:30] we're looking for I mentioned that on my
[09:32] community tab on my YouTube channel
[09:34] and we have now just pressed up into
[09:36] that area so let's go over here and do
[09:39] this
[09:43] and I think we'll use this one as the
[09:46] higher one you can see we did in fact
[09:47] clear that in that's where that 12 000
[09:49] I3 level
[09:51] and a quarter rather came from I'm not
[09:54] suggesting that we're making a high here
[09:55] to go lower
[09:57] the next area on the upside you know
[10:00] it's really sloppy over here I would
[10:02] look for this one here next
[10:04] and what is that high
[10:06] 12 6 24 even
[10:09] and if we start to really run we could
[10:11] revisit this area here but I'm not going
[10:13] so far as to say that for right now but
[10:15] just look for uh this one here that's
[10:17] that's a nice one to look for in the
[10:19] next
[10:20] upside right there I think that's a fair
[10:22] one too
[10:23] to anticipate and study and I think that
[10:27] is going to be it
[10:29] um no I'm going to show you one more
[10:30] time frames
[10:33] the daily chart
[10:37] uh can I get that to pop up
[10:41] um
[10:42] [Music]
[10:46] foreign
[10:50] relative equal highs and here we ran up
[10:53] into that so that's that whole business
[10:55] based on the daily chart as I was
[10:57] talking about in
[10:58] I don't know what episode was recently
[11:00] in the mentorship on YouTube so
[11:02] hopefully you guys can see that that is
[11:04] in fact what we were working with for
[11:06] daily bias uh yes you know the market
[11:09] did in fact create you know a big run
[11:13] lower
[11:15] and then create another run lower here
[11:18] but that wasn't my setup
[11:20] I was drawing everyone's attention up to
[11:22] that twelve thousand five by three level
[11:23] and this was the run that I liked and
[11:26] this is the one that was the hunt Okay
[11:28] and
[11:29] here's that little one here and there so
[11:31] anyway
[11:33] not a whole lot of uh
[11:37] money through that paper trade there's
[11:40] like a little over five thousand dollars
[11:42] in terms of hypothetical profit but hey
[11:46] it worked you know you guys can see that
[11:48] the effects of it and it's a little bit
[11:50] of an advanced idea but I did teach
[11:52] about the general
[11:54] factors that go behind PM or afternoon
[11:57] session trading if you're publish and it
[12:00] consolidates in lunch find the lunch
[12:02] lows wait for it to run that out and
[12:05] then they'll resume and it's right out
[12:06] of the teachings in this mentorship on
[12:08] this YouTube channel so hopefully you
[12:09] found this one insightful and I'll touch
[12:11] base with you again on Thursday Lord
[12:13] will
