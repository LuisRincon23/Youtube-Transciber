[00:07] all right folks welcome back
[00:09] this is our
[00:11] 25th episode
[00:13] of the free youtube
[00:14] ict mentorship for 2022
[00:18] and i want to open this video up with a
[00:20] very
[00:21] brief
[00:23] monologue okay all right some of you are
[00:26] trying to scrub the video get past this
[00:27] part
[00:28] but bear with me just for a few moments
[00:30] please
[00:32] i want you to think about
[00:35] how i opened this mentorship up
[00:37] how i promised certain things
[00:41] i said you would learn
[00:42] specific logic that would repeat
[00:45] that it would be
[00:46] algorithmic
[00:48] it would look
[00:49] similar each time it does it
[00:51] there would be specific rules implied
[00:53] that you would have to follow
[00:56] and i taught on the basis of time
[00:59] and price
[01:00] so there's going to be things that
[01:02] obviously repeat with those themes
[01:05] but i want you to go into tonight's
[01:06] lesson
[01:07] with those promises in the forefront of
[01:10] your mind
[01:12] is what i'm teaching
[01:14] and has
[01:16] what i've been teaching
[01:19] exactly what i promised
[01:22] are you seeing it in the chart yourself
[01:25] now i'm not asking
[01:27] for a show of hands how many of you are
[01:29] profitable trading
[01:31] with live funds that's not what i'm
[01:33] saying here
[01:34] none of you should be trading with life
[01:36] funds with this you're all still
[01:37] learning it
[01:39] i'm reading some of the comments and
[01:41] some people are raising their hand up
[01:43] saying i just killed it today using what
[01:45] you thought made this much money blah
[01:47] blah blah
[01:50] i don't want you doing that
[01:52] okay because what you're doing is you're
[01:53] rushing in
[01:55] because you have a sugar rush you have a
[01:56] high right now
[01:58] because you're seeing things that make
[01:59] sense to you it resonates with you and
[02:01] that's great
[02:02] but don't be in a hurry to get out there
[02:04] and try to make money yet
[02:06] there's things like you'll see tonight
[02:08] that will help you still when you think
[02:11] you've already learned it you haven't
[02:14] and this is for the folks that are
[02:15] commenting in my videos
[02:17] saying that there are other people
[02:18] that'll teach what i'm teaching better
[02:21] and to the point
[02:22] nobody knows what i'm teaching i'm
[02:25] teaching this for the first time
[02:27] okay and you don't know the details
[02:29] behind what it is i'm teaching you don't
[02:31] know how far i'm going to take it and
[02:33] most of these guys don't even really
[02:34] trade
[02:35] so they sound like
[02:37] smart
[02:38] geniuses after the fact
[02:40] with market replay or old data
[02:43] and they have my vocabulary
[02:46] what i do is i call it before it happens
[02:48] i outline it why it should happen
[02:50] because that's proof of understanding
[02:52] the logic that that's understanding the
[02:54] algorithm
[02:55] i'm not implementing like i'm not
[02:57] putting anything in here with supply and
[02:58] demand and mr chris laurie can come here
[03:01] and tell me if i'm teaching or trading
[03:03] anything like him because i promise you
[03:05] none of this is found in his stuff
[03:07] period okay
[03:08] so
[03:10] when you see folks say
[03:12] this person teaches ict better than ict
[03:16] or more to the point really what they're
[03:18] saying is
[03:19] they
[03:20] truncate
[03:22] the concepts down to
[03:25] demonstrating hindsight
[03:28] so that way it makes them
[03:30] able to sell courses to the neophytes
[03:33] notice i'm not selling you anything
[03:36] i have already made millions of dollars
[03:38] i don't need to hold my hand out and ask
[03:40] you to pay my bills
[03:43] i do this because i love doing it i
[03:45] don't have a paypal
[03:47] i don't have a credit card swiper i
[03:49] don't have
[03:50] a cash app i don't do any of those
[03:53] things i do this because i love doing it
[03:56] and i am absolutely loving
[03:59] hannah fx or hannah 4x
[04:01] youtube channel because number one it's
[04:03] given me the female
[04:05] perspective
[04:07] and someone i think that is really
[04:09] trying to make a a go of it
[04:11] and i'm not
[04:13] concerned whether she really sticks with
[04:15] it long term and she may come to the
[04:16] conclusion that this is not worth it for
[04:18] her or
[04:19] it doesn't really jive
[04:22] it doesn't matter i'm interested in her
[04:24] development
[04:25] i'm interested in all of your
[04:26] developments
[04:28] obviously i can't follow every single
[04:30] person that follows me on youtube and
[04:33] some of you may be feeling slighted like
[04:35] why'd you pick her and not my channel
[04:38] please don't look at it that way
[04:40] understand it from a father's
[04:41] perspective because
[04:43] i look at all of you like my children
[04:45] even those that are older than me
[04:47] i try to teach you with the mindset that
[04:49] someone that has been through this
[04:51] longer than most of you if not all of
[04:53] you
[04:54] and i don't want to see you get hurt
[04:56] but i also have a daughter that i'm
[04:58] trying to inspire to do this on her own
[05:01] because i don't want her relying on
[05:03] another man
[05:04] to feed her to take care of her
[05:07] and i also want her to be able to break
[05:09] those lines of feeling comfortable
[05:11] because she's our daughter
[05:15] so i'm
[05:16] actively interested
[05:18] in
[05:19] this particular youtuber
[05:21] for the reason because i have a daughter
[05:22] that i'm trying to draw affinity with
[05:24] trading through her
[05:26] okay so
[05:28] it may not work but it's just
[05:30] me
[05:32] seeing how
[05:33] another young lady
[05:35] that is inspired to
[05:37] dig into these charts and understand
[05:39] what they're doing why they're doing
[05:40] what they're doing
[05:41] and hopefully that will inspire my
[05:43] daughter okay so
[05:44] for the folks that are emailing me and
[05:46] saying hey look can you follow me can
[05:48] you do this can you do that just
[05:49] understand that
[05:51] it's not my interest to try to you know
[05:53] sprinkle myself over everyone's channel
[05:55] because i think
[05:57] for the most part
[05:58] when i make an appearance in their
[05:59] comment section
[06:02] it's just like
[06:03] a rush of people coming in and like
[06:05] high-fiving me and
[06:07] you pray praising me in their comment
[06:10] section i don't like that i don't want
[06:12] to do that if you all would just refrain
[06:14] from doing it i'd probably comment more
[06:16] on other people's channels but i think
[06:18] it's rude okay i don't think it's
[06:20] appropriate
[06:21] and to those that i have made a
[06:24] appearance in their comment section and
[06:26] my friends and associates and students
[06:28] that have come behind and created like a
[06:30] circus environment around it
[06:33] apologize because that's not what i'm
[06:35] showing up for i'm going there because
[06:37] either i watched your video i felt that
[06:39] you gave something that was useful to
[06:41] the community or i just i just liked it
[06:44] so
[06:46] there's that
[06:47] so with all that let's get into
[06:50] the meat
[06:52] all right so we're looking at
[06:54] the e-mini s p futures june 2022
[06:58] delivery contract price action for the
[07:00] daily chart now before i get into this
[07:03] please
[07:04] write this in your journal
[07:05] okay
[07:06] put your sandwich down and turn the tv
[07:09] off
[07:10] excuse yourself from your children and
[07:12] your spouse go in another room i promise
[07:14] rowling will be here for a couple
[07:15] minutes tonight
[07:18] everything i'm teaching you here
[07:20] works in forex
[07:22] okay it works in forex it's not limited
[07:25] to index futures
[07:27] please stop asking questions in the
[07:29] comment section that are answered if you
[07:31] just simply paid attention to the videos
[07:33] i've already produced okay maybe some of
[07:35] you just recently got to this
[07:37] and you came to this video first
[07:39] don't start here go back to the very
[07:41] first one okay
[07:42] now when we're looking at the daily
[07:44] chart i want you to think about what it
[07:46] is that i talked about before happening
[07:49] explained in great detail why it should
[07:51] take place
[07:53] and when the chart looked like this
[07:55] remember i was talking about how that
[07:57] specific order block
[08:00] was a catalyst for setting up a future
[08:02] move
[08:04] that shouldn't see the high of that
[08:06] candle pierced in other words that's the
[08:08] most unlikely level
[08:11] that's being here right here okay
[08:13] price should not go to and through that
[08:15] this is the most unlikely level to be
[08:17] traded to with a bearish order block now
[08:20] for some of you like oh can you teach
[08:22] order blocks i've already taught and
[08:23] introduced order blocks for some of you
[08:25] that are asking about order blocks
[08:26] watch my sniper series okay the scout
[08:29] sniper series it's in his youtube
[08:31] channel it's free
[08:32] i introduced the order block there and
[08:34] i'm also teaching more
[08:36] throughout the other series and
[08:37] specifically in this one
[08:39] now
[08:40] that's not the whole
[08:43] of this model it's not the
[08:46] secret sauce okay the fair value gap is
[08:49] what i'm trying to teach you to focus on
[08:51] because that small little area in price
[08:53] action that is the thing
[08:55] that is the easiest if i were to be
[08:57] asked simply what is it that's the
[08:59] easiest thing for a new trader to sit
[09:01] down and understand right away
[09:04] that's what this mentorship is
[09:06] this is somebody that has never traded
[09:08] before
[09:09] that doesn't really know a whole lot
[09:10] about technical analysis
[09:13] this is my introductory version of that
[09:16] uh there's a lot of people and hannah
[09:17] mentioned this before she doesn't
[09:18] believe that my concepts are for
[09:20] like the neophyte the brand new
[09:23] i went in with that mindset with this
[09:27] teaching series now obviously i'm not
[09:28] going to teach what a pip is i'm not
[09:31] going to teach
[09:32] you know how to calculate you know
[09:35] the smallest fluctuation in price
[09:37] because those things can be googled okay
[09:40] there's a there are obvious things that
[09:41] anyone can look up
[09:43] but the basic of basic understanding the
[09:45] time axis down here on the bottom and
[09:47] the price access up here and
[09:49] understanding how to find the time
[09:50] frames like this is a daily chart you
[09:52] can see that right here
[09:55] i work through trading view you may not
[09:57] want to use trading game maybe you use
[09:58] sierra charts maybe you use
[10:01] ninjatrader maybe you use tradestation
[10:03] two
[10:04] all those things or
[10:07] td ameritrade there's all these
[10:08] different brokers out there but what i
[10:10] want you to learn through
[10:13] and practice through is trading view
[10:16] okay you don't need to have a
[10:17] subscription
[10:18] to do what i'm showing you
[10:20] you don't need to pay for anything
[10:21] you'll see ads and it's okay but the
[10:23] bottom line is is
[10:25] i want you to look at the charts like
[10:26] this then you can segue into whatever
[10:28] your platform is
[10:30] and work with it there but understand
[10:32] learning the way i'm teaching you with
[10:34] this medium is the best way of doing it
[10:37] so with that
[10:39] understand that i mentioned that we
[10:40] would go into this area here not trade
[10:42] to the top of that candle and all this
[10:44] is mentioned in this
[10:45] mentorship series go back and watch
[10:46] those videos
[10:48] and i mentioned that we would draw down
[10:49] into here
[10:51] and into here
[10:54] so underneath that low here in these
[10:57] relative equal lows that's cell side
[10:59] liquidity
[11:01] what was the framework
[11:02] that led to me telling you that this was
[11:04] a bearish order block or watching that
[11:06] and that could set up a run into our may
[11:09] seasonal tendency now seasonal
[11:11] tendencies are
[11:12] times in a year where markets or
[11:16] specific asset classes
[11:18] will move
[11:19] generally not always not a hundred
[11:20] percent of time not absolutely never
[11:23] going to fail
[11:25] they historically have produced
[11:28] price swings that follow a seasonal
[11:32] tenancy that means they usually happen
[11:35] and one of the things i like to use as a
[11:38] i guess an analogy would be
[11:41] i live on the east coast of the united
[11:42] states so if i live in the east coast of
[11:44] the united states
[11:46] and i reside in maryland okay
[11:49] would it be reasonable for me to expect
[11:51] snow on the 4th of july
[11:54] no
[11:55] what's more likely
[11:57] sunny hot
[11:58] okay so that's the seasonal influence
[12:01] well that same influence not that
[12:03] specific not that that dramatic
[12:06] obviously but there are periods in the
[12:08] year where the markets have a tendency
[12:11] to do certain things
[12:13] may tends to be a month where the market
[12:16] in index futures and stocks they
[12:18] generally drop they go down
[12:22] i gave you that beforehand i explained
[12:24] it to you now i didn't give you the
[12:25] details about it but just understand
[12:27] going in every single year
[12:29] about the last week or so of april going
[12:32] into the month of may
[12:33] there's usually a tendency for these
[12:36] markets specifically the s p the nasdaq
[12:40] the dow the russell
[12:43] that
[12:44] group of markets
[12:45] tends to be weak
[12:47] not all the time but generally if you
[12:50] study go back through old data you'll
[12:51] see that's true now
[12:53] by itself
[12:55] it doesn't really mean much
[12:57] but
[12:58] in the hands of someone that's initiated
[13:00] with what i'm teaching you
[13:02] it is a road map
[13:04] to consistency
[13:06] you can practice and learn a lot about
[13:08] price action by doing this every single
[13:11] year going through old data and then you
[13:13] can forward test it going into next year
[13:15] and all the years after
[13:17] but what took place
[13:18] was we had these relative equal highs i
[13:21] mentioned this they took the buy stops
[13:23] or buy side liquidity out
[13:25] who's doing that
[13:26] smart money
[13:28] these individuals that go in and they
[13:30] sell to these buy stops when it's like
[13:33] this and at the same time when we're
[13:34] entering a period of time where there's
[13:36] a bearish
[13:37] seasonal tendency that means
[13:39] bearish prices lower expected going into
[13:43] may
[13:44] so we're seeing a run on liquidity here
[13:48] with this high so it bumps
[13:51] above these highs and then breaks down
[13:53] then we go into an area i mentioned that
[13:55] it's very shorter block and i said we're
[13:56] gonna aim for here and then under here
[13:59] and another under here
[14:00] okay so i gave you a perspective
[14:03] beforehand so that we could study it
[14:06] each day looking for lower prices
[14:09] going in looking for the pattern i
[14:10] taught you
[14:12] in this mentorship
[14:13] around specific elements of time we had
[14:16] this big move
[14:18] from here
[14:19] down here where it attacked the cell
[14:21] stops or sell side liquidity
[14:24] what took place here
[14:25] smart money sold to the buy stops
[14:29] so now they're sitting with a net short
[14:30] position
[14:31] how do they get out of that position
[14:33] they have to buy it back
[14:35] how can they buy it back at a cheaper
[14:38] price
[14:39] guaranteeing them
[14:41] that they're going to be buying from
[14:42] lower priced sellers
[14:46] fine to sell stocks here sell side
[14:49] liquidity rest below here why are there
[14:51] sale stocks below there because traders
[14:53] have models that
[14:55] want to capture these types of moves
[14:57] and expect things like this high to be
[14:59] taken out before they start trailing
[15:01] their stop loss large fund traders
[15:04] not
[15:06] retail rick that trades on mt4
[15:09] okay that's not what i'm talking about
[15:11] but historically you're going to find
[15:13] out that retail traders are going to
[15:14] have many times their stop losses in the
[15:17] same area that large funds will the only
[15:20] difference in the only contrast between
[15:21] the two is that retail rick or people
[15:24] that are very small speculators
[15:26] the small traders liquidity is so
[15:30] minute it's tiny it's irrelevant
[15:33] but that argument is used by people that
[15:35] don't understand what they're talking
[15:36] about because they'll say
[15:37] what i'm teaching
[15:39] other quote unquote institutional
[15:41] traitors or other youtubers laugh when
[15:43] they say they look at what i'm teaching
[15:45] they say it doesn't work or it's
[15:47] nonsense or it's a fallacy
[15:49] these same people aren't going out and
[15:51] saying how it's a policy when i'm
[15:53] calling you before it happens and now
[15:54] when i say things like that that takes
[15:57] people that want to come in critically
[15:59] and say look he's bragging i'm not
[16:00] bragging i'm asking you all to come in
[16:03] and investigate the things i'm teaching
[16:06] if they don't hold up they won't hold up
[16:08] but if they hold up and the things i'm
[16:10] talking about happen before they happen
[16:12] what does that
[16:14] mean
[16:15] does it mean it's luck
[16:18] no is it leaning on any retail logic no
[16:22] it's not support and resistance it's not
[16:23] supplying demand
[16:25] i'm trading with factors that are
[16:26] outside of that
[16:30] so what is it i'm teaching you
[16:33] liquidity i'm showing you that market
[16:35] efficiency paradigm that i taught early
[16:37] in this series where you are being
[16:40] trained to go into the marketplace and
[16:42] look at how liquidity that is resting in
[16:44] the market or will be engineered
[16:47] to be there where you want it to be
[16:49] what's that mean
[16:50] above old highs
[16:52] those buy stops are being triggered
[16:54] so smart money can go short they're
[16:57] selling short to these buy stops and
[16:59] they're gonna buy it back from resting
[17:01] sell stops that are resting below here
[17:03] sales liquidity
[17:04] so we're not looking at patterns sake
[17:07] trading
[17:08] we're not looking at indicators
[17:10] we're not trying to reinvent the wheel
[17:12] rename old retail logic that's flawed
[17:15] and gimmicked
[17:17] i'm teaching you a whole different
[17:19] perspective on how these markets look
[17:21] they have always looked like this
[17:24] the advantage is
[17:26] that everything is switched
[17:28] to electronic trading that means it's
[17:30] much more efficient and faster
[17:32] so
[17:34] me teaching this
[17:36] is not going to change the fact that
[17:37] this is what goes on
[17:39] okay
[17:40] it will not stop working
[17:42] you will have losing trades if you treat
[17:44] with life funds
[17:45] understand that i have losing trades
[17:47] you're going to have losing trades
[17:49] but you're going to understand
[17:51] why you're wrong
[17:52] you won't beat yourself up about it if
[17:54] you're smart and listen to what i'm
[17:56] telling you to do and avoid the things
[17:57] that toxic thoughts build
[18:00] but you will know more specifically
[18:03] the times
[18:05] and locations where these formations are
[18:07] likely to be successful
[18:10] understand the difference between that
[18:13] it's not promising profitability
[18:15] it's not promising 100
[18:17] win rate i'm not promising you a high
[18:18] rate of return because all of you are in
[18:21] a driver's seat
[18:22] but look at this chart
[18:24] is this not what i outlined before it
[18:26] happened
[18:27] absolutely it is
[18:28] so
[18:30] this is on a daily chart this is
[18:31] answering the folks that say you know i
[18:32] don't want to do this intraday trading
[18:34] with your target audience my target
[18:36] audience is whoever wants to listen
[18:39] and then they're going to take what i'm
[18:40] teaching and scale it to whatever time
[18:42] frame they want to utilize if they want
[18:43] to be a swing trader this is it this is
[18:45] the model that i showed you right here
[18:48] just being applied
[18:49] to this time frame
[18:55] if you don't see the logic behind it
[18:58] it's because you're still early in your
[19:00] stages of development it's okay don't
[19:02] rush it don't be in a hurry to
[19:04] understand everything and feel like
[19:05] you're
[19:06] you're going to lose your mind if you
[19:07] don't have it understood you know in a
[19:09] couple weeks
[19:10] just enjoy the process
[19:12] i'm giving you the logic and i'm showing
[19:14] you where it's going to go before it
[19:15] happens when it's applicable i'm not
[19:17] promising to do that i'm not an oracle
[19:19] for you okay
[19:20] all right so we're looking at
[19:23] this area here
[19:25] where it drops below this old low
[19:27] it does it here and here on a shallow
[19:29] basis but then we have this real nice
[19:31] decline yesterday
[19:33] on monday's trading
[19:34] so i want to take you into this
[19:36] right here and kind of like build on the
[19:39] idea of what liquidity
[19:41] does once it takes out old lows like
[19:43] this what can it do
[19:47] so we're zoomed in on monday's trading
[19:49] here
[19:50] here's friday's trading and i want to
[19:52] take your attention to
[19:54] something i talked way way way back in
[19:56] 2010
[19:58] when i was on baby pips and i was
[20:00] contributing to that community
[20:02] and
[20:03] as
[20:04] a
[20:06] reminder one of the things i taught was
[20:09] study the last three days
[20:11] the open the high the low and the close
[20:14] in the last three days
[20:16] now
[20:17] for those of you that were part of that
[20:19] community back then and knew me then
[20:23] it was my
[20:26] laboratory experiment to see if anybody
[20:28] would start seeing the things that i saw
[20:32] early on in my development because
[20:33] nobody really sat down and said hey ict
[20:36] you know look at the open high low and
[20:37] close in the last three days and you're
[20:38] gonna find this thing okay
[20:40] but
[20:41] if you were doing those types of things
[20:44] nobody not one person
[20:47] came to the realization of the fair
[20:48] value gap
[20:50] nobody did
[20:51] okay
[20:52] so
[20:53] no one's going to be able to come out
[20:54] and say oh yeah i was that guy no i was
[20:56] that gap nobody did that okay
[20:58] i shared this fair value got
[21:00] because number one it's powerful two
[21:04] it's
[21:05] not going to stop working
[21:07] and it's unique to everything else out
[21:09] there
[21:09] and it's very specific where it forms
[21:12] and i give you some criteria on how you
[21:14] can find where they form also that are
[21:16] not necessarily
[21:18] where you might expect
[21:20] but i'm also going to incorporate some
[21:21] of the things like
[21:22] rebalancing
[21:24] and then where does this formation form
[21:29] i want to take your attention into this
[21:30] candle here last friday's low
[21:34] so if this was monday go back the last
[21:35] three days you go here
[21:37] here and here now is there a fair value
[21:39] gap in that no
[21:41] but
[21:43] look what monday's trading did it opened
[21:45] extended down and closed near the low it
[21:48] was rather large range today
[21:50] okay great wonderful what do you do with
[21:51] that information
[21:56] go back to the previous day's low
[21:58] if you go back to the previous day's low
[22:00] this is going to be important
[22:02] because if you do this
[22:04] the next trading day which is tuesday
[22:06] today's production video date
[22:09] the 10th of may 2022 if we open up and
[22:13] because we're below those relative equal
[22:15] lows on the daily chart
[22:17] and we're below this swing low
[22:20] also
[22:22] we're now
[22:23] you know in a deep discount we don't try
[22:25] to pick bottoms
[22:27] okay we don't try to call the long-term
[22:28] lows while markets are bearish try to
[22:30] avoid doing i know it seems like it's
[22:33] possible because everybody makes videos
[22:34] on youtube and they write books and they
[22:36] do articles and they say they did this
[22:38] and say they did that they picked the
[22:40] top they picked the bottom
[22:41] i promise you i know a lot and i have
[22:44] lost more money
[22:47] more money
[22:48] trying to do that than any other thing
[22:51] you don't need to do that
[22:53] okay so now think about what this
[22:56] bias has been
[22:57] on these markets what have i stated
[22:59] publicly you all know
[23:01] i've been bearish right
[23:03] so
[23:04] when you see a big down day like
[23:06] this all the indicators are going to
[23:08] flash oversold
[23:11] oversold
[23:12] okay
[23:14] i'm not trying to pick a bottom but
[23:16] indicator followers will look for
[23:17] bullish divergence because they think
[23:19] they're going to catch the ultimate low
[23:21] and they're gonna ride it up when they
[23:23] even if they were lucky to buy the low
[23:25] the chances of holding it long term
[23:28] not likely so it's a fallacy to try to
[23:31] pursue that don't think like that
[23:33] when we have a bias
[23:35] collectively as traders i'm not just
[23:37] saying me specifically for my model
[23:40] if any of you are trading
[23:42] try to avoid trying to pick the tops and
[23:45] the bottoms there's a lot of meat in
[23:46] between the major turning points
[23:49] and you can afford to be wrong at the
[23:51] end because once you're wrong it'll be
[23:53] obvious then you can get insane and go
[23:54] the other way if you have draw down just
[23:56] work on getting it back and then working
[23:58] that
[23:59] middle of the move type idea
[24:01] it serves you well
[24:03] but i want to take this idea here and
[24:05] we're going to drop down into a lower
[24:06] time frame
[24:08] after we see today's
[24:11] price accident trade right up in here
[24:12] now this looks like an indecisive day
[24:15] so if you're looking at a daily chart it
[24:16] can be a little
[24:18] confusing like you know what took place
[24:20] this is a mixed day they'll call it
[24:24] no
[24:25] no no no no
[24:27] let's go into this
[24:29] formation right here
[24:31] okay i'm going to give you some logic
[24:34] now here's the time when we get into the
[24:36] ict videos that a large percent of you
[24:40] do not want to do this part
[24:43] you're welcome to obviously not listen
[24:45] but you're going to miss the opportunity
[24:47] of learning
[24:49] i want you to look at this price action
[24:50] in this fractal now what is a fractal
[24:52] fractal is a piece of price action
[24:55] that's doing
[24:56] something that i'm trying to draw your
[24:57] attention to okay we're studying a very
[24:59] small segment of price action that's a
[25:01] fractal
[25:02] so
[25:03] if we're looking at this and this is
[25:05] that old
[25:07] low that i extended on the daily chart
[25:09] now it's being visualized on an hourly
[25:11] time frame so every one of these candles
[25:13] is not a daily candle
[25:14] which shows the highest high and lowest
[25:16] level daily range it's now an hourly
[25:18] chart where it shows the highest high
[25:20] and lowest low of each individual hour
[25:23] interval i want you to think about what
[25:25] you see here
[25:26] now for those of you that are new
[25:29] don't be discouraged if you don't see
[25:31] what i'm going to show but
[25:33] pause the video
[25:35] and look for what you can identify from
[25:38] what i've taught you so far in this
[25:40] mentorship
[25:41] do not
[25:42] rush through this pause it think about
[25:44] what you see
[25:46] and then unpause the video when you're
[25:48] ready
[25:53] you know who you
[25:54] are you're missing out you should have
[25:57] paused it
[25:59] alright so let's add some detail first
[26:04] in perspective
[26:05] you want to break your
[26:07] daily ranges up by the day
[26:09] and i talk that midnight starts to cross
[26:12] over to a new day i don't care what
[26:13] anybody else tells you
[26:15] this is how the algorithm works it
[26:16] operates on this timeline okay it's on
[26:19] new york time
[26:20] so
[26:21] at midnight here
[26:23] on tuesday we start here the opening
[26:25] price is here if you draw that out in
[26:27] time
[26:28] it goes up it goes down and it comes
[26:30] right back to the close
[26:33] to where it opened up at midnight and it
[26:34] would get very close to what that daily
[26:36] chart showed that indecisive candle
[26:38] where it was a lot of wick to the upside
[26:40] a little bit of wick down to the
[26:41] downside and a small little body okay
[26:44] that
[26:45] looks indecisive
[26:47] on that time frame
[26:48] but
[26:49] if you look
[26:50] closer and you start framing out the
[26:52] things i taught you
[26:54] here is
[26:56] relative equal highs
[26:59] old low
[27:01] what's resting above relative equal
[27:02] highs
[27:03] buy side liquidity
[27:05] what's resting below and all low
[27:07] sell side liquidity
[27:09] the market runs
[27:11] above
[27:13] at 9 30
[27:15] it hits that old low
[27:18] that red line here that old low it hits
[27:20] that there right at 9 30.
[27:23] then
[27:24] all of the buy side is purged that means
[27:27] all of these spy stops have now been
[27:29] drug into the market by their hair
[27:32] kicking and screaming
[27:35] they're in they're caught long or
[27:37] they've been short and they've been
[27:38] knocked out of their short position
[27:39] either way it doesn't matter to us we
[27:41] just know that that buy side liquidity
[27:43] is likely to be utilized
[27:46] to set up an idea for smart money to be
[27:48] short why because the bias is bearish we
[27:51] have not changed gears
[27:52] we're not trying to pick the bottom
[27:55] so if we're doing this like smart money
[27:58] and we're looking at the market like
[27:59] this and we want to be short up here at
[28:01] this trigger event which we'll look at
[28:02] in a moment
[28:05] where would you want to off set that
[28:08] short position well you have a nice
[28:09] little short term low here so you can
[28:11] take partial below that it hits it
[28:13] beautifully
[28:14] and the previous stays low and it does
[28:16] that
[28:17] run below that low here just as
[28:19] handsomely as it did here
[28:22] so
[28:24] let's go in and use the logic with this
[28:27] idea of rebalancing monday's daily range
[28:32] keying off of this level here
[28:36] notice that the buy side liquidity is
[28:38] ran first
[28:39] this is really important folks
[28:42] if we would have gone down
[28:44] and took the previous low
[28:46] out then ran up here that to me is not
[28:50] bearish
[28:51] this
[28:52] running above buys liquidity here
[28:55] at 9 30
[28:56] hitting that without having this low
[28:59] taken out that is bearish
[29:02] because it's within the context of the
[29:03] bias that we're looking for
[29:05] when we're operating in the
[29:07] a bearish bias what we're essentially
[29:09] saying is the market's going to go up to
[29:11] a premium
[29:13] for one of two reasons run an old high
[29:15] or highs
[29:16] to take out buy side liquidity so that
[29:18] way smart money can counterparty with
[29:20] them with their short positions they're
[29:22] going to sell to those buy stops
[29:24] then seeking to buy cheaper sell side
[29:27] liquidity that would be their pool of
[29:29] liquidity to
[29:30] offset
[29:31] distribute their shorts below here so
[29:34] they're going to sell here at a high
[29:35] price and buy it back at a cheaper price
[29:37] this is not a random unknown low it's in
[29:39] the marketplace soon as that day close
[29:41] that low is known to everyone but the
[29:43] liquidity resting below that is not
[29:45] necessarily a target or utilization for
[29:47] anybody in any other retail idea
[29:50] that's what i'm trying to
[29:51] shake you by your lapels and say pay
[29:53] attention
[29:54] i'm showing you how to look at the
[29:56] marketplace like smart money not like
[29:59] white golf this is not like off okay
[30:01] it's not sam side and stuff
[30:03] all these things that people like to
[30:04] attribute this is not it
[30:06] this is mine this is i'm telling you how
[30:08] these markets operate
[30:10] and if it's not happening after i say it
[30:12] happens or should happen then i'm a
[30:14] fraud it's fake it doesn't hold up but
[30:16] guess what it works folks
[30:18] look at all the people that are now
[30:20] digging their nose in their charts now
[30:21] with this idea
[30:24] come on now
[30:25] it's catching fire because it's
[30:27] simplified now
[30:29] and i'm showing you what works and it's
[30:31] exciting isn't it it's interesting to
[30:33] see these things panning out all the
[30:34] time every single week
[30:36] every single day
[30:37] and it won't stop
[30:40] the second pool of liquidity
[30:42] is the sell side liquidity so it runs
[30:44] the buy side first with the bearish bias
[30:47] so it's doing what i've taught in this
[30:49] mentorship it goes up to a premium
[30:51] then seeks a discount
[30:54] see that
[30:57] now we're going to drop into a 15 minute
[30:58] time frame
[31:00] zoom on in and get a little bit more
[31:01] details here and now i have added the 8
[31:04] 30
[31:06] time frame here
[31:07] and we have the relative equal highs the
[31:09] market at 8 30 we're looking for what to
[31:11] happen
[31:13] the news and bar go to lift that means
[31:15] that the algorithm will start seeking
[31:17] liquidity as early as that time frame
[31:20] now it might wait till 9 30
[31:22] and this candle here is 9 30.
[31:25] notice it hits it right there
[31:27] where we're
[31:28] drawing your attention to because it's
[31:30] rebalancing that entire monday range
[31:33] it's going back to
[31:35] the previous day prior to monday
[31:38] it's old low
[31:39] on friday
[31:40] so when you see that it rebalances the
[31:42] big drop on monday
[31:45] it tricks people into thinking that it's
[31:47] made the low
[31:48] and it's going to keep going up
[31:50] when the only thing it has done is it's
[31:52] gone up to a logical level on that daily
[31:54] time frame
[31:55] that rebalances
[31:57] all of that
[32:00] sell-off on monday
[32:01] it's been rebalanced
[32:03] so
[32:04] if you look at the ninth on the
[32:06] 15-minute time frame this does not look
[32:09] like it's
[32:10] an imbalance but on a daily candle it's
[32:14] a large down day
[32:16] so
[32:16] all of this movement here is big in
[32:18] terms of distribution on the downside
[32:21] this is retracement back up into a
[32:23] logical level which is friday's low
[32:26] and it hits it based on the elements
[32:28] that i taught you and it's following
[32:30] what the logic is that i shared publicly
[32:33] in this series
[32:36] look for relative equal highs at 8 30
[32:40] it's going to start looking for high or
[32:42] highs to run
[32:43] that's these over here how far can it go
[32:46] that's that friday low
[32:49] there's your framework this is that
[32:51] judas swing that fake rally up
[32:53] okay
[32:54] think about what the daily candle looked
[32:56] like
[32:56] before we started dropping down the
[32:58] lower time frames
[32:59] it was a big wick up and a little bit of
[33:01] a wick down but it was a small little
[33:02] body on the candle
[33:04] for tuesday's trading but if you look at
[33:06] it from the lens of power three how i
[33:08] teach you the accumulation
[33:11] at 8 30 use the opening price that's
[33:13] down here draw that out in time
[33:16] the rally should take place above that
[33:18] it's a logical level i'm teaching you
[33:21] then it creates the pattern that's in
[33:23] the mentorship
[33:25] fair value gap
[33:26] market structure shift
[33:28] then starts to show displacement and
[33:31] distribution to the downside attacking a
[33:33] discount array
[33:35] so
[33:38] this is your power three where it opens
[33:39] rally's up creates the high and trades
[33:41] down there's your move power three but
[33:44] it's inside that daily candle that looks
[33:46] indecisive right
[33:47] so you have to understand what you're
[33:49] looking at relative to time and price
[33:52] when you do that it takes away all that
[33:54] confusion it provides more clarity we're
[33:57] going to drop down into a five-minute
[33:59] chart and start building this into a
[34:01] very visual representation of what
[34:03] you've been learning in this series
[34:06] midnight new york
[34:08] news embargo at 8 30 is lifted now there
[34:11] wasn't a whole lot of news this morning
[34:13] admittedly but this
[34:15] still the same logic relative equal
[34:17] highs at 8 30 starts the algorithm
[34:20] what's it going to do it's going to run
[34:21] for a premium why because the bias is
[34:23] bearish it's going to return likely up
[34:25] into that friday low to rebalance
[34:27] monday's trading
[34:29] its bearish candle is being rebalanced
[34:31] and at 9 30 am the equity market opens
[34:35] that's what this little manipulation is
[34:36] okay what is 9 30 that's when you expect
[34:38] this little type of a move but it begins
[34:41] at 8 30.
[34:43] so that hour-long interval
[34:45] we're expecting when we're bearish a run
[34:47] higher to set up shorts
[34:50] now the short can form inside that hour
[34:52] or it could just provide the leg that
[34:54] sets up the framework that will
[34:56] eventually like i'm going to show you
[34:57] here provide you the setup so all all of
[35:01] it is
[35:02] a matter of
[35:04] studying what the market's providing you
[35:06] it doesn't change the rules i'm not
[35:08] bending the rules i'm giving you the
[35:10] logic behind when these algorithms do
[35:13] what they're doing
[35:14] when price starts to spool from 8 30 up
[35:16] in to friday's low
[35:19] at 9 30 that's that manipulation time
[35:22] where they create that little
[35:24] opportunity where it looks like it's
[35:26] going to do something but it's
[35:28] generally the opposite of what it looks
[35:29] like on the chart and large retail is
[35:31] going to see that as it's breaking out
[35:33] it's going higher and they're going to
[35:35] buy it and chase it
[35:36] and then they have their hinder parts
[35:37] handed to them
[35:39] and then they just run the daily range
[35:40] against them to take out the cell side
[35:42] over here
[35:43] okay but i want you to look inside this
[35:45] five minute run here
[35:47] and notice that this whole area is
[35:49] shaded here that's the judah swing
[35:51] that's the fake rally in a
[35:53] down move that will be profitable for
[35:55] shorts
[35:56] but at the time retail won't see that
[35:59] they won't identify they won't it won't
[36:01] make any sense them they'll be caught
[36:03] off guard
[36:04] but i want you to go into that range
[36:06] here
[36:06] this
[36:08] right here
[36:10] that
[36:11] is your displacement
[36:13] price swing that right there
[36:15] that's the leg on a five-minute chart
[36:17] you strip that down
[36:19] and you start going from five
[36:21] four three two and one until you find
[36:24] your fair guy you got
[36:26] so we're going to do that now but i'm
[36:28] showing you how you're going to put your
[36:29] fib on the high
[36:30] and the low of that
[36:32] for those that don't have the benefit of
[36:34] going back into hindsight you may be
[36:35] watching this video far in the future
[36:38] i've included it here that way it's
[36:40] already done for you for for study
[36:41] purposes
[36:42] the
[36:43] 40
[36:45] 44 and a half level is equilibrium or 50
[36:48] of the range between the high and the
[36:50] low that
[36:51] run here that drop down
[36:53] why am i neuting this because we have
[36:56] this swing low broken here
[36:58] now it could have stopped there
[37:00] and started to move up and we would use
[37:02] that range from here to here but it just
[37:04] kept breaking lower lower lower
[37:06] so it broke below this low
[37:08] and what looks like this low here so it
[37:11] was several short-term lows that were
[37:13] broken nonetheless this is the
[37:14] displacement price leg
[37:16] so this price swing here you shade that
[37:19] while you're learning
[37:21] and then you start breaking that down
[37:23] into lower time frames so right now
[37:24] we're on the five minute chart i'm going
[37:26] to keep this shaded area here
[37:29] one but we're just going to transition
[37:31] from the five minute chart down to the
[37:32] four minute chart
[37:35] so here's the four minute chart
[37:37] 9 30 is this candle here that's your
[37:39] judas swing at 8 30 it starts its run
[37:41] this is the algorithmic price run
[37:43] goes to friday's low rebalances the
[37:45] entire range on monday's trading
[37:47] it
[37:48] changes the narrative when retail
[37:50] traders think and it's created the low
[37:52] all the bullish diversions they will be
[37:53] seeing other indicators and such they're
[37:56] they're screaming dubai and breakout
[37:58] artists are looking at this break here
[38:00] because they think this is resistance
[38:01] broken now
[38:02] oh it's coming back down to it this is
[38:04] what is this resistance broken turn
[38:06] support right okay breaks down a little
[38:08] bit okay then it starts running okay oh
[38:10] this is one of those instances where it
[38:12] was
[38:13] you know
[38:14] went past a little bit but it's still
[38:15] going to go higher
[38:17] you can almost read into the price
[38:18] action what retail would be expecting
[38:20] here but we're looking for something
[38:22] very specific
[38:24] in this shaded area here we're looking
[38:25] for a fair value gap do you see a fair
[38:28] value gap
[38:32] of you would say this
[38:34] yeah i didn't know that you read my mind
[38:35] ict
[38:37] why not that one what if that what would
[38:39] happen if i went into that and sold
[38:40] short well first of all if you did that
[38:42] you were not following the rules because
[38:44] from this high down to that low this is
[38:45] equilibrium we need to get to a premium
[38:49] we don't want to sell in a discount
[38:52] that's not what we're doing here so we
[38:54] have to get to this level here 40 44 and
[38:57] a half or higher
[38:59] that's a premium
[39:00] based on that price swing
[39:03] do you understand what i just gave you
[39:05] there
[39:06] like that's a hardline rule that if you
[39:08] just follow that
[39:10] it will keep you out of so
[39:12] many ill-fated
[39:15] scenarios
[39:16] now it's not a hundred percent that
[39:17] you're gonna follow that and never take
[39:19] a losing trade because some of you are
[39:21] asking for that secret recipe like i had
[39:23] that
[39:24] if i had it i wouldn't give it to you
[39:26] okay so it doesn't exist and i don't
[39:29] have it so on both sides of defense just
[39:32] stop looking for that
[39:33] expect to lose money if you're gonna
[39:35] trade and you're using live money you're
[39:37] gonna lose money
[39:38] it's a promise i'm guaranteeing you
[39:40] you're always going to run into a
[39:42] scenario that will eventually lose
[39:44] capital money will be withdrawn from
[39:46] your account it sucks it's not fun
[39:49] nobody signs up for that they sign up
[39:51] for well if it works in my favor i could
[39:53] make money i could
[39:55] make enough money to go on vacation each
[39:56] year i could pay my car note those types
[39:58] of things okay and some of you take it
[39:59] to an extreme where you're going to be
[40:01] rich and you ride around and
[40:02] charge airplanes and drive around in
[40:04] cars that cost too much money
[40:07] to each their own
[40:09] all i'm saying is i'm gonna teach you
[40:10] how to read price
[40:11] okay so let's keep it germane to that
[40:15] so there's no
[40:16] four minute
[40:19] there they go
[40:24] on the three-minute chart inside this
[40:26] pink shaded area that's the displacement
[40:28] leg
[40:30] is there a fair value gap
[40:35] you can pause the video here if you want
[40:37] if you need more time
[40:43] all right for those that
[40:45] are prepared
[40:46] there is no fair value gap here either
[40:49] nothing to do yet
[40:52] so you drop down into your two minute
[40:54] chart
[40:55] okay do you see a fair value gap
[40:58] in the two minute chart you can pause
[41:00] the video if you need more time
[41:07] all right if you're not prepared
[41:10] pause the video
[41:13] lo and behold
[41:15] the unicorn
[41:17] here's the favorite you got
[41:20] small little imbalance right in here
[41:23] and we took out the short term low
[41:25] now some of you might see this if you
[41:28] were watching
[41:29] the two minute chart okay
[41:31] say you watched the two minute chart and
[41:32] you saw this short-term low broken here
[41:34] or maybe this one here and you saw this
[41:37] is this
[41:39] displacement
[41:40] one could argue
[41:42] perhaps it is
[41:43] okay now i'm going to give you
[41:46] the
[41:46] alternative this is not twisting the
[41:49] rules it's just showing you the logic of
[41:51] when you put a trade on in your demo
[41:53] account hear that
[41:56] compliance
[41:59] this movement lower
[42:02] creates that fair bay guy
[42:04] yes we have a short term load taken out
[42:06] there okay
[42:08] this entry
[42:10] on this fair bay gap
[42:12] if you utilize that where would your
[42:14] stop loss be
[42:16] it would have to be at least above the
[42:18] candle that creates the fair bag gap
[42:20] that's this one here
[42:21] so your stop will be above here did it
[42:23] hit it
[42:24] no
[42:26] so
[42:27] even if you would have utilized that
[42:29] you're not stopped out with this right
[42:30] here now you might get scared to death
[42:33] when it running up after it moved in
[42:34] your favor like this then comes back and
[42:36] retraces
[42:38] but you cannot
[42:40] listen to me folks
[42:42] you cannot open a trade up like this and
[42:44] put a stop above here
[42:46] and watch it go down here and want to
[42:48] trail your stop loss real tight you
[42:50] can't do that
[42:51] you have to hold
[42:53] with a certain measure of risk open
[42:57] and this is what
[42:58] filters out so many people in this
[43:00] industry they can't do this
[43:02] they either rush to get out of a trade
[43:04] that's marginally profitable because
[43:06] they can't stand it
[43:07] they're making money and they're so used
[43:09] to seeing it turn against them and stop
[43:11] them out or squeeze them if they don't
[43:12] use stops and they get out with big
[43:14] losing trades
[43:16] once they start getting marginally
[43:18] profitable trades they get out
[43:19] prematurely they don't even hold it for
[43:21] the models rules
[43:23] or
[43:24] they trail their stop-loss so tight so
[43:26] quickly it strangles the position it
[43:27] doesn't even give the chance to move and
[43:29] breathe
[43:30] so how do you do that we're going to
[43:32] talk a little bit about stop placement
[43:33] now
[43:35] initially when opens the trade up the
[43:37] rule is you want to use the candle that
[43:39] creates the fair value you got that high
[43:40] just above that okay one tick two ticks
[43:42] above that that's sufficient enough if
[43:45] you are scared
[43:47] and you just want to use a nice handsome
[43:50] ample stop you would use a swing hot
[43:53] here oh that's a lot of movement so what
[43:56] they have micro account positions that
[43:58] you can trade with
[44:00] so
[44:00] you may not be trading them any
[44:02] trade micros if it requires you that
[44:04] much of a stop to sleep at night
[44:06] okay knowing that what you're doing
[44:08] isn't going to wreck and ruin you
[44:10] then use micros
[44:11] it's five dollars per point or handle
[44:14] versus fifty dollars per handle on a
[44:16] mini
[44:18] so it's scalable it's something that
[44:21] most people should be able to weather if
[44:24] you can't weather something like that
[44:25] with a micro then you're really trading
[44:26] is you're not prepared to trade you
[44:28] don't have enough equity and you're
[44:29] underfunded okay
[44:31] and i don't mean that to be
[44:33] talking down to anybody that's just the
[44:34] real
[44:35] skinny okay a lot of people try to go in
[44:37] here and they want to trade with 100
[44:38] account and you're just asking to fail
[44:41] you really are asking to fail
[44:43] so you can't be under-capitalized but
[44:46] once you place your stop here or
[44:48] here when do you start moving your stop
[44:51] well you want to see
[44:53] a larger
[44:55] shift in structure when this low is
[44:58] taken out down here
[44:59] then
[45:01] then
[45:02] you can move your stop down say it was
[45:03] up here then you can move it to here
[45:05] okay or maybe here
[45:07] why
[45:08] because it's already broke down so it's
[45:10] not going to go down here and come back
[45:12] up here if it does then you're probably
[45:13] wrong or it's going to consolidate which
[45:15] means it's going to be an ugly condition
[45:16] to be working within anyway
[45:19] see the logic there
[45:22] i'm accepting the fact that i'm probably
[45:24] gonna be wrong if it stops me out but
[45:25] who cares if it does
[45:27] why would i have that opinion of not
[45:29] caring if it stops me out
[45:32] how many times have you seen this
[45:33] pattern form
[45:36] think about it over the course of a week
[45:38] how many times does a pattern form
[45:41] it's forming somewhere every day
[45:44] it's flowing everywhere either in the
[45:45] london session overnight highs and lows
[45:48] or it's forming in a new york session
[45:49] i'm teaching the new york session
[45:51] because you have the advantage of
[45:53] knowing what took place in london
[45:55] that's that's why i'm teaching this does
[45:57] it work in london absolutely
[45:59] does it work in asia
[46:02] not
[46:03] that often
[46:05] and that's why i haven't pushed hard for
[46:07] asia i know some of you hey i need to
[46:09] know something in asia for those ideas
[46:12] and those traders that are really
[46:13] focused on
[46:15] trading that time frame
[46:16] and because they have businesses or
[46:18] that's just the way they can trade only
[46:19] it's the time that they can be in front
[46:21] of the charts
[46:23] you want to be trading the yen pairs for
[46:25] forex you want to be trading the new
[46:26] zealand dollar and australian dollar
[46:28] they tend to have a little bit more
[46:29] movement during those periods because
[46:31] that's when their markets start so
[46:34] you can look for this type of pattern to
[46:35] form there on the one through
[46:37] five-minute charts
[46:39] in the asian session so
[46:40] i gave you that that's as far as i'm
[46:42] going to go with it i'm not going to be
[46:43] doing all kinds of videos about it just
[46:45] know it's one of the most ill liquid
[46:47] times for me
[46:49] i'm letting the market create those
[46:51] periods of the day where
[46:54] a lot of traders are starting early
[46:55] because like anything else we're really
[46:57] quick to get into something but we
[47:00] rarely ever finish it
[47:01] and
[47:03] students that come under my wing
[47:05] are really good testimonials about that
[47:07] they'll come in they'll say i'm going to
[47:08] stick with this but then they realize it
[47:10] takes a little bit more effort than
[47:11] they're ready for and they quit
[47:13] and
[47:14] trading in general is like that and they
[47:16] think that because in
[47:18] new zealand
[47:20] wellington doesn't really begin today
[47:22] they think and they teach and all these
[47:23] other traders have to say you know
[47:25] wellington starts the 24-hour cycle and
[47:27] it does not start the cycle this is how
[47:29] you know someone doesn't know what
[47:30] they're talking about
[47:32] these algorithms operate on new york
[47:33] time and it begins at midnight period
[47:35] and the story i don't care who's
[47:36] brother's cousin's sister knows this guy
[47:38] that works at a bank that says ict's
[47:40] fool crap i don't care bring those
[47:42] people here
[47:44] challenge what i'm showing you here okay
[47:46] show me how this is wrong that's all i'm
[47:48] asking because i'm doing it
[47:50] i'm proving it and everybody else is
[47:52] seeing it themselves so
[47:54] do you dismiss the evidence
[47:57] do you ignore it you walk around with
[47:58] blinders on
[47:59] because
[48:00] maybe i'm not the person that fits what
[48:03] you were hoping for in terms of a mentor
[48:05] i'm being honest and i'm proving it i'm
[48:07] showing it to you it's repeating
[48:10] why argue why wrestle with it
[48:13] take it be thankful you know and and do
[48:16] something positive with it
[48:22] so here's what we have
[48:25] we have the whole model
[48:28] identifying a setup
[48:30] moving back to a rebalance of monday's
[48:33] price range
[48:35] back up to friday's low
[48:37] hitting that level there
[48:39] and then creating the setup that's
[48:40] happening at the time elements
[48:42] the same way i teach it in the series
[48:46] and here it is boom comes in hits it
[48:49] breaks down
[48:53] pairs up with a sell side liquidity
[48:56] smart money sells short here
[48:58] and then adds to it here
[49:03] breaks
[49:04] trades in here during the lunch hour
[49:06] your limit order if it was used would be
[49:08] filled during the lunch hour not around
[49:10] 12 30.
[49:11] the only thing about this day that i did
[49:13] not like is i would have rather seen it
[49:15] deliver this movement here just ahead if
[49:18] not right at 12 o'clock
[49:20] that's the only thing that did not line
[49:22] up with what i was expecting today
[49:24] i was looking for this candle right here
[49:26] to punch down and hit that level go
[49:29] through it like it did here and it was
[49:30] just about 27 minutes later
[49:33] so that's not bad right i mean
[49:37] looking at it like this
[49:38] doesn't this make sense
[49:41] seriously folks in
[49:42] closing doesn't this logic
[49:46] make sense
[49:48] the market goes up to trick people and
[49:50] they think it's going to go higher or
[49:51] not those people that are short making
[49:52] money going down in other words
[49:54] their orders that protects them
[49:56] or puts them in a new trade going up or
[49:58] out of a short trade
[50:00] that buy side liquidity is attacked
[50:03] the algorithm goes up there not because
[50:05] people bought it
[50:06] not because smart traders work together
[50:09] to get the trade to go up there because
[50:11] of their buying pressure
[50:14] that's not what this is folks
[50:16] the algorithm goes up there whether
[50:17] there is sufficient volume or not
[50:23] that's
[50:24] the dividing statement when i say those
[50:27] types of things
[50:30] people that think they understand these
[50:32] markets people that have made money
[50:33] doing things that have nothing to do
[50:35] with how these markets book
[50:36] it's hard for them to understand what
[50:38] i'm saying because
[50:40] their faith based religion on their
[50:43] system
[50:45] prevents them from seeing the obvious
[50:47] logic that's being shown here
[50:49] these markets are controlled they're
[50:51] rigged and they're algorithmically
[50:53] driven
[50:55] how many times do you need to see these
[50:57] things before you can just lay down
[51:00] all the other ideas
[51:03] there's no reason to buy other people's
[51:05] courses and i'm not going to get flamed
[51:07] for this and then i'm gonna invite more
[51:08] trolls i don't care
[51:10] okay
[51:11] you don't need to buy
[51:13] any courses
[51:15] you don't need to be in anybody else's
[51:17] subscriptions
[51:18] okay teaching rehash stuff
[51:22] what i'm showing you here
[51:24] if you put the time in learning this
[51:26] you will not need to do anything else
[51:30] period you won't need to worry about
[51:32] breakers so you won't need to worry
[51:33] about mitigation blocks you won't need
[51:35] to worry about buy side bill and sell
[51:37] side inefficiencies
[51:38] none of those things
[51:40] that's also taught in the things i teach
[51:42] in my private group why
[51:44] why would you want anything more than
[51:46] this this is so easy
[51:48] this is so easy it doesn't inundate you
[51:50] with so many things and variables that's
[51:52] what's going on right now i'm gonna be
[51:53] honest with you folks
[51:56] my private group which no one can join
[51:57] anymore
[51:59] is so
[52:01] rich
[52:02] with things that make it almost
[52:04] impossible for most of the students to
[52:07] pick what they are going to settle in
[52:09] because
[52:09] everything i show works
[52:12] but they can't
[52:13] settle in on one thing because they're
[52:15] like a kid in a candy store
[52:16] and because of that they're not really
[52:18] fully engaging with one specific
[52:20] approach with this
[52:22] listen to the comments we'll read the
[52:24] comments actually some of them are
[52:26] actually in the comments saying
[52:28] this worked for me and they've been
[52:30] charter members for years what was it
[52:33] i did what i've trained them to do but
[52:35] they weren't willing to do on their own
[52:36] which is take what makes
[52:39] sense
[52:40] one pattern one setup
[52:42] applied time and price
[52:43] theories that i teach around the
[52:44] algorithmic ideas
[52:46] and then look for that one setup and
[52:48] submit to it just that and make it very
[52:50] very simple
[52:52] that's what this is folks
[52:54] i can do this with a breaker
[52:56] i can do this with a mitigation block i
[52:58] can do this with a
[53:02] just a stop run on buy stops i can do it
[53:04] with a run on cell stops i can simplify
[53:07] all this
[53:08] anything i trade with i can do this
[53:11] the same way i can strip it down to a
[53:12] simple model
[53:14] there's no need to ask me to join my
[53:16] private group folks so
[53:18] please stop asking in the comment
[53:19] section please stop sending me emails i
[53:22] don't want your money
[53:24] i don't need your money okay i don't
[53:26] need any of those types of things
[53:28] i i want to do what i'm doing here i
[53:30] enjoy this
[53:31] i have a t-shirt at heart i love doing
[53:33] this and the fact that i'm seeing so
[53:36] many people around the world dive into
[53:38] this and find their own niche in it and
[53:41] it only takes the time to invest in
[53:44] reading
[53:45] the things i'm showing in the chart
[53:47] listening to the logic i'm teaching in
[53:48] the audio commentary and then doing the
[53:50] homework assignments of back testing and
[53:53] looking at it
[53:54] you will decide at that moment
[53:58] if this is something that fits you if it
[53:59] doesn't fit you there's no harm in that
[54:02] i'm not offended by that i have people
[54:04] that paid me that said i just can't make
[54:06] this work for me and i have other people
[54:07] that are killing it
[54:11] what's the difference
[54:12] personality
[54:14] and capacity
[54:16] some people can't do it at all some
[54:17] people can do it they just haven't done
[54:19] the proper things in the right order
[54:24] this is a simplification
[54:26] what i have done here in this series
[54:29] whether you realize it or not
[54:32] my mentorship group that have paid me
[54:35] some of them were kicking and screaming
[54:36] because i've done this
[54:38] others majority have been very
[54:41] appreciative because they have used this
[54:42] to help understand what it is that they
[54:44] should be doing with all the other
[54:45] things i taught
[54:46] now when i say that it sounds like i'm
[54:48] dangling a carrot oh he's got more
[54:50] secret stuff and this is better there is
[54:52] nothing more
[54:55] easier
[54:57] readily made just go out and start doing
[54:59] what i
[55:00] than this okay
[55:02] i swear to you
[55:04] okay listen folks this is an invitation
[55:07] if you are a
[55:09] private member of my mentorship
[55:11] okay
[55:13] tell everyone in the comment section
[55:16] that
[55:16] this is something that has been spelled
[55:18] out very simply and plainly
[55:21] better than any other model
[55:23] that i've done i've done 12 specific
[55:25] trading models in my
[55:27] private mentorship
[55:29] this one here i stripped down i made it
[55:30] very very simple with the expectation my
[55:32] daughter would learn it
[55:36] this
[55:37] is the easiest
[55:39] ict application
[55:41] you're ever going to get
[55:43] i literally sat down and said how can i
[55:45] take something that
[55:47] my daughter who has no interest
[55:48] whatsoever
[55:50] none
[55:51] how can i make this so that way she
[55:52] could see it when to expect it when will
[55:55] it form how to figure out where it
[55:57] should be
[55:59] and what do you do once it forms
[56:02] that's what i've done here
[56:05] is it hard
[56:07] for some of you it would it would feel
[56:08] like it is because i'm reading some of
[56:10] the comments
[56:11] and it's because you haven't spent
[56:12] enough time that's all but i promise you
[56:15] when there's more examples shown and you
[56:16] go through the videos a few times
[56:19] it'll start to
[56:20] become more clear
[56:22] if you're trying to apply other things
[56:24] like bollinger bands and garbage like
[56:26] that
[56:28] you're you're not using the model and
[56:30] you're not going to get the results that
[56:31] would be otherwise available to you if
[56:33] you just do what i'm telling you to do
[56:34] and avoid the things i'm telling you to
[56:36] avoid
[56:37] that's it
[56:38] i promise you this
[56:40] if you give this
[56:42] um
[56:43] three months
[56:44] of study
[56:45] serious
[56:47] sleaze rolled up diligently going in
[56:49] every single day back testing and
[56:50] looking at it
[56:52] and then
[56:54] for at least two or three more months of
[56:56] forward testing it
[56:58] six months
[57:00] six months with just what i've taught
[57:02] here
[57:04] i am confident i am absolutely confident
[57:08] that you will have found
[57:10] your
[57:11] model
[57:12] it's simple it's role based
[57:15] it's visually pleasing to see because
[57:17] you know what you're looking for it's a
[57:19] specific time
[57:21] pattern
[57:22] with the algorithm so you're getting in
[57:24] sync with what the algorithm is going to
[57:26] do just like smart money does
[57:29] okay
[57:30] you want to be like the composite man
[57:33] this is what the composite man's doing
[57:36] he's not looking at white golf
[57:37] schematics
[57:38] and i know that might upset some of you
[57:40] that's not my intent
[57:42] but they're looking at liquidity like
[57:44] this
[57:46] they're looking at how the market's
[57:47] going to
[57:48] allow them
[57:50] to fleece
[57:52] the uninitiated
[57:55] that's just the way it works folks
[57:58] you might not like it it might feel
[58:00] unfair so therefore i don't want to
[58:01] believe this guy he's talking
[58:03] conspiracies
[58:05] call it whatever you want to call it
[58:07] i call it the market
[58:09] until next time
[58:11] be safe
