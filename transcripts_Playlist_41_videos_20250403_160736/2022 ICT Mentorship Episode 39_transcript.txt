[00:09] all right folks welcome back
[00:12] all right so we're looking at the s p
[00:14] futures contract for june 2022 on the
[00:17] left-hand side you can see that we have
[00:18] a daily chart
[00:20] and on the right-hand side it's a
[00:21] one-hour chart so i'm only going to do
[00:22] this
[00:23] to like save time also bring your
[00:25] attention to levels that are
[00:28] sensitive on one time frame higher time
[00:30] frame and how it's subordinate on the
[00:33] lower time frame to those higher time
[00:34] frame levels
[00:36] if you don't know what i'm referring to
[00:37] obviously you'll understand more as we
[00:39] go through
[00:42] all right so this morning i had a
[00:45] short little
[00:46] video that i posted
[00:48] about how we had recently been in this
[00:50] trading range in here
[00:53] and if we were to start to move higher
[00:54] and had displacement to the upside
[00:58] this could have been a draw on liquidity
[01:00] this is the objective i was looking for
[01:03] near term if we were to break higher we
[01:06] had news this morning
[01:08] and unemployment data which obviously
[01:11] you know given the state of affairs at
[01:13] present
[01:16] it's a heavy weight around the neck of
[01:18] the markets so
[01:20] we had a move lower
[01:22] prior to
[01:24] the opening at 9 30.
[01:26] i talked about how
[01:27] until we had some kind of displacement i
[01:30] wasn't really excited about doing much
[01:31] in the marketplace
[01:33] i felt that
[01:35] 40 70
[01:37] was a
[01:38] nice
[01:39] draw on liquidity which would be below
[01:40] these routes to equal those
[01:44] i posted that obviously before 9 30 a.m
[01:47] so it gave you a
[01:49] a target okay or my bias
[01:52] so i'm thinking what if i'm pointing
[01:55] down here
[01:56] before 9 30
[01:58] am i suggesting that we're going to go
[01:59] up here or here or here
[02:01] no
[02:03] so i'm looking for evidence to support
[02:05] the idea that i run below these relative
[02:07] equal lows
[02:08] is warranted
[02:10] i also stated if we went below those
[02:12] lows
[02:14] that we would draw into
[02:16] that fair value cut
[02:18] now with the benefit of hindsight
[02:20] obviously
[02:20] i'm talking to folks that have not been
[02:23] with me or they watched
[02:25] only
[02:26] post production or post market reviews
[02:29] or things like that
[02:30] it sounds like hindsight but i assure
[02:33] you the folks over there on twitter
[02:35] and it's time and date stamped
[02:37] i don't delete any tweet and if it's a
[02:39] typo it stays okay
[02:41] and in my age
[02:43] and my eyes failing like they are it's
[02:45] probably going to be a reoccurring theme
[02:46] over there that i type something
[02:48] correctly
[02:49] but
[02:50] i'm not sweeping anything under the rug
[02:52] i'm not trying to hide anything from you
[02:54] i came out in video explained that i
[02:56] would be more interested in seeing
[02:58] this level down in here and if we did
[03:02] we would draw into this area here now
[03:05] that is suggesting several things number
[03:08] one we're expecting the volatility or
[03:10] i'm expecting the volatility
[03:12] to be significant enough to take us
[03:13] below these lows and if that was to
[03:15] occur
[03:17] then we're going to draw all the way
[03:18] down into here which means what we're
[03:20] going to have a small range day on the
[03:22] daily chart
[03:24] or a large range day
[03:26] clearly a large range day
[03:29] so
[03:30] there was a lot of things that i laid in
[03:32] your hands this morning
[03:34] that
[03:36] hopefully give you hope that these
[03:37] things are
[03:39] predictable obviously i'm not without
[03:42] imperfections uh yesterday i mapped out
[03:45] an idea on twitter and engaged and i
[03:48] took a loss
[03:49] it was a five point loss it was not a
[03:52] significant loss
[03:54] and in fact i called
[03:55] a level later in the afternoon how i
[03:58] could have easily gained that back now
[04:02] when i say those things
[04:04] understand
[04:05] the premise okay why why am i saying
[04:07] that am i saying it to beat my chest and
[04:10] sound egotistical no
[04:14] i wanted everyone to see what it's like
[04:16] even if i do something wrong and i don't
[04:18] rush out there to try to fix it
[04:21] okay
[04:22] because that's going to be
[04:24] your initial response to you taking a
[04:26] losing trade in your demo account or
[04:28] worst case scenario rush into trading
[04:31] live funds when none of you are ready to
[04:33] do that yet now i understand there's
[04:35] traders in here that are watching the
[04:36] videos and you're probably profitable
[04:38] when i say that you shouldn't be trading
[04:40] with live funds
[04:41] you shouldn't be treating with life
[04:42] funds with these concepts because you're
[04:43] still learning them
[04:46] which i'll
[04:47] end this video
[04:49] with a
[04:50] request from all of you so you guys can
[04:52] let me know in the comment section what
[04:54] you would like to see going forward i
[04:56] have a suggestion and you guys are open
[04:58] to give me input on that and you as a
[05:00] community will let me know what it is
[05:02] that we're going to be doing
[05:08] all right so on the daily chart to the
[05:10] left you can see we have those relative
[05:13] equal lows i mentioned the draw on
[05:14] liquidity was there so i was focusing
[05:16] what
[05:17] sell side or i had a bearish spice
[05:21] i gave conditions that we went below
[05:23] there it's not going to go down there to
[05:25] go up it's going to go down into this
[05:27] area here
[05:28] so with those levels transposed over to
[05:30] the hourly chart now
[05:33] this level here
[05:35] is this level on the daily chart
[05:38] this level down here
[05:40] is this level
[05:41] now obviously some of you're like that's
[05:43] pretty obvious but you'd be surprised
[05:45] how many new students i have and they
[05:47] get lost in the time frames so whatever
[05:49] you're doing on your higher time frame
[05:51] you want to start your annotations there
[05:52] but keep them simple you want to see a
[05:55] level that it's going to draw to
[05:57] and or what key levels that may be a
[05:59] factor for changing or
[06:03] suggesting a bias is in play as i did
[06:06] this morning
[06:07] i said i believe we're going to go down
[06:09] below here i thought that's likely to
[06:10] occur
[06:11] and if that does happen
[06:13] we're drawing into this area here not
[06:15] just
[06:15] going below relative equal lows to go
[06:17] higher because there's a lot of people
[06:18] all around the world that are being
[06:19] exposed to my content whether it be
[06:21] directly from me or someone that's
[06:23] learned
[06:24] my concepts and have tried to create
[06:25] something new
[06:27] with a you know twist of their own
[06:29] they're
[06:30] teaching that it's always a relative
[06:32] equal low or equal lows to hit those and
[06:35] then go the other way that's not the
[06:36] case
[06:38] narrative must be understood and
[06:40] narrative unfortunately requires
[06:42] experience and experience is
[06:44] what i'm lending you so when i'm talking
[06:47] to you or if i'm pointing to something
[06:49] i'm lending
[06:50] my three decades of experience doing it
[06:52] so that way you can hopefully grow
[06:54] faster but i'm not trying to rush you
[06:56] along but it's easier for a student to
[06:58] be engaged when they're
[07:00] shown something to anticipate something
[07:03] and then they have the benefit and
[07:04] enjoyment of watching it pan out in
[07:06] their own charts which i think that's
[07:08] the epiphany to every student under me
[07:11] and i guess anyone else
[07:12] when they have that moment of
[07:13] astonishment where it delivers as
[07:15] they're expecting or hoping to see
[07:17] happen
[07:18] it feels like they're in alignment with
[07:20] the marketplace which is many times not
[07:22] the case for retail traders and new
[07:24] traders
[07:26] or long-term
[07:28] you know struggling traders that or
[07:30] break-even is can't find their footing
[07:31] and can't be profitable
[07:34] it's a wonderful feeling
[07:36] and
[07:37] i know once you have that moment you'll
[07:39] want to dig deeper
[07:40] and that inspires me as a mentor too so
[07:42] if you watched this pan out today
[07:44] and you
[07:46] expected it based on being in the
[07:47] community and audience members this
[07:49] morning before the market opened up with
[07:51] my commentary
[07:53] uh give me a heads up in the comment
[07:54] section and what was it like to watch it
[07:56] unfold so over here on the hourly chart
[07:58] we had a
[07:59] fair value gap here
[08:01] swing low we had displacement we
[08:03] consolidated going into midnight
[08:06] last night new york time it rallied up
[08:09] traded into a fair value gap here and up
[08:12] into the bearish order block
[08:13] so we have
[08:15] this order block it touches it
[08:17] you can take that trade but i'm trying
[08:19] to
[08:20] draw your attention to these areas here
[08:23] okay where there's three candles
[08:25] one candle in the middle that has an
[08:27] exposed area that is not overlapped with
[08:29] the previous candles low
[08:31] immediate candle to the right of it so
[08:34] there's that little section that we call
[08:35] a fair there you go
[08:38] price goes above it hits the order block
[08:40] but look at the candles see how the
[08:42] candles bodies
[08:44] stay predominantly in between these two
[08:46] levels here
[08:48] so yeah there's a wick
[08:49] and there's a wick but
[08:51] largely the volume
[08:53] is encapsulated in between these two
[08:55] levels
[08:58] i drew your attention here
[09:00] i mentioned how we would like to go
[09:01] below those lows
[09:02] and then
[09:04] we have an old low back here so even if
[09:05] we weren't looking at my commentary or
[09:08] watching it
[09:10] this framework here then running to that
[09:12] low is something that you should have
[09:14] identified
[09:15] but if you didn't it's okay you'll get
[09:17] it in time
[09:19] this price or level here is the opening
[09:21] price at midnight new york local time
[09:23] so i'm extending that out in time so now
[09:26] think about what i've done so far here
[09:29] before the fact
[09:30] in twitter in a video
[09:33] and in a post
[09:35] i stated that
[09:37] i'm interested in seeing these taken out
[09:39] and i like 470
[09:41] as an interest okay that's a draw in
[09:43] liquidity so for up here
[09:46] and i'm stating that i think
[09:48] 40 70 is interesting
[09:51] your eye should go to that level and
[09:53] study what is at that level
[09:56] that may be of interest to me
[09:59] so that way it forces you to dig into
[10:00] the chart now in the beginning working
[10:02] with me as your mentor this is going to
[10:04] be very frustrating for some of you
[10:05] because unfortunately some of you just
[10:06] want it spelled out for you and i don't
[10:09] teach that way
[10:10] you're not going to learn that way and
[10:11] i'm going to spoon feed you and you're
[10:13] going to learn better
[10:15] and more
[10:17] productively
[10:19] by you going in doing the very things
[10:20] that you would be doing if you didn't
[10:22] need me holding your hand which means
[10:24] going into the charts looking for the
[10:25] evidence and
[10:26] details you know yourself
[10:29] so
[10:31] you had a bearish bias given to you you
[10:33] had an objective a draw on liquidity
[10:36] and
[10:38] in the chart here i'm showing you the
[10:40] framework for the daily range the
[10:41] opening price at midnight
[10:44] i teach they're typically if there's
[10:46] going to be a down day which is what i
[10:47] was suggesting
[10:48] before the market opens at 9 30
[10:51] we would see a bearish day and look for
[10:53] a draw to 470. if that occurs
[10:56] your attention should be down between
[10:58] these two levels here based on that
[10:59] daily chart okay
[11:02] now
[11:02] incorporate power three
[11:04] my power three concept is the
[11:06] accumulation
[11:08] of shorts the manipulation of those
[11:10] individuals that were already short
[11:11] that's what this is here that's a judas
[11:13] swing the market goes up to a short-term
[11:15] premium which is high
[11:17] to low
[11:18] back into a premium relative to this
[11:20] dealing range high and that dealing
[11:22] range low then the market breaks lower
[11:25] trades below the short term relative
[11:27] equal lows here
[11:28] retraces
[11:30] consolidates a little bit breaks once
[11:32] more
[11:33] consolidates and then attacks the cell
[11:35] side here and aggressively runs through
[11:37] the 470 which is what we were
[11:39] anticipating based on my commentary
[11:41] before the market opened
[11:43] and then we take our attention down to
[11:44] here
[11:46] so if you are short
[11:48] you take a partial here
[11:50] then you wait for the daily range to
[11:52] fulfill
[11:52] that means you have to submit yourself
[11:54] to time
[11:55] what time three o'clock to four o'clock
[11:58] wait to that last hour of trading
[12:00] because you'll get the delivery of price
[12:02] when it trades down into that
[12:10] all right now we have the 15 minute time
[12:11] frame on the left-hand side and the
[12:12] five-minute chart on the right
[12:15] you can see how we rallied up into that
[12:18] fairway gap on the hourly
[12:21] we broke
[12:22] down once more traded back above the
[12:25] opening price at midnight here
[12:29] breaks lower
[12:32] consolidates
[12:34] all of this we'll talk about later in
[12:35] the video
[12:37] then breaks once more trades up into a
[12:38] fear of a gap here
[12:42] breaks lower and aggressively runs into
[12:44] that higher time frame daily fair value
[12:45] got
[12:48] on the five minute chart
[12:50] you can see here we have the equities
[12:51] opening
[12:52] at 9 30 a.m
[12:54] here and
[12:56] i mentioned when we were down here i
[12:57] said price
[12:59] is initially showing weakness it's going
[13:01] lower
[13:02] traders are going to get caught short
[13:03] doing that
[13:05] chasing price going lower
[13:07] they're gonna
[13:08] reprice the 4105
[13:10] there's buy side liquidity resting there
[13:12] and a fair value gap the market
[13:14] immediately after my post runs to that
[13:16] level
[13:17] i engaged that with a demo trade i
[13:19] entered it
[13:21] and i
[13:22] took profits below that short term low
[13:23] here
[13:24] and then i'll teach you how i knew this
[13:27] was reversing on me and saved my stop
[13:29] and also took a second partial off
[13:31] it routed once more
[13:33] blowing out that short-term high so we
[13:35] have a lot of chop in the initial
[13:37] opening range
[13:38] low
[13:39] higher high than that high
[13:41] lower low than that low
[13:43] lower low again
[13:45] then rally through this high
[13:47] and left this fair value got
[13:49] consolidated a little bit in here trade
[13:51] it back down in
[13:53] once more back into the opening price at
[13:55] midnight which is this line here
[13:58] if you're bearish you want to be going
[14:00] short at or above that level or as close
[14:02] as you can get to it
[14:04] like this one here
[14:06] okay the market drops down
[14:08] between 11 o'clock and noon it
[14:10] consolidates
[14:13] then retraces back up
[14:15] takes by side here
[14:16] breaks lower returns back to
[14:20] a swing low which we'll talk about in a
[14:22] moment
[14:23] breaks lower again aggressively runs for
[14:25] that 470 level and it's off to the races
[14:27] down into the daily fair bay you got
[14:36] now if you look at the daily range
[14:37] through the scope of a five-minute chart
[14:39] here
[14:40] you can see the opening price here at
[14:41] midnight
[14:42] prices gravitates around that
[14:45] and in london
[14:46] they rally and start building in a
[14:48] premium ahead of the 8 30
[14:52] time window
[14:54] the market creates the high
[14:56] breaks
[15:00] takes out short-term cell side liquidity
[15:02] here retraces back up into
[15:06] consolidates
[15:07] for the majority of the afternoon
[15:10] then it breaks lower and then
[15:12] aggressively attacks the
[15:14] cell side below 470 and then going right
[15:16] back down to that 440 level
[15:19] and then hanging out and consolidating
[15:21] and closing
[15:22] inside that larger daily fair value got
[15:29] now i want you to take a look at this
[15:31] price action here we're looking at the
[15:33] afternoon
[15:35] so
[15:36] with the morning aside because
[15:38] i walked everyone through that basically
[15:40] on twitter and with pre-market analysis
[15:42] and commentary
[15:45] the rules for a
[15:47] afternoon session trade
[15:51] before
[15:52] you even consider trading in the
[15:54] afternoon session you have to consider
[15:56] what is the daily range trying to do
[15:59] is it trying to expand higher is it
[16:00] trying to expand lower
[16:02] did it reverse
[16:04] in the morning session
[16:06] and is it going to have a counter trend
[16:07] move or is it going to just consolidate
[16:09] because it's waiting on a big news event
[16:11] the following day
[16:14] today we had a big news event
[16:16] we had employment data
[16:19] the market consolidated
[16:22] and we had a bearish bias we were
[16:24] looking for 40 70 based on my experience
[16:26] i was generous enough to give that to
[16:27] you beforehand with commentary
[16:29] suggesting it would trade down to that
[16:30] lower time frame fair value gap on the
[16:33] ema s p's daily chart so the framework
[16:36] was one-sided it was not ambiguous it
[16:38] was specific about what we were looking
[16:40] for
[16:42] once the market started to break
[16:45] after lunch when does lunch end at one
[16:47] o'clock in the afternoon new york local
[16:49] time
[16:50] that is here
[16:52] so
[16:53] 12
[16:54] to 1
[16:59] there is our
[17:02] new york lunch
[17:05] if we're bearish what did i teach you
[17:08] the market will do what
[17:10] it will clear the stops
[17:13] during the lunch hour
[17:16] what highs were formed in the lunch hour
[17:18] here and prior to it going in this was
[17:21] the bicep liquidity pool or short-term
[17:23] high
[17:24] so at one o'clock the algorithm reprices
[17:27] and runs
[17:30] to take the stops above the buy side
[17:33] here so during the lunch hour
[17:36] we're seeing that they took the stops
[17:37] here
[17:39] you can
[17:40] if you're aggressive you can put on a
[17:43] trade here because we're in a
[17:44] directional move
[17:46] we're trying to
[17:47] anticipate a large range day in large
[17:50] range days
[17:51] can typically form
[17:54] with a busy lunch schedule and i just
[17:57] recently taught this
[17:58] that the market if it's going to be a
[18:00] fast market
[18:03] during the lunch hour it can create
[18:05] a significant higher significant low
[18:08] but the premise mainly is
[18:11] if you're bearish you're going to be
[18:12] looking for
[18:13] the highs to be swept
[18:15] because they don't want
[18:18] participants to be profitable that may
[18:20] have assumed a short position from the
[18:22] morning session
[18:24] or
[18:25] prior to this high forming
[18:27] they may have already been short here
[18:30] and instead of letting the market
[18:32] release and break to lower
[18:34] pd arrays in a discount market the
[18:36] algorithm reprices knocks those
[18:38] individuals out because it floods the
[18:39] market with what buyers at a higher
[18:42] price higher than what than it was here
[18:44] than it was here
[18:46] so
[18:47] smart money utilizes this
[18:49] run above the short-term high as an
[18:51] influx of
[18:53] buying
[18:54] interest
[18:55] and liquidity
[18:57] that's available immediately
[18:59] while the market's being priced here and
[19:01] held
[19:02] at that level
[19:05] smart money will go in and sell
[19:08] to those buyers
[19:09] that their orders will be resting about
[19:10] here so their stops are being tripped
[19:13] their short position is being knocked
[19:16] out
[19:16] and
[19:18] conversely there's traders that would
[19:20] see that high being broken as a means of
[19:22] getting long and they have a buy stop
[19:24] that would trigger them getting in on a
[19:26] breakout
[19:27] so smart money is
[19:29] cannibalizing those two types of orders
[19:32] what orders are they
[19:34] buy side liquidity
[19:37] so the counterparty to their short has
[19:40] to have
[19:41] buying interest that buying interest is
[19:43] being engineered by the algorithm and it
[19:45] runs up here
[19:48] so smart money goes short here
[19:50] with the expectation that they can take
[19:52] off
[19:54] a portion here
[19:56] back to an old low of 470
[19:58] and then 440 and then into that fair
[20:01] value gap on the daily chart
[20:03] now
[20:05] sticking to the rules of the model i'm
[20:07] trying to teach you if you do not trade
[20:09] during the lunch hour that's fine you're
[20:11] going to wait until
[20:13] after lunch before i set up the form
[20:17] those of you that have been studying my
[20:19] channel here on youtube
[20:20] you understand that this swing low here
[20:23] to a higher high
[20:25] than that of here
[20:26] is a breaker
[20:27] okay that's my ict bearish breaker
[20:30] what is a breaker a breaker is a pattern
[20:32] where price runs out
[20:35] a pool of liquidity in this case is a
[20:37] buy side liquidity pool
[20:38] and then it reverses and trades back
[20:40] down below that short-term low
[20:42] if it trades back up to that and the
[20:44] narrative is bearish
[20:46] notice that it's not just simply we have
[20:47] this pattern here and that's all it is
[20:49] no you must know what the market's
[20:50] likely to be reaching for if you leave
[20:53] that out
[20:55] it's not a breaker
[20:57] it's a gamble it's a guess
[20:59] it's a speculation
[21:00] that's aimless
[21:04] notice the difference there
[21:06] so this down closed candle the lowest
[21:08] one prior to move up clearing that
[21:10] short-term high and i teach this on the
[21:12] youtube channel so
[21:13] if you've already gone through the 2022
[21:16] mentorship videos and you're caught up
[21:18] you're welcome to go through the other
[21:19] videos as well but
[21:21] i'm trying to keep your focus in this
[21:22] series because it's very easy for you to
[21:25] go into other series on this youtube
[21:27] channel
[21:29] and get inundated with things and create
[21:31] so many questions that
[21:33] will feel like they are pertinent to
[21:35] this model and they're not okay but i'm
[21:38] just giving you a comprehensive view of
[21:40] what it is i look at in price
[21:42] what i'm judging whether or not is it
[21:44] likely to continue going lower and as
[21:46] price starts to move back up in this
[21:48] level i would expect and anticipate that
[21:50] level repelling price and go lower
[21:52] and then be aggressive about trading
[21:54] below that because there's sell side
[21:55] there and then not going below this low
[21:58] here to go higher we want to see it go
[22:00] through there and accelerate going down
[22:02] it wants to run quickly for that 40 70
[22:04] level because there's larger pool
[22:06] liquidity below that
[22:08] and then aggressively run into that fair
[22:10] value gap on the daily chart because
[22:12] that's the imbalance that the algorithm
[22:14] is going to want to reprice too
[22:21] in the afternoon obviously you can see
[22:24] post breaker being traded too
[22:27] heaviness falls
[22:28] below 40 70 and then accelerates see
[22:31] that see how fast it accelerates down
[22:34] small little consolidation no
[22:35] retracement
[22:37] no return back to an old low broken
[22:39] support becomes resistance forget about
[22:41] it this is an algorithmic cell day
[22:45] retail doesn't get to do a lot of those
[22:47] retail concepts you either are on board
[22:49] beforehand or you watch the ship sail
[22:52] off without you
[22:54] okay and that's basically what you end
[22:56] up seeing here in the price of 440
[22:59] it gets traded through and back into
[23:01] that daily fair value gap as i mentioned
[23:03] would be the likely target for today
[23:10] all right so this brings me to the point
[23:12] of the video i promised everyone on
[23:14] twitter that i would touch on
[23:16] and
[23:17] i did a little bit of a rant on
[23:20] saturday i took my car out for a spin
[23:24] and you all got to see what it's like to
[23:26] be around ict
[23:29] where i don't have the benefit of having
[23:30] the
[23:32] camtasia studio
[23:34] editing out because there's a lot of
[23:35] times while i'm making these videos
[23:38] that things in the house will go on my
[23:39] kids will interrupt me my dogs will come
[23:41] in and bust in the door and you want me
[23:43] to play with them
[23:45] or i'll say something wrong
[23:47] and get upset about
[23:49] doing something incorrectly while i'm
[23:50] producing the video so they're like uh
[23:53] you know
[23:54] human traits
[23:56] you know i'm i'm a human being i make
[23:58] choices sometimes that aren't the best
[24:00] ones and sometimes you know i'm prone to
[24:04] have chemical imbalances because i'm
[24:06] bipolar and i don't make any excuses for
[24:08] that i don't make any
[24:10] uh
[24:12] attempt to hide it because i know if you
[24:15] spend time with me long enough you'll
[24:17] notice it so during the rant i gave on
[24:20] the twitter spaces
[24:22] i guess it's like a podcast feature to
[24:24] try to build up on that platform
[24:26] i tested it out this weekend and i
[24:28] mentioned that i would
[24:30] share with you all
[24:32] the model i'm teaching my son caleb
[24:36] i'm not afraid to teach it to you i'm
[24:38] not trying to hide it from you okay but
[24:40] i wanted to make sure he had some
[24:42] foundation to what it is he's trying to
[24:43] do
[24:45] and i wanted to spend time with him
[24:48] and figure out like because of his
[24:50] characteristics
[24:52] you know what's his concerns what's his
[24:53] fears
[24:55] what's his comfort level is he trying to
[24:57] you know
[24:59] trade the whole daily range or if you're
[25:00] trying to get in and out real quick
[25:02] small little pieces
[25:03] that type of
[25:05] personality
[25:06] you know inquiry that you have to do as
[25:08] a trader too
[25:09] you don't take a model because you see
[25:11] somebody else doing well with it and say
[25:12] i'm going to do that because if it
[25:14] doesn't match your personality if it
[25:16] doesn't match the way you see and engage
[25:18] price action you'll never make it work
[25:20] for you
[25:21] okay
[25:22] so
[25:24] i'm aware of that i'm cognizant of that
[25:26] effect on
[25:28] individuals learning things not just
[25:29] this but anything
[25:31] but with something so technical as this
[25:33] in this industry with
[25:35] as many as
[25:37] we have in terms of variables for
[25:39] choices what to do
[25:40] you know think about all the indicators
[25:42] that are out there think about all the
[25:44] the trading styles and methodologies and
[25:46] teachers and their respective
[25:48] personalities
[25:50] so you have to be able to number one be
[25:52] able to put up with them
[25:54] and listen to them to learn from them
[25:56] and sometimes i'm off-putting like i
[25:57] can't
[25:58] retain the attention of everyone
[26:00] and or
[26:02] they don't like my teaching style or
[26:04] they don't have any faith in me or
[26:05] whatever
[26:06] i'm not gonna
[26:07] scratch the itch for everyone
[26:09] but
[26:10] for those that sit down here and they
[26:12] want to learn from me
[26:14] obviously you've seen live accounts
[26:16] being utilized this year my son
[26:18] started trading in the first week of may
[26:21] of this year
[26:22] he started trading a live account
[26:24] and he opened up with amp
[26:27] futures
[26:28] and
[26:30] i'm not repping them i'm not saying
[26:32] anything for you to go and open up an
[26:35] account with them
[26:36] but i have been asked
[26:38] are they a good broker
[26:41] i
[26:42] can only report the fact that he has not
[26:44] reported
[26:45] any issues with his fills being
[26:48] executed
[26:49] and done professionally
[26:51] the only issue there was was they
[26:53] weren't happy with the fact that i was
[26:55] sharing one of his statements that he
[26:57] emailed me
[26:58] and
[27:00] they asked him to ask me and me to take
[27:03] it down so i took it down
[27:05] but i can talk about the numbers okay so
[27:07] here's what he did he had a equity low
[27:10] of 2810
[27:12] and
[27:14] in a matter of a number of weeks until
[27:17] just at present
[27:19] he didn't do any trades today okay we
[27:22] were observing i was teaching i did
[27:24] trades myself
[27:25] but he was observing he's in this
[27:29] the position of
[27:30] spectating not speculating today because
[27:33] i wanted him to understand that the
[27:35] the large range day can creep in like it
[27:37] did in the afternoon
[27:39] and it may not look so clear in the
[27:41] morning but we were looking at it with
[27:42] that lens and i was showing that
[27:44] beforehand in the marketplace and in the
[27:46] commentary on twitter
[27:49] but he's at 18 300 plus
[27:53] so
[27:54] in the course of like four weeks
[27:56] you know that's about 400 return
[27:59] so that's in my opinion
[28:02] you know that's
[28:04] a remarkable growth
[28:06] that that
[28:07] shows obviously
[28:09] he knows what he's looking for he knows
[28:10] what he wants to do
[28:13] he wants to obviously grow his account
[28:15] he wants to build it up
[28:16] and not try to hit grand slam home runs
[28:20] and
[28:22] because he works at a
[28:23] low paying job
[28:25] it's real easy to hit that threshold
[28:27] that he earns on a weekly basis so
[28:31] when i sat down with him
[28:32] one of the things i felt was imperative
[28:36] was he has a very short
[28:38] attention span he's easily distracted so
[28:40] i wanted to give him a model that gave
[28:42] him a very low threshold for
[28:45] a
[28:46] return of points or pips and since we
[28:49] settled in on the index futures market
[28:52] for him
[28:53] it ignores
[28:55] the spread issues that are going to be a
[28:57] plague for
[28:59] traders that are using forex
[29:01] it's
[29:02] a professional market it's a very liquid
[29:04] market the e-mini s p
[29:07] and
[29:09] its
[29:11] systematic in the way it delivers price
[29:14] so if i can sit down with him
[29:17] i want to take him to the chart at a
[29:18] specific time of day
[29:20] with a specific logic in mind
[29:23] and then
[29:24] have him hopefully
[29:26] see a pattern that repeats it may not
[29:28] form that day he sits down then he has
[29:30] to
[29:31] just move to the sidelines and do
[29:32] nothing
[29:36] that
[29:37] choice
[29:38] to say i don't see it today
[29:41] and then if something forms after the
[29:44] charts get closed
[29:45] or
[29:46] if the trader moves away from the charts
[29:48] and they come back later on and they see
[29:49] it moved a certain way
[29:51] that fear of missing out
[29:54] you need to squash that quickly in the
[29:56] beginning and the only way you do that
[29:58] is by back testing and seeing how many
[30:00] times these things form
[30:01] so
[30:03] while we did that together
[30:07] because i'm his father and i'm literally
[30:09] next to him like i'm next to him
[30:12] giving him my experiences as close as i
[30:15] can possibly be
[30:18] next to doing it you know what i mean
[30:19] like i'm sitting here acting like the
[30:21] internal voice for him i'm saying okay
[30:23] what do you see here
[30:24] what do you see there what happens if
[30:26] you did this and what happens if you did
[30:27] that
[30:28] where would you think price is going to
[30:30] go so i'm literally being the internal
[30:31] dialogue
[30:33] that
[30:34] 30 years of experience would have
[30:36] spoke to him internally
[30:39] so
[30:40] he has that inside advantage okay that
[30:42] that
[30:43] that home field advantage if you will
[30:46] he's pushing the buttons obviously and
[30:48] if he elects to do nothing based on what
[30:50] i'm asking about in the chart
[30:52] sometimes the market moves he's not in
[30:54] it sometimes he does something and the
[30:56] market does something against him and he
[30:58] has that
[30:59] decision of
[31:01] do i let the stop loss get hit or do i
[31:04] just bail now and figure out what it is
[31:07] that i did wrong or what i'm
[31:09] uncomfortable about
[31:11] so
[31:12] it may not be the ideal learning
[31:14] conditions for everyone but i know
[31:17] where i'm leading him
[31:20] i need him to be prepared to obviously
[31:22] look for a specific element in price
[31:24] action and it's algorithmic okay i'm not
[31:26] sitting down with him with anything
[31:27] retail i'm not filling his head up with
[31:30] you know bull flags and bigger flags and
[31:32] when they fail
[31:34] because i teach my you know price action
[31:36] students to look for those types of
[31:37] things i'm not teaching him trend lines
[31:39] i'm not even bringing any of that stuff
[31:41] in i'm taking him right to the brass
[31:43] tacks of what it is that the algorithm
[31:46] is going to do
[31:47] because i only want him to be a
[31:48] one-trick pony
[31:50] right now that's all he needs to be able
[31:52] to feel confident to leave his job
[31:54] so i said i would teach it i said i
[31:56] would show it to you so i'm going to
[31:57] kind of give you the loose framework you
[31:59] know what it is that i try to teach him
[32:01] what he's looking for those types of
[32:02] elements
[32:04] but before i get into it
[32:06] i want to remind the viewers because
[32:08] this might be the first video you came
[32:10] across with my content
[32:13] so i want
[32:14] all of you and to be reminding those of
[32:17] you that have lost this in the
[32:19] conversation throughout these videos
[32:21] that price is delivered by an algorithm
[32:23] okay
[32:25] there is no buying and selling pressure
[32:27] that is something that they use as a
[32:30] excuse for what the market does
[32:32] and or doesn't do
[32:34] and algorithmic theory is based on time
[32:38] and price
[32:40] now
[32:42] time and price
[32:44] when i wrote this algorithm
[32:46] coding it
[32:48] leans heavily on the time element
[32:51] okay what what does that mean what time
[32:53] of day
[32:55] what day of week
[32:57] what week of month
[32:58] what month of year
[33:01] what seasonal influences so there's
[33:03] several factors i'm encoded in the
[33:05] algorithm that will seek these
[33:06] reoccurring phenomenon
[33:08] that can be capitalized on by those
[33:10] individuals that know what it is that
[33:11] they're
[33:12] hunting
[33:13] okay that little billboard that flashes
[33:16] uh hey it's time for you to engage now
[33:19] okay that signal that pattern that set
[33:21] up that framework whatever you want to
[33:22] call it
[33:23] the moment right before you push a
[33:25] button
[33:26] that's
[33:28] what i'm trying to take his attention
[33:29] into okay i'm taking all the other
[33:32] distractions away and i want him to go
[33:34] right in and look at that specific
[33:35] element
[33:37] price levels are useless until time is
[33:41] considered
[33:42] just because it's trading at your
[33:44] favorite price level this is the reason
[33:46] why support resistance is a fallacy
[33:49] there's many instances that anyone can
[33:51] go back in hindsight and say here is
[33:54] where this line
[33:55] worked and it repelled price up or down
[34:00] do it live
[34:02] consistently pick the right level
[34:05] consistently
[34:06] and that's the problem that retail
[34:08] traders have i went through that same
[34:10] thing
[34:10] i couldn't pick the right support
[34:12] resistance level even the higher time
[34:14] frame ones because
[34:15] sometimes you'll have a move
[34:18] where it'll go up hit a level that would
[34:20] be otherwise viewed as resistance
[34:23] and then it starts to go down and then
[34:24] it goes one more time up higher higher
[34:26] and then higher high takes my stop and
[34:27] then i'm afraid to go back in and go
[34:29] short right you've all experienced that
[34:31] i did the same stuff in the 90s
[34:33] 1992 1993 1994
[34:36] all those types of
[34:38] fearful events of getting stopped out
[34:40] and then abandoning my opinion about
[34:42] what i thought the market was going to
[34:43] do
[34:44] and instead of saying okay
[34:47] the framework's still valid i just had
[34:48] the entry wrong let me go back in with
[34:50] less risk this time
[34:52] less leverage this time
[34:54] and see if it pans out
[34:56] but like most of you and everybody else
[34:59] those stop out events create fear and
[35:03] anxiety and uncertainty
[35:07] so
[35:08] that's why
[35:10] time has to be considered first
[35:12] because the algorithm is going to start
[35:14] working a specific macro that means a
[35:17] short order of things that it will do as
[35:19] instructions
[35:20] it's going to seek a specific level move
[35:23] to a premium move to a discount
[35:26] suddenly move or
[35:28] consolidate and wait for another time
[35:31] element in that same trading day or
[35:33] trading week
[35:35] or month
[35:36] okay so that's the reason why
[35:39] i i'm teaching you that that element of
[35:41] time is crucial
[35:44] your inability to know
[35:46] everything that there is to know about
[35:48] time
[35:50] is going to be the area where it which
[35:53] you
[35:54] will have the largest growth in
[35:57] but you'll have the initial
[35:59] adversities
[36:01] when
[36:01] when when when when to do this when to
[36:03] do that
[36:05] when
[36:07] going through the motions of what it is
[36:08] i'm teaching you
[36:10] it'll happen for you that you understand
[36:12] why certain things are occurring at a
[36:14] specific time
[36:16] and i can't articulate it any better
[36:18] than that it's just a matter of
[36:20] doing it
[36:21] sitting with me every week
[36:23] looking at what is i'm trying to share
[36:25] taking your attention to a specific
[36:26] price level
[36:28] over time
[36:29] your your eyesight
[36:31] your understanding
[36:32] the visibility
[36:35] the perception of price
[36:37] will be dialed in you'll know what it is
[36:39] i'm doing
[36:40] because you've done it with me for days
[36:43] weeks and months okay
[36:47] time is of no use unless price is at a
[36:49] key pd array
[36:51] okay just because it's time for you to
[36:53] be able to sit in front of the charts
[36:55] it doesn't mean anything
[36:57] unless it's at a tpd array
[36:59] so in other words
[37:01] blending the two
[37:02] yields astonishing results and the
[37:04] precision that i share with you i've
[37:06] done
[37:08] a plethora of examples proving precision
[37:11] proving
[37:12] prognostication forecasting
[37:14] objectives targets the whole business
[37:16] okay
[37:21] it's not my aim or goal to try to do
[37:23] magic tricks for you
[37:25] okay
[37:26] i i don't want to be out here trying to
[37:27] be david copperfield of the markets and
[37:29] say here watch this
[37:30] sleight of hand and are you amazed by
[37:32] that are you amazed
[37:33] my task is i'm making you a wizard
[37:38] okay i'm teaching you the craft
[37:40] i'm not up here performing for you i try
[37:43] to make it as engaging as i can
[37:45] to keep the attention span on those that
[37:47] are very limited
[37:48] and bored easily i try to
[37:51] you know get their attention quick with
[37:52] little things that will draw their
[37:54] attention
[37:56] and hopefully keep them engaged long
[37:57] enough for the effects of learning
[38:00] properly
[38:01] to take
[38:02] root so
[38:05] if you look at this price action that's
[38:06] been staring at you
[38:09] does anything stand out on this chart
[38:12] if you're a new student to price action
[38:14] or if you're a new student to me
[38:16] a lot of these things that you're
[38:17] looking at here in terms of the price
[38:19] action
[38:20] all the movements and such
[38:22] it looks like a foreign language you've
[38:24] never learned how to read
[38:26] well if you're looking at price action
[38:27] like this it looks
[38:29] like it has no reason for doing what
[38:31] it's doing
[38:32] it's completely random
[38:35] and one of the fun things i get the
[38:37] experience as a mentor with the insight
[38:39] that i have
[38:41] being in a position where i have done a
[38:42] lot of the
[38:44] producing
[38:45] of these things
[38:47] and the authorship of it
[38:49] i get the benefit and pleasure of
[38:50] watching people
[38:52] get blown away by
[38:55] the incredible detail
[38:57] that this algorithm repeats and follows
[39:00] if we take
[39:02] all of the noise away from just
[39:05] all this back and forth movement
[39:08] and we add
[39:09] just a little bit of lipstick
[39:16] suddenly we have a lot more to work with
[39:20] what's the first element to algorithmic
[39:22] theory
[39:24] price
[39:25] or time
[39:28] time
[39:29] so time
[39:30] begins in the morning session for us as
[39:32] a
[39:33] index futures trader
[39:35] at 8 30. that's when the news embargo
[39:37] lifts that means at 8 30 that's when
[39:38] there's usually a news event or some
[39:40] kind of economic report that comes out
[39:42] at 8 30 new york local time
[39:44] so that's the reason why i tell you to
[39:45] set your clocks
[39:47] on your trading view platform
[39:50] here to the local time in new york
[39:56] this candle right here is the 8 30
[39:57] candle in new york time
[40:03] this morning i outlined how i felt that
[40:05] we would likely see the market move
[40:08] to a
[40:10] liquidity pool a specific liquidity pool
[40:13] and it would draw down
[40:15] and attack the sell side
[40:19] i teach my son to look for
[40:22] setups that are going to target a
[40:23] specific pool of liquidity
[40:26] it means i have to have
[40:28] a clear
[40:30] idea where the market's likely to go up
[40:33] for buy side or down for sell side
[40:37] i'm not trading a support and resistance
[40:38] idea i'm not looking to go to a level to
[40:40] watch it repel away that's not what i'm
[40:42] doing
[40:43] that's a fallacy that's the reason why
[40:45] retail traders
[40:47] drop the ball so many times and or blow
[40:49] their accounts and never find
[40:50] consistency because they're trying to
[40:52] force something that is designed to fail
[40:55] i don't know why it's so hard for people
[40:57] to acknowledge
[40:58] when they
[41:00] are met with extreme adversities trying
[41:02] to force retail logic to work can you
[41:06] make money with retail concepts yes
[41:09] yes you can if you understand how to
[41:12] reprice like i'm teaching it if you did
[41:14] those types of things
[41:16] without understanding why the market
[41:18] should do what it's doing why is price
[41:20] booking the way it is
[41:21] what does that mean why is price going
[41:23] to these specific levels at the time
[41:24] it's doing it
[41:26] there's a logic behind that
[41:29] and for some that want to say
[41:32] there is no technical science
[41:35] you know at some point you know
[41:37] when does it stop becoming useful all of
[41:39] it's useful
[41:42] every tiny minute little fluctuation in
[41:44] these price movements
[41:46] are absolutely controlled engineered and
[41:49] premeditated
[41:51] either
[41:52] by ai
[41:54] artificial intelligence that's the
[41:55] algorithm it's following the code that's
[41:58] been written for it
[42:00] or
[42:01] there are times when manual intervention
[42:03] comes in and they will send price to a
[42:05] specific price level sometimes it's
[42:07] going to be abrupt
[42:09] and
[42:10] aggressive and it may not be fun or
[42:12] pleasurable being a part of that move
[42:14] other times it will be exhilarating
[42:16] because you were on the right side
[42:19] when those
[42:21] moments of
[42:22] intervention occur that's a manual
[42:24] intervention that means someone is
[42:26] literally going in and manipulating
[42:28] price to do a specific thing what would
[42:30] that be like
[42:32] fomc
[42:34] a rate announcement something to that
[42:35] effect
[42:36] and the market will reprice aggressively
[42:39] quickly to a
[42:40] price that's well outside
[42:43] the scope that would be reasonably
[42:44] expected for that short term
[42:46] perspective
[42:48] big explosive price movement
[42:52] the economic calendar is useful in that
[42:54] respect because you can go in and see
[42:57] where these events are likely to form
[43:00] so i'm looking for days
[43:02] in my son's model where he can go in
[43:06] and engage price
[43:08] when there is a medium or high impact
[43:10] news event
[43:12] or
[43:14] if there is a lack of one
[43:16] he can practice but he shouldn't be
[43:19] engaging with his normal risk percentage
[43:22] okay
[43:24] so the first element is time
[43:28] so at 8 30 in the morning that's when a
[43:30] news embargo lists that's the first
[43:31] element of time that i taught you with
[43:32] this model
[43:34] the second one is 9 30.
[43:36] okay that's right here
[43:38] the first here
[43:40] at midnight new york local time that
[43:42] opening price is here
[43:45] did the market rally above that opening
[43:47] price
[43:48] at 8 30
[43:49] yes
[43:52] are we bearish i proved this morning i
[43:54] was expecting lower prices i preferred
[43:56] lower prices
[43:58] so that means we're above the opening
[43:59] price at midnight so my power 3 concept
[44:01] is
[44:02] you want to be shorting at or above the
[44:04] opening price at midnight in new york
[44:06] local time if you're trying to capture
[44:08] movement on the daily range
[44:11] on a down day
[44:13] so
[44:14] that opening price look what happens we
[44:17] run up
[44:18] take out short-term highs
[44:20] here
[44:21] that's a short-term run on liquidity
[44:23] who's going to have stops at that one
[44:24] minute
[44:25] anybody that would have put a stop loss
[44:27] in on these lower time frames there's
[44:28] traders that are doing that all the time
[44:31] the algorithm is not aware of how much
[44:33] volume rests above or below
[44:37] a high or low that's
[44:39] penetrated it has no
[44:41] understanding of that
[44:43] it doesn't need it
[44:47] for folks that are
[44:49] perplexed by that statement and i've
[44:51] said it several times in the past
[44:54] ever play a video game
[44:57] how about pac-man i'm a child of the 70s
[45:00] i was born 1972
[45:02] august 8th 7 11 p.m
[45:05] see that 7 11. lucky 7-eleven
[45:08] i came in the world with some luck
[45:10] didn't i
[45:12] so
[45:14] when you're looking at a game like
[45:15] pac-man okay what keeps pac-man
[45:21] inside the boundaries of those lines
[45:23] that make up the maze that it runs
[45:25] around and collects and eats those dots
[45:26] until it gets to a power dot or
[45:28] chased down and killed by the ghosts
[45:31] the program language keeps him limited
[45:34] the play board or game maze
[45:37] has limitations
[45:39] those limitations are programmed
[45:42] as such
[45:43] every video game today they have a map
[45:46] okay fortnite
[45:48] call of duty
[45:50] battlefield
[45:52] all that
[45:55] genre of video game
[45:57] creation
[45:58] all those maps or territories that the
[46:02] player gets to enjoy and explore they
[46:05] have limitations
[46:06] okay
[46:08] the daily range has those limitations
[46:10] programmed into it as well
[46:13] until
[46:14] manual intervention is brought in and
[46:17] those
[46:18] initial boundaries are removed
[46:20] okay so think of price like that
[46:23] so
[46:24] if you know that we're likely to see
[46:26] that in terms of like an analogy we're
[46:30] at at 8 30 we're above the opening price
[46:32] at midnight we ran a short term high
[46:34] here
[46:36] the algorithm doesn't care how many
[46:37] orders we're above that it doesn't care
[46:40] it just has to take out a short term
[46:41] high it does so it's at a premium it
[46:44] took out buy side so what is it likely
[46:46] to do now because we're in a bearish day
[46:47] and we're above the opening price and
[46:48] it's at 8 30.
[46:50] reprice for what
[46:52] sell side where sell side
[46:54] this level down here
[46:56] 4101
[46:59] or what 4100 big figure 4100
[47:03] level
[47:04] so there's liquidity resting below that
[47:06] what kind of liquidity if markets
[47:08] price is here
[47:11] and
[47:12] sell side is here it's old lows
[47:15] there's sell side below that so market
[47:17] price is here
[47:18] relative equal lows
[47:20] in the past
[47:21] is this level here
[47:23] go back in the beginning the video okay
[47:24] you don't understand what that level is
[47:25] then
[47:27] that liquidity
[47:28] is sell side we're at a premium here
[47:31] this would be a discount because market
[47:32] price is here or here
[47:34] anything below is what discount
[47:37] so
[47:39] the algorithm goes from buy side
[47:40] liquidity at 8 30 on a bearish day above
[47:43] the opening price
[47:44] wait for the market to trade lower it
[47:46] does
[47:48] short term low
[47:49] see that swing low trades through it
[47:52] creates a fair value gap
[47:54] rally back up to it
[47:56] sell short with the expectation is going
[47:57] to run to sell liquidity this is what
[47:59] i'm teaching my son to do at 8 30.
[48:03] that's all he's trying to capture there
[48:06] in this move
[48:08] he may not run all the way to the sell
[48:11] side
[48:12] he's going to get his five points
[48:15] once he does he's stopping
[48:18] he gets out and then he watches the move
[48:21] go to the sell side of cody pool
[48:24] why am i telling him to get out five
[48:25] points number one five points is very
[48:27] very easy i think that that is the
[48:29] lowest threshold
[48:32] of points a setup should hopefully yield
[48:35] if you're trying to do anything less
[48:37] than that
[48:38] you're doing ultra short-term scalping
[48:41] and the commission costs will kill you
[48:43] it ain't worth doing and
[48:45] i think five points is an easy threshold
[48:47] you can do it once in the morning you
[48:48] can do it once in afternoon even on a
[48:50] really weird choppy day
[48:53] you could
[48:53] reasonably pull out five points if you
[48:55] have the experience
[48:57] you don't have that experience yet
[48:59] so let me put that in your mind right
[49:01] now because i don't want you thinking
[49:02] well i'm going to go out there tomorrow
[49:03] and do what i see you said i've only
[49:04] been trading for a week so i think he's
[49:07] really convinced me and i can pull this
[49:08] off and it's going to be ten points a
[49:10] day for me five in the morning five in
[49:11] the afternoon this is gonna be cakewalk
[49:12] i'm not sure this put in my two weeks
[49:13] into this now until the boss pound sand
[49:16] no
[49:18] no no no don't do that you're not ready
[49:20] but if that's a goal for you start
[49:22] working towards it
[49:25] so
[49:26] over time my expectation is that my son
[49:29] will have a better understanding what
[49:31] he's doing and those five points he'll
[49:34] have
[49:35] hopefully learn to take a portion off at
[49:38] five points and then hold
[49:41] for that liquidity pool to be hit and
[49:43] because of doing that very thing he's
[49:46] rewarding himself initially while he's
[49:47] learning so he engages him it shows that
[49:50] he can make more money doing this than
[49:52] his job
[49:53] okay that does not mean that you can do
[49:55] more than your job i'm saying this is my
[49:57] son he has me as his father i'm sitting
[50:00] with him i'm coaching him i'm telling
[50:02] him what he should be focusing on i'm
[50:05] questioning why he isn't focusing on
[50:06] other things so i'm actually
[50:09] like co-piloting him you know i'm giving
[50:12] him you know
[50:15] visual and
[50:16] audible clues as to what he should be
[50:19] using to navigate price
[50:22] so don't think for a moment folks that
[50:24] he sat down you know and did like a
[50:27] couple days of talks with daddy and now
[50:29] he's out there making 400 gains from
[50:31] ezekiel up to where it is now that that
[50:33] is not what took place okay
[50:36] he has the benefit of me sitting with
[50:39] him talking to him okay
[50:42] much in the same vein that i did with
[50:43] you all this morning on twitter where i
[50:46] said this is what i'm looking at these
[50:48] are the levels i'm looking for if this
[50:49] breaks i think we're going down to that
[50:51] level i'm doing that on a
[50:53] minute-by-minute basis with caleb
[50:56] so he's
[50:57] literally
[50:59] driving a car with me talking about
[51:01] every pothole
[51:03] every potential hazard that's coming
[51:05] i'm reading the mind of all the drivers
[51:07] around us and telling him what they're
[51:08] going to do before they do it
[51:10] so it's it's
[51:11] it's a totally immersive experience for
[51:14] him
[51:15] and
[51:16] admittedly it's
[51:18] a little intimidating for him it's too
[51:19] much at some times and we have to repeat
[51:22] certain things or he gets confused or
[51:24] he's apprehensive or reluctant to do
[51:27] something or he second guesses something
[51:29] so you know all those types of things
[51:31] that any human being would have
[51:33] you know with dad's expectation to learn
[51:36] how to do this
[51:38] and also you're dealing with real money
[51:41] so
[51:42] i'm teaching him to respect
[51:45] what to do and when it's wrong he feels
[51:48] it
[51:50] it's not a matter of
[51:51] well you know i can reset a demo account
[51:53] no this is real money
[51:55] so when he sees the money going up in
[51:58] his account he feels that
[52:00] good feeling
[52:01] if he has entered a trade and it's
[52:04] drawing down on him he's feeling that
[52:07] now i know what i'm looking at i know
[52:09] what i'm
[52:10] expecting he doesn't so i'm allowing him
[52:13] to experience those things but five
[52:15] points i think is a reasonable low
[52:17] threshold
[52:19] over time he will
[52:21] by default learn to trade with more than
[52:23] five points but i gotta give him
[52:25] something to hit that it's easy that
[52:27] low-hanging fruit
[52:29] approach that's how i teach
[52:30] just like i taught on baby pips when i
[52:32] first came out
[52:33] 25 pips a week
[52:35] you should be aiming for that and when
[52:36] you get it stop
[52:38] does that mean when you're trading 10
[52:39] years from now that's all you're gonna
[52:40] do no
[52:42] people that have been highly critical of
[52:44] me they like to take the things i say
[52:46] out of context and make a straw man
[52:47] argument about it and they have no idea
[52:49] what i'm
[52:50] doing with the new student i'm targeting
[52:52] a audience that is trying to do
[52:55] something that's going to give them
[52:57] encouragement feel like they're they're
[52:59] progressing
[53:00] and
[53:02] don't think for a moment that five
[53:04] points just once a day isn't good
[53:05] because you could literally
[53:07] do very very well think about it this
[53:09] way
[53:10] if you just did five points in the email
[53:12] asap one contract and never engaged
[53:15] money management to the degree where you
[53:17] start parlaying it up and start doing
[53:20] two contracts and then two contracts
[53:21] becomes four contracts eventually and
[53:23] then eventually you treat me if you just
[53:25] did one contract
[53:26] okay so calm down for a second and just
[53:29] listen to me for a moment
[53:31] if you just did one contract
[53:33] of the mini
[53:35] s p that means one point
[53:37] in your favor or against you is worth
[53:40] fifty dollars now fifty dollars
[53:44] times five
[53:45] that's 250 dollars a day
[53:48] if you did that consistently
[53:51] once every single day
[53:54] that's 25 handles or points a week
[53:59] that's 1250 a week
[54:02] i'm quite certain after polling my
[54:05] audience
[54:06] on twitter which isn't my entire
[54:09] audience obviously i have a lot of
[54:10] people there's a lot of people that
[54:11] actually leave comments on my video on
[54:13] youtube
[54:14] that i can see that they're a subscriber
[54:17] and i can also see the comments that are
[54:19] left by subscribers
[54:21] usually
[54:22] i answer the questions that people
[54:25] present to me if they're a subscriber
[54:27] because it's kind of like a little perk
[54:28] because i
[54:31] i have like a goal
[54:34] i want a million subscribers i'm going
[54:35] to lie to you i want to have a million
[54:36] subscribers on this channel and
[54:39] i'm surprised and
[54:40] really honored and
[54:42] humbled that so many of you
[54:45] subscribed to this channel and i mean
[54:46] 260
[54:47] some viewers i thought by the end of the
[54:49] year i could have had 250 000 but now
[54:51] you know i'm almost
[54:53] you know
[54:54] on my way to
[54:55] 300 000 before i know it you know this
[54:57] this channel could be in a year or two
[55:00] at my goal of a million subscribers
[55:03] but
[55:04] folks that follow me and they leave
[55:05] comments
[55:06] if it's a comment that i want to address
[55:09] i usually will respond to those that
[55:10] have that little mark next to their name
[55:12] you can't really see it but i can
[55:13] because it's the
[55:14] channel i'm the owner of the channel so
[55:16] i can see who's commenting with a
[55:19] follow
[55:20] and if you follow me
[55:22] i appreciate that i thank you for that
[55:24] but
[55:27] i don't want
[55:28] any of you to
[55:31] think that you're going to make five
[55:32] points every single day
[55:34] for instance
[55:36] i took a loss of five points yesterday i
[55:38] could have easily went back in and made
[55:40] four times that later in the afternoon
[55:43] but
[55:44] that's just me
[55:46] you
[55:47] don't have that skill set in confidence
[55:49] yet that okay if you take a loss and you
[55:50] took five points as a draw down
[55:54] you're going to want to go back in and
[55:55] do it right away whereas i can and i
[55:56] chose not to
[55:59] because i want you to feel like okay
[56:01] it's okay
[56:02] and i even proved that i can call a move
[56:04] even in the afternoon
[56:06] i said this is where it's going to go
[56:08] i'm pointing to a specific level and
[56:10] went to it
[56:11] i said that we would run out the lows
[56:12] and we would break a trend line that
[56:14] retail thinks is
[56:16] you know noteworthy and they destroyed
[56:19] it
[56:20] go back and look at the comments on
[56:21] twitter i don't delete a single tweet
[56:23] zero
[56:25] so
[56:26] i'm laying breadcrumbs down for you but
[56:28] i'm not going to spoon feed you you're
[56:30] going to earn it here and that makes
[56:32] some of you angry it frustrates some of
[56:34] you
[56:35] and
[56:36] no amount of frustrated replies to me or
[56:40] you know
[56:41] pointed statements
[56:44] are gonna is gonna make me change the
[56:46] way i do it
[56:47] because
[56:49] once you earn this skill set you will
[56:51] not
[56:52] regret what you went through to get it
[56:54] and you will treasure it you'll
[56:56] appreciate it
[56:58] it's not like reading a book that
[57:00] teaches you a magic trick and then you
[57:01] want to go around telling everybody how
[57:02] to do the magic trick versus getting
[57:04] good at doing the magic trick
[57:06] there's a difference there okay
[57:08] so
[57:09] what i teach my son to do is at 8 30 he
[57:12] looks for a setup like this if it's if
[57:14] it's a bear scenario he's looking for
[57:16] liquidity below the marketplace
[57:18] and he's looking for some type of
[57:20] framework where it gives a fair value
[57:21] gap that is his pattern that's what he
[57:24] settled in on
[57:25] and
[57:26] we're gonna run to liquidity and if it
[57:28] gives him five points he's out even if
[57:30] the framework allows for 30
[57:32] points
[57:33] he's getting out at five
[57:35] now i already know some of you hot shots
[57:37] has been doing it for a while or like to
[57:38] be critical or troll me and you just run
[57:41] your mouth
[57:42] oh this guy
[57:44] he's telling his son it could move 30
[57:46] points but he's getting out at five
[57:47] points who does that someone that's
[57:49] never traded live money before that's
[57:51] who's doing it okay someone that's
[57:53] already made 400 some percent
[57:55] in one month
[57:57] that's who's doing it okay
[57:59] someone that hasn't had a losing day
[58:02] in weeks
[58:03] that's who's doing it
[58:05] so sit down take notes or move along
[58:11] in the afternoon
[58:12] there's a setup as well we'll get into
[58:14] that in a moment but the next area of
[58:16] opportunity
[58:17] is the 9 30 hour
[58:19] okay so equity is open at 9 30
[58:22] and this is one i outlined
[58:25] the market was down here
[58:27] i mentioned on twitter i said okay they
[58:29] opened it up at 9 30
[58:32] initially started sending it lower
[58:34] and we'll talk about that in a couple
[58:35] minutes of what that was and
[58:38] what information could be gleaned from
[58:39] that but i said that
[58:41] they're going to take price up into the
[58:42] fair value gap
[58:45] and also clear
[58:46] 4105.
[58:48] it's all time and date stamped folks you
[58:50] can go back on twitter
[58:51] take a look at it it's there
[58:53] it's undeniable it's not ambiguous it's
[58:55] very specific
[58:57] look at the time on your chart
[58:59] it's here
[59:01] i'm saying it 4105 that's where the buy
[59:04] side liquidity is that's where the stops
[59:06] are and it's a fair value gap there it's
[59:07] going to reprice there and then you're
[59:09] gonna see the move the real move for the
[59:11] day
[59:13] market drops from there i went short on
[59:15] a demo account
[59:17] and as price went below this low i
[59:19] tweeted first go back and look at the
[59:21] little recording okay i'm not in here
[59:24] because there's people already going
[59:25] around in other forums and other social
[59:28] media saying i'm trying to pump and dump
[59:32] because they don't have a big audience
[59:33] they think i'm going to go out there and
[59:35] say something hopefully create some kind
[59:37] of movement in the marketplace and then
[59:39] i'm going to get out before i say i'm
[59:40] getting out
[59:42] no
[59:43] i literally record myself saying
[59:46] pay the trader
[59:48] and then i go in and i take my partial
[59:49] as it goes below here go and watch the
[59:51] video
[59:52] so i'm not doing any of those types of
[59:54] things folks okay
[59:56] i'm going to be
[60:00] your
[60:01] best friend
[60:02] i'm gonna be the best friend you could
[60:04] ever have in these markets if you just
[60:07] simply relax and trust me
[60:10] i'm here to help you
[60:12] i'm not here to ask anything of you
[60:14] except for subscribe you know that's
[60:16] like a trophy for me if i get a million
[60:18] subscribers i want to have that
[60:20] i'll put the work in to earn it
[60:22] but
[60:23] i'm not asking you to pay for anything
[60:25] i'm not asking you
[60:27] to worship me and cheer my name and all
[60:29] that stuff none of that i just want you
[60:31] to have fun to hang out with me
[60:33] that's it because i promise if you do if
[60:35] you put the work into this stuff
[60:37] and hang out every single day show up
[60:39] every single day even if you don't
[60:40] understand it if you feel like you got
[60:42] confused about what it is i'm doing
[60:44] keep showing up
[60:46] every single day that discipline will
[60:48] yield results each one of you gonna have
[60:51] a different
[60:53] timeline is when you're gonna get it
[60:55] i don't have a deadline i don't have a
[60:57] i'm stopping when it gets this date
[60:59] i'm here now okay
[61:01] i'm enjoying myself i'm having fun and
[61:03] hopefully you guys are having fun too
[61:05] but this setup here eventually came back
[61:08] and ran back above the short-term high
[61:10] and ran here
[61:12] so we went one more time where above the
[61:14] new york midnight opening price
[61:16] so we're at a premium and above the
[61:18] opening price at midnight
[61:20] and consolidates in here and then it
[61:22] breaks down and later on in the
[61:24] afternoon we'll see what it does
[61:30] now if you watch the video
[61:33] you can see that i actually entered in
[61:34] here went short i was aiming for this i
[61:36] had
[61:37] a
[61:38] objective of taking two contracts off
[61:40] here
[61:41] so
[61:43] it went below that i tweeted take
[61:45] partials or pay the trader first then i
[61:47] went into my demo account and closed out
[61:50] the two as it went below that low
[61:52] so i was managing
[61:54] your expectations i was showing you what
[61:56] to do with your demo account if you were
[61:58] doing anything and engaging and then i
[62:00] did my version of it so i was given the
[62:03] instructions first
[62:04] and then when the market started going
[62:07] up
[62:07] i outlined this order block here it
[62:10] started to repel away from that i
[62:11] actually mentioned i wanted to see price
[62:12] stay below this level here all i did was
[62:15] extend this and then mentioned that uber
[62:18] taken order block here was problematic
[62:21] i had anticipated if you watch on there
[62:24] in that short term video
[62:26] i had pulled up the
[62:29] partial close of three more contracts
[62:31] and my stop i hadn't moved except for
[62:34] moving the break even a little bit
[62:36] better than break even after i took the
[62:37] partial here
[62:39] and then once it went above this order
[62:41] block here that's when i closed three
[62:43] more contracts before the stop also hit
[62:45] now i could have closed the entire order
[62:47] but to me that would feel like panic
[62:49] okay
[62:50] i don't mind a stop loss getting hit
[62:51] because that's teaching you
[62:54] that's
[62:55] what they're paid to do you're paying a
[62:57] stop loss to do its job
[62:59] i'm not worrying about price going
[63:01] higher than my stop loss
[63:03] but if i have an ability to take
[63:05] something off before the stop is going
[63:06] to go there and maybe maybe it goes
[63:09] close to the stop loss and it doesn't
[63:10] hit it
[63:12] i've taken something off which was that
[63:13] initial
[63:14] partial here plus three more contracts
[63:16] and i had a remaining three contracts
[63:18] that got stopped out better than even
[63:21] so
[63:22] i didn't scratch on any position
[63:24] i didn't take in my opinion large enough
[63:26] position off
[63:28] down here in retrospect but
[63:30] that's how it's going to be for you
[63:32] now the question is going to be this
[63:35] why did i pick this candle
[63:37] why was i concerned about it when it
[63:39] went above it
[63:41] and why did i close
[63:42] the three contracts
[63:44] when it went above that how did i know
[63:46] it was reversing basically what you're
[63:47] asking
[63:49] now
[63:50] if you look at this sell side liquidity
[63:52] pool we have outlined here that was
[63:54] explained on twitter it's also been
[63:56] shown on this video here at the
[63:58] beginning of the video so if you look at
[63:59] the liquidity up here the old lows we
[64:02] went below that so south side's been
[64:03] tapped here
[64:05] then it went lower and created a
[64:06] relative equal lows here creating what
[64:08] another level of sell side below that
[64:12] went below that
[64:13] so we now have another low formed here
[64:16] what's resting below that sell side
[64:18] people are always trying to buy lows
[64:19] they're trying to pick bottoms
[64:21] so the sell side gets taken once more
[64:23] here
[64:24] and then
[64:25] this low gets taken here so notice
[64:27] what's occurring
[64:30] we went below cell side here here
[64:32] here
[64:33] here here and here
[64:36] without moving very much
[64:39] notice that
[64:41] so
[64:42] after we've taken buy side liquidity
[64:44] here
[64:45] it should have been off the races and
[64:46] went lower
[64:48] and this should have capped price on the
[64:49] upside because it's an up-close candle
[64:51] institutional overflow my rules for
[64:53] teaching that to you is if we're bearish
[64:56] and overflow is bearish
[64:58] this should have stopped price like it
[65:00] did here it should have maybe touched it
[65:01] one more time here or just bumped above
[65:03] that short-term high and then went
[65:05] aggressively lower it did not do that
[65:07] that's why if you watch the video of me
[65:09] actually doing the trade
[65:10] i actually pull up the order to take
[65:11] three off because i'm watching to see if
[65:13] this is going to fail
[65:15] because it didn't tear off and take that
[65:17] low out
[65:19] because it was reaching back up in this
[65:21] order block and then started going into
[65:22] it i knew i was going to get smoked on
[65:24] the stop
[65:25] so it would be easier for me to just
[65:26] take partial
[65:28] three off which i had pulled up on my
[65:30] chart ready to go versus just clicking
[65:33] the
[65:34] closing the entire trade which in my
[65:36] opinion
[65:37] wouldn't be as
[65:39] instructional for you
[65:41] because i want to show you how you can
[65:43] still many times take something off
[65:45] again and it might not hit your
[65:46] stop-loss and then it resumes going in
[65:48] your favor and hopefully you can add
[65:49] those three contracts or whatever the
[65:51] portion would have been if you had taken
[65:53] the trade put them back on at it you
[65:55] know as a pyramiding type thing
[65:57] but because we took this up close candle
[66:00] out that was problematic because we had
[66:02] multiple levels of sell side taken below
[66:04] the original sell side liquidity that
[66:06] was
[66:07] outlined in the beginning of the day on
[66:08] twitter
[66:09] so in short what should have happened
[66:12] was
[66:13] we ran the buy side here
[66:15] that should have been the high of the
[66:16] day and then it broke lower but because
[66:18] it took out this candle here
[66:20] after taking multiple levels of cell
[66:22] side what's the algorithm going to do
[66:24] seek by side where is it now above this
[66:26] high here
[66:28] so it's doing that run up here and then
[66:30] back above midnight opening handle
[66:33] price
[66:34] at opening new york local time at
[66:36] midnight
[66:42] and in the afternoon
[66:44] if my son has taken a trade in the
[66:47] morning
[66:48] and was profitable he'll do another
[66:50] trade in the afternoon
[66:52] he's aiming for either 8 30 or 9 30 for
[66:54] his morning session move if he gets his
[66:56] five points at 8 30 he won't trade at 9
[66:58] 30. if he misses something at 8 30 he'll
[67:00] try at 9 30.
[67:02] either or he's trying to do one time in
[67:05] the morning now he can take a a loss at
[67:07] 8 30 then he can try to make it back
[67:09] with the 9 30 set up
[67:12] if he misses the 9 30 setup or takes a
[67:14] loss in the morning
[67:16] he can trade the afternoon
[67:18] if he makes money in the morning i tell
[67:20] him paper trade or demo trade the
[67:23] afternoon
[67:24] okay
[67:25] why
[67:26] why not push your edge if you have an
[67:28] edge ict if your son's so good and he's
[67:30] doing what he's being taught to do
[67:32] why shouldn't he be trading every
[67:34] session move because i'm not teaching
[67:35] him to be greedy i'm teaching him
[67:37] discipline
[67:38] because if he can see that he can make
[67:41] more and chooses not to do it
[67:43] there's a certain measure of
[67:46] confidence
[67:48] assurity
[67:53] contentment
[67:54] knowing that
[67:57] you can go in these markets anytime and
[67:59] get it
[68:00] and that
[68:02] fact that understanding that realization
[68:06] is a piece of mind that keeps
[68:09] me from going in and over trading it
[68:10] keeps me from going in and doing more
[68:13] than it's necessary and it never allows
[68:15] me to fear and keeps me from ever
[68:17] fearing that these things are going to
[68:18] stop working
[68:20] like i understand that i get lots of new
[68:23] students
[68:24] and they see what i'm doing and they're
[68:26] afraid that all these people that are
[68:27] following me are somehow going to break
[68:30] the market because they're all doing the
[68:31] same thing
[68:33] no
[68:35] because you're going to find setups that
[68:36] are going to be different than i'm
[68:38] entering and i can do a lot other things
[68:40] that aren't even in charts
[68:42] so i'm not worried about
[68:44] these things failing because i taught
[68:45] more people to deal because
[68:47] if you look at the folks on my twitter
[68:49] feed that are just you know subscribing
[68:51] to me and they're looking at everything
[68:53] i say and they think that's a code word
[68:55] for take a butt or take a sell and
[68:58] that's they're rushing in to take a
[69:00] trade they need to be slowing down
[69:03] there's always going to be people out
[69:04] there that just because they're being
[69:05] exposed to this content they're not
[69:07] going to be disciplined enough and
[69:08] they're going to be people that come to
[69:09] this youtube channel
[69:11] and they are watching these videos and
[69:13] they're studying the concepts and
[69:14] they're never going to make it work for
[69:16] themselves not because they don't work
[69:17] but because they're doing things with
[69:19] them
[69:20] in an undisciplined manner
[69:23] they're doing things willy-nilly they're
[69:24] trying to
[69:26] you know recreate the wheel because they
[69:27] want to be able to say they did
[69:29] something
[69:30] they made something they created it it's
[69:32] their authorship it's their concept it's
[69:34] their thing their model their
[69:36] approach to
[69:38] what they learned from me
[69:40] because it's clout
[69:42] they want cloud clout is the thing
[69:43] everybody wants right now clicking the
[69:45] buttons watch my videos come to my
[69:47] channel you know that type of thing
[69:48] attention to me
[69:50] and
[69:51] those types of people aren't going to be
[69:54] the successful ones the ones that don't
[69:55] care about being looked at or cared to
[69:57] be followed
[69:59] they're going to be probably the best
[70:01] out of the entire
[70:02] fold here
[70:04] because that's how it is in my private
[70:05] group the ones that are the most quiet
[70:07] they're the ones that are doing it the
[70:09] best
[70:10] they're not trying to make an image on
[70:11] themselves they only care about the
[70:13] results and their results are
[70:14] significant enough for them
[70:16] not to look for outward
[70:18] you know
[70:20] approval
[70:22] but in the afternoon
[70:23] what was the time i taught you
[70:26] in this
[70:27] mentorship when is the afternoon session
[70:30] for pm session trading in index futures
[70:34] after lunch but specifically what time
[70:37] 1 30. so at 1 30
[70:41] right here we're leaving an area of buy
[70:43] stocks that have been taken it's
[70:44] breaking down then the market returns
[70:46] back to a bearish breaker there then it
[70:49] starts to go lower we have displacement
[70:51] here
[70:53] that could have been an entry there
[70:56] once more low taken here and now we have
[70:59] wealth of equal lows
[71:01] they are broken there see that this is
[71:04] what i'm training my son to see
[71:06] this is a valid setup
[71:08] but i'm looking for these types of
[71:09] things for him because look what this is
[71:11] this low this low and this low what's
[71:13] resting below that
[71:15] sell side liquidity
[71:16] on a bearish day so does it want to
[71:19] drive down into that it does
[71:21] does it create an imbalance there it
[71:23] does
[71:24] does it trade back up into it yes
[71:26] that's where he's going to be selling
[71:28] short
[71:29] and he's looking for his five points
[71:31] and then he's watching and studying does
[71:33] it go to that 40-70 level that i was
[71:35] talking about does it go down to that
[71:37] daily fair value gap that i was talking
[71:38] about before the market opened this
[71:40] morning
[71:41] and those things will deposit
[71:44] pseudo experience
[71:47] that over time results into real
[71:49] experience and then he can lean on those
[71:52] instances of experience where he's been
[71:54] here before
[71:55] he's not intimidated if he's done it
[71:57] wrong
[71:58] he's not fearful that the market's
[72:00] changing the way it does things because
[72:02] he's now suddenly profitable
[72:05] and it has a you know series of losing
[72:06] trades or whatever
[72:08] he's not losing his mind because
[72:11] he has taken a trade that he felt was
[72:14] lined with
[72:16] likelihood and
[72:17] probabilities in his favor but then
[72:19] failed
[72:21] he's not discouraged by that
[72:24] because he knows that these things
[72:25] repeat
[72:26] so
[72:27] best case scenario
[72:30] there's three opportunities for him a
[72:31] day
[72:33] he's looking for just one of them to
[72:35] yield five points
[72:36] if he does
[72:38] he makes more than half of his weekly
[72:40] salary on that one trade
[72:44] he's trying to do that
[72:47] once in the morning
[72:48] once in the afternoon he's taking a live
[72:50] trade in one or the other
[72:54] but once he gets one live trade
[72:56] he's trying to condition himself to do
[72:59] demo
[73:00] or he'll paper trade it whatever
[73:02] just watch it observe
[73:04] but he's not trying to
[73:06] do three trades a day
[73:08] initially i forced him into doing that i
[73:10] said take a trade in the morning take a
[73:12] trade in 8 30 take a trade at 9 30 take
[73:14] a trade at the afternoon and then take
[73:16] and also sometimes at three o'clock to
[73:19] four o'clock that market on closed macro
[73:21] that runs by the algorithm
[73:23] there's a little setup that forms most
[73:24] days of the week
[73:26] in that last hour
[73:28] it looks similar to this
[73:31] it might be a buy day it might be a buy
[73:33] setup not just a short setup but
[73:36] i'm taking you into specific times of
[73:38] the day time
[73:40] i'm taking him to the market at these
[73:42] times
[73:44] okay if you have not been paying
[73:47] attention this video i've literally laid
[73:49] in your lap
[73:51] the very moments that these setups are
[73:54] forming
[73:57] it's up to you to go through your charts
[73:58] and find out if that is true
[74:00] the lazy
[74:02] won't do it
[74:03] they want to be told what to do
[74:06] they don't want to go in and roll their
[74:07] sleeves up and find it but once you see
[74:09] this
[74:11] once you see it and you back test and
[74:12] you pull out with example after example
[74:15] after example of how the market sets up
[74:17] like this and it runs to liquidity above
[74:19] or below the marketplace
[74:22] count how many times
[74:24] over the last
[74:27] month
[74:28] three weeks two weeks one week
[74:31] how many setups offered five points with
[74:33] something just like this at these key
[74:34] times of the day
[74:38] and then do the math
[74:41] if you could just do one half of that
[74:45] or just one quarter of that with one
[74:47] mini
[74:51] it's real easy to see how
[74:53] it's just a matter of time
[74:56] before that thing you call a job
[74:58] no longer is a hindrance to you because
[75:00] it is a hindrance to you
[75:02] where you have your faith
[75:05] chained to their bosses
[75:08] generosity
[75:10] they're so generous that they make you
[75:13] work those 40 hours sometimes more
[75:16] to get that paycheck
[75:19] that uncle sam gets the tax before you
[75:21] touch it
[75:23] and you come out
[75:25] and find out that everything's
[75:28] much more expensive today
[75:32] when you have this skill set folks i
[75:34] want you to understand what i'm about to
[75:34] say and i'm going to close this video
[75:38] when you learn this skill set
[75:43] it removes fear
[75:46] it removes fear
[75:48] of missing out
[75:50] it removes the fear and anxiety of
[75:54] failing but it also removes the fear
[75:58] of inflation
[76:00] because
[76:01] this skill set will always outpace
[76:05] inflation
[76:07] i don't care if gas is 20 dollars a
[76:09] gallon
[76:10] i'm sure i'm gonna drive my corvettes
[76:13] i have eight cylinder corvettes that i
[76:14] absolutely will not leave parked i will
[76:16] drive them and i will enjoy them i don't
[76:19] care gas can be whatever it wants to be
[76:21] it's a write-off for me okay
[76:24] i don't care how much food is going to
[76:26] cost i hope i i can continuously find it
[76:29] but
[76:30] i'm not worried about what my utility
[76:32] bills are going to cost i don't worry
[76:34] about what things are going to cost
[76:36] that skill set that you're learning here
[76:40] it aids in that
[76:42] it helps in that notice i'm not
[76:44] promising you get rich notice i haven't
[76:47] said that
[76:49] because i don't want you coming to my
[76:50] channel thinking i'm promising you to
[76:52] get rich
[76:55] but i am promising you a skill set that
[76:59] offers the opportunity to do limitless
[77:04] limitless feats and wonders
[77:07] and it's only limited by your
[77:09] imagination
[77:11] how much work you're going to put into
[77:12] it
[77:13] how much work have you put into it who
[77:16] are you allowing to influence you
[77:18] and discourage you distract you
[77:22] are you seeing results am i proving this
[77:24] stuff works
[77:26] do you feel scammed
[77:28] or do you feel energized and thankful
[77:30] that you're part of a community like we
[77:32] have here that's
[77:33] thriving
[77:34] it's energetic
[77:36] they're happy they're uplifted
[77:39] they encourage one another
[77:41] and everyone here knows that they're not
[77:43] being taken for a ride
[77:45] there's no upsell coming
[77:47] doesn't that feel good it frees you up
[77:49] to just concentrate on learning there's
[77:52] no
[77:53] angle
[77:54] there's no sales pitch coming
[77:57] isn't that awesome
[77:58] isn't that cool that's
[78:00] like
[78:02] the the point is is you're you're in a
[78:04] community that we're all trying to help
[78:06] one another
[78:07] and all i'm trying to be is the captain
[78:09] of the team and just lead you in the
[78:12] right direction and hopefully avoid the
[78:13] pain and struggles that i went through
[78:19] real accounts
[78:20] real money real buttons are being pushed
[78:27] you are going to find
[78:31] that there is a lot of opportunity
[78:34] that you're going to let slip by
[78:36] and not be upset about it it's going to
[78:39] be one of the most fun experience
[78:41] that you're going to have as a
[78:43] developing and developed
[78:45] student of price action under me is
[78:47] you'll see so many setups you're like i
[78:49] could do this trigger now but i'm not
[78:50] going to
[78:51] and then walk away from after it comes
[78:53] to fruition
[78:55] thinking
[78:57] i could have done that and i had the
[79:00] discipline to say no
[79:02] because i'm not being influenced by fear
[79:04] or greed
[79:06] and when you're at that level
[79:09] and you're consistent
[79:11] you have graduated
[79:13] you are an independent thinker you have
[79:15] mastered fear and greed
[79:17] you have
[79:18] operated with a level of discipline that
[79:21] is unknown to majority of traders on
[79:24] youtube
[79:25] instagram facebook wherever
[79:33] that day is coming for you
[79:35] but you got to go through this stuff
[79:37] here to get to it
[79:39] it's not hiding from you
[79:40] i'm not making it hard for you i've
[79:43] literally taught you everything except
[79:44] for money management which we'll talk
[79:46] about next week
[79:47] and then you have the complete
[79:48] understanding of what it is you're doing
[79:50] here
[79:51] and you're just gonna
[79:52] do the same thing every day
[79:54] sometimes you'll get it right some days
[79:55] you won't when you get it wrong you stop
[79:58] you don't rush to get it back
[80:01] you're gonna find the next day sometimes
[80:03] there it is
[80:04] which he took as a loss the previous day
[80:06] comes back sometimes with interest
[80:09] and that's a good feeling when it
[80:11] happens it's like well you know i don't
[80:12] need to worry about it
[80:14] you know losing trades is like getting a
[80:16] flat tire
[80:17] it sucks it costs you a little bit of
[80:19] money and time delays you from what
[80:21] you're trying to get to and
[80:23] accomplish
[80:25] but it's just a speed bump
[80:27] cost a little bit of time and money
[80:29] but it didn't keep you from getting
[80:30] where you're going it just
[80:33] created a detour a
[80:36] delay
[80:38] but the inevitable happens still
[80:39] nonetheless you arrive at your
[80:41] destination your destination here is
[80:43] excellence and you don't get there
[80:44] overnight
[80:46] you get there gradually
[80:48] one step in front of the other a little
[80:50] bit here a little bit there sometimes
[80:52] you have to take a step or two back
[80:55] get your footing again and resume going
[80:57] forward and sometimes you'll have to
[80:59] take a detour once in a while
[81:02] that's all part of it that's the that's
[81:04] the growth
[81:05] that every trader goes through
[81:07] but when it gets hard for you
[81:09] when you feel like you want to quit
[81:11] that's a moment when you need to take a
[81:13] break take a week off don't watch my
[81:15] videos they'll be here i'm not taking my
[81:16] videos down
[81:18] take a week away from it enjoy another
[81:21] hobby
[81:22] and then come back to it fresh
[81:26] you want this to be enjoyable you do not
[81:28] want to make it i have to do this it
[81:31] must work i got to get out of my job
[81:32] right now because this is going to make
[81:34] it harder and longer for you to learn it
[81:37] have fun with it enjoy it
[81:40] i have to ask a question here and then
[81:42] obviously by the
[81:45] number of comments
[81:46] in either support of it or there's no
[81:49] interest in it whatever but if you'd be
[81:50] so kind to let me know in the comments
[81:52] section if you would like to see me
[81:54] do a very short
[81:56] i'm talking like
[81:57] two minute three minute review
[82:00] each day where the setups were
[82:03] for the s p
[82:05] and or nasdaq i'm not going to do both
[82:06] of because it takes too much time to do
[82:08] that
[82:09] but where were there setups for
[82:11] you to engage with what i'm teaching you
[82:13] here in this mentorship
[82:15] if you'd like to see that as a monday
[82:16] through friday short little
[82:18] upload
[82:20] just let me know in the comment section
[82:21] below also if you could include also
[82:24] what your experience has been so far
[82:26] under my teachings on this youtube
[82:27] channel has it been a positive
[82:28] experience for you has it been not so
[82:30] much of a impact on you or has it been
[82:32] just simply waffle
[82:34] maybe i'm you know missing the mark
[82:36] entirely be honest with me but just be
[82:38] respectful if if it hasn't been your
[82:42] cup of tea yeah you can respectfully
[82:44] tell me that and that's okay i'll just
[82:45] use your feedback to hopefully try to
[82:48] dig in a little bit deeper and and maybe
[82:50] i can find something that helps you or
[82:52] maybe not i don't know but i'm looking
[82:54] for feedback and that way you can help
[82:56] me in that regard in the comment section
