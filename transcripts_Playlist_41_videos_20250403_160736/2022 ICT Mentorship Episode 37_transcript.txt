[00:02] all right folks welcome back
[00:04] hope everyone's doing well
[00:06] so we are in episode 37
[00:09] of the continuing series of the ict
[00:10] mentorship for youtube 2022. here's our
[00:13] daily chart for the e-mini s p june
[00:15] contract for 2020.
[00:18] and you can see we have
[00:21] worked inside this fair value got
[00:24] this is also a breaker
[00:26] okay breaker is a low
[00:28] high
[00:29] low or low find the high in between
[00:31] extending out in time the market trades
[00:33] down into that
[00:34] it's also
[00:36] coming down in to fill in
[00:38] this fair value gap
[00:40] so we came down fill that in
[00:42] and now we're starting the rally next
[00:43] bicep liquidity is this short-term high
[00:45] here
[00:47] and then if we can get some acceleration
[00:48] from the upside
[00:50] we have relative equal highs up here
[00:52] and that fair value got okay so
[00:56] for the students here that are looking
[00:58] for
[01:00] a little bit more meat on the bone
[01:02] for bias
[01:04] okay
[01:06] when the market is moved from a low like
[01:09] this and starts to trade higher and
[01:10] creates a swing low it's easy to assume
[01:14] that it might want to come back up to
[01:15] this high here so notice how each day
[01:17] with the exception there's one single
[01:18] day here
[01:20] each day was bullish
[01:22] okay so the bias would be expected to be
[01:24] bullish until we take out this high
[01:27] it does that here
[01:29] then
[01:30] we have a day or two of retracement
[01:33] which is logical because we created a
[01:35] fair value gap here
[01:36] it trades down fills it in once more
[01:40] tests it and rallies
[01:42] so we're looking for tomorrow which is
[01:44] friday non-farm payroll is a day i do
[01:47] not advise anyone to actually try to
[01:49] speculate on
[01:51] now there's going to be a
[01:53] group out there that have said i've made
[01:55] money doing
[01:56] a non-profit payroll trades
[01:59] my reasoning for telling you not to
[02:01] trade
[02:02] is because
[02:04] you're here to learn how to read price
[02:05] action so if i say
[02:08] go out there and study non-farm payroll
[02:10] friday price action which can tend to be
[02:13] very volatile
[02:15] choppy
[02:16] or sometimes it becomes a dud it doesn't
[02:18] do anything
[02:19] but you don't have the experience to
[02:22] weather something that's very volatile
[02:24] and can be
[02:26] jarring to you okay and if you're out
[02:28] here trying to gamble with live money
[02:30] which is what none of you should be
[02:31] doing
[02:32] if you're in here learning how to
[02:34] reprice that's why you're here to learn
[02:35] how to read price
[02:38] months from now
[02:40] if you come to the conclusion that you
[02:41] think you've done well enough on paper
[02:44] and then demo consistently
[02:47] if you decide to go into live trading
[02:48] you've done that on your own i've done
[02:49] nothing to instigate that or try to get
[02:52] you to do it okay
[02:54] so
[02:56] bias
[02:57] is going to be derived from this chart
[02:59] here
[03:00] because
[03:02] we're likely to run this short-term high
[03:04] that's what i'm thinking i'm expecting
[03:06] that it could happen overnight
[03:10] there's there's nothing saying it's
[03:11] going to wait until tomorrow 8 30 when
[03:13] non-farm payroll comes out
[03:14] but if it doesn't
[03:16] run out this high tonight
[03:19] at 8 30
[03:20] if we're above
[03:22] the fair value gap
[03:24] high here in other words the
[03:27] candle sticks low here if we're above
[03:29] that level
[03:30] at 8 30 and we have not taken out that
[03:33] high
[03:34] i would expect price to try to make an
[03:36] attempt to get to that level it doesn't
[03:38] need to go through it
[03:40] but the bias would be i would expect
[03:42] that to be
[03:43] attempted okay
[03:45] now does that mean go out and try to
[03:47] trade not for a payroll tomorrow no a
[03:49] lot can happen from the time of this
[03:50] recording which is a little bit before
[03:52] nine o'clock eastern time in the united
[03:54] states
[03:56] so i'm not trying to trade not from
[03:58] payroll okay i'm not instigating any
[04:02] interest for you to go out and do it
[04:04] tomorrow but i do believe that you
[04:06] should
[04:07] study it
[04:09] try to determine what side of liquidity
[04:11] is going to reach for before 8 30 news
[04:12] release and when that volatility hits
[04:15] the marketplace
[04:17] watch and see what it does on like a one
[04:19] and five minute chart get a feel for
[04:21] what it's doing
[04:22] and it's an amazing study for liquidity
[04:24] purposes only but unfortunately
[04:27] sometimes these moves
[04:29] can appear
[04:31] well
[04:33] to the untrained eye
[04:36] random
[04:37] and then to the initiated here
[04:40] sometimes the patterns that i'm teaching
[04:42] you in the logic materialize in the
[04:44] chart and sometimes they do pan out to
[04:47] script
[04:48] but not always
[04:50] so the reason why i tell everyone to
[04:51] avoid like big days like fomc
[04:54] and not from payroll weeks is because
[04:57] you don't have the experience
[04:59] and you can get hurt
[05:01] very quickly
[05:02] not knowing what you're doing so i try
[05:04] to be responsible as a mentor
[05:06] try to protect you from yourself because
[05:08] like i was when i was younger it was
[05:10] very easy for me to fall into a trap or
[05:14] think i can do something i couldn't
[05:16] so that way you understand
[05:18] i try to teach my students to stop
[05:20] trading by the new york session on
[05:22] wednesday so if you had something that
[05:24] was profitable quote unquote
[05:26] up to that point stop trading for the
[05:28] rest of the week and then
[05:30] observe
[05:31] just study the price action the rest of
[05:33] the week but don't try to push any
[05:34] buttons because you don't have any
[05:36] experience working in these
[05:40] sometimes very challenging market
[05:42] profiles on the thursday and friday of
[05:44] non-farm payroll weeks they can be
[05:46] choppy they can be sporadic they can
[05:48] come back against you when you really
[05:50] don't expect them to and they lose a lot
[05:53] of their precision
[05:55] not all the time but most of the time
[05:57] they lose their precision
[05:58] so i want to be focusing on those days
[06:00] where
[06:01] i don't have those disadvantages where
[06:03] everyone else is like well i got time to
[06:04] be in front of the charts so it's gamble
[06:06] and it's casino time
[06:08] and that's not the way i do things and
[06:10] i'm trying to promote the idea of a
[06:12] super mindset about what it is you're
[06:14] dealing and respect the measure of risk
[06:18] so be mindful of these levels here the
[06:19] two blue lines here
[06:21] and that red line here it's a little bit
[06:23] lighter than these you won't see these
[06:24] on a lower time frame but this here is
[06:26] that short term high here
[06:28] and the two blue lines here are
[06:30] respective to that fair value gap on the
[06:33] daily chart
[06:34] [Music]
[06:38] all right hourly chart e-mini s p
[06:42] market trades down to the discount
[06:45] low the fair value gap again these
[06:46] levels here are not drawn because of the
[06:48] basis of support resistance on an hourly
[06:51] chart okay these are the same levels
[06:53] that i drew on
[06:55] the daily and my change time frames from
[06:57] daily to hourly
[07:00] they transpose to these levels here
[07:02] respectively okay
[07:04] so the market trades down
[07:06] on
[07:07] wednesday hits the fair value gap low
[07:11] then we consolidate and then we drop one
[07:13] more time to it here then we make a debt
[07:15] mad dash to take out the short term high
[07:18] here we have a shift in market structure
[07:20] that's bullish
[07:22] we take out this short term high here
[07:23] and relative equal highs
[07:25] and now we're gravitating towards what
[07:26] looks like a run on the buy side here
[07:28] now it does not need to do that tomorrow
[07:30] i could be wrong about that
[07:32] i'm just saying that i think that this
[07:34] is the next draw on liquidity so study
[07:36] that that's all
[07:38] now we do have a small little fair value
[07:39] gap in here be mindful that you might
[07:41] want to drop down into that before going
[07:43] up there that's certainly something to
[07:44] study also
[07:46] all right on the 15 minute time frame
[07:48] you can see here this is the
[07:50] markup for
[07:52] the short-term high here
[07:54] on
[07:56] wednesday's trading we hit the fair
[07:58] value gap low on the daily chart
[08:02] went back hung around in consolidation
[08:04] rallied up
[08:06] and i was in here trying to get a feel
[08:07] for what it wanted to do i was thinking
[08:09] that i could capture a run to take the
[08:11] buy side out here
[08:13] that's what i was aiming for initially
[08:15] really early in the session
[08:17] and this got chopped up a lot in here
[08:19] and it's fine i really don't care about
[08:20] that but once i realized it wasn't
[08:22] trying to rally
[08:24] and they we're going to try to take it
[08:25] once more below the new york midnight
[08:28] opening which is this candle here
[08:31] i want you to take a look at
[08:33] the way this day formed before i get
[08:35] into any more discussion about it
[08:37] we open here
[08:39] consolidated rallied up and then dropped
[08:42] down into
[08:44] the fairway gap low
[08:46] on the daily chart
[08:47] and bounced there
[08:49] rallied up took out the short term high
[08:51] here and kept on rallying and enclosed
[08:54] here
[08:55] this
[08:57] formation of price action
[09:00] is what i dub my ict power 3 where it's
[09:04] accumulating
[09:05] manipulating
[09:07] distributing
[09:09] so it's
[09:10] opening create the low of the day
[09:13] and then rally
[09:14] now
[09:18] if you see this pattern
[09:20] on a daily chart
[09:22] it's easy to understand but when you
[09:24] look at the lower time frames it's easy
[09:25] to get lost in all the candlesticks and
[09:27] all the volatility and the movement and
[09:29] the quick fluctuations on these one
[09:31] minute and five minute charts
[09:33] that's why the uninitiated will look at
[09:35] and say it's noise it's it's not noise
[09:38] okay it's doing what it does on the
[09:40] daily chart just being represented on a
[09:43] smaller interval
[09:45] like a one or five minute chart
[09:47] so
[09:48] if you lose the context of like for
[09:50] instance the levels here
[09:52] and here
[09:53] you won't understand that it's dropping
[09:55] down to the higher time frame
[09:58] key level
[09:59] which is the very very cap low
[10:02] then the market can rally higher
[10:04] but
[10:05] once i got on side i shorted from in
[10:08] here and
[10:10] covered inside this candle as we were
[10:11] dipping below the short-term low
[10:15] i forced myself to engage not because
[10:18] i'm breaking rules not because i'm
[10:19] undisciplined but because i want to
[10:21] teach you
[10:22] why i avoid these days because
[10:25] my precision drops precipitously
[10:28] i don't have
[10:30] the
[10:31] the visibility on these particular days
[10:34] that i do have on others
[10:36] so
[10:38] if you have a built-in advantage
[10:40] why would you go to an area or arena
[10:44] where you have built-in disadvantages
[10:48] if you have advantages by trading on the
[10:50] days that don't create these types of
[10:52] conditions
[10:54] you trade in those arenas and then that
[10:56] time frame
[10:58] and you avoid the times where
[10:59] historically
[11:01] your
[11:01] proven walk forward real trading results
[11:05] have been diminished on these particular
[11:08] days so how many times you have to have
[11:09] your
[11:10] flesh torn open and bleed out before you
[11:12] realize this is probably
[11:14] a time of the month where i shouldn't be
[11:16] doing anything or lower my expectations
[11:19] in terms of the measure of precision
[11:22] so over 30 years that's what i've come
[11:24] to trust
[11:26] especially as a mentor teaching other
[11:28] people how to read price action i really
[11:30] press upon my students to stop trading
[11:32] on wednesday by the new york session so
[11:34] if you haven't bagged anything
[11:37] by that time from sunday's
[11:40] weekly open until until wednesday's new
[11:42] york session begins don't do any trades
[11:45] and deal with that
[11:48] desire of wanting to trade but don't do
[11:50] anything
[11:51] that forges discipline it forges
[11:54] patience and it also teaches you
[11:57] especially when the weeks are really bad
[11:59] and it doesn't give you a whole lot of
[12:00] movement you're going to be rewarded
[12:02] psychologically and emotionally because
[12:04] you didn't do anything
[12:06] but
[12:07] on twitter
[12:09] i've coached those individuals there too
[12:11] and i said don't take any trades don't
[12:14] do it
[12:15] and
[12:16] today they did
[12:17] and they regretted it
[12:19] so
[12:22] some people decide to listen to me after
[12:25] the pain but my whole point in doing
[12:26] these types of lessons in lectures is to
[12:29] try to spare you from all that you don't
[12:31] have to go through the same things i did
[12:33] painfully to learn the lessons
[12:35] so
[12:36] listen okay it's for your benefit
[12:40] so anyway
[12:41] i went short in here and i shared that
[12:43] on a vignette little tiny little video
[12:45] clip
[12:46] where you can see the uh the business
[12:48] and the executions and such but
[12:50] the
[12:52] the afternoon
[12:54] that's set up i want to go into that a
[12:56] little bit
[12:58] and
[13:00] i didn't buy anything down here i didn't
[13:02] do any of that turn here i was actually
[13:05] shopping for some things that i need for
[13:07] the summer so it took my attention away
[13:09] from being down here but
[13:12] once i got back to
[13:14] the screens and i saw
[13:16] the market dropping down into this area
[13:18] here i tweeted
[13:21] and i asked everyone on twitter
[13:24] if they could find the five minute fair
[13:26] value at the above price
[13:28] and i gave them a minute or two and i
[13:30] shared a chart in case
[13:33] they were confused as to what it was
[13:35] being discussed
[13:37] so my expectation was we're here
[13:40] and we were likely to drop into that
[13:43] in the pm session so in other words as
[13:45] we going into lunch and on the other
[13:47] side of the lunch we could have easily
[13:49] traded up into this area as an upside
[13:50] objective and then i didn't mention it
[13:53] but you obviously know if we get above
[13:54] that movie the next logical
[13:56] draw on liquidity it'll be about this
[13:58] high here okay
[14:00] so
[14:03] on twitter if you want to go over to
[14:06] twitter you can see this is my handle a
[14:08] lot of you guys keep asking i've already
[14:09] mentioned it on
[14:11] several videos now but it's the at
[14:14] symbol
[14:15] capital i
[14:16] underscore one time
[14:18] am
[14:20] underscore
[14:21] t h e underscore ict i am the inner
[14:25] circle trader or i am the ict
[14:28] so you don't have to follow me on
[14:31] twitter i'm not looking for a lot of
[14:32] follow since i'm not trying to get
[14:33] everybody to follow me in fact you can
[14:35] just go to
[14:37] twitter.combackslash and put this here
[14:39] in without the at symbol and you can
[14:41] look at my tweets they're not protected
[14:42] so that way you don't have to join that
[14:44] platform okay so i know there's a lot of
[14:45] people that simply will not join because
[14:48] all the politics is associated with it i
[14:49] get it but
[14:51] we're over there having fun
[14:53] and hopefully you know you guys can
[14:55] check it out and join the fun if not
[14:56] then that's cool but it's a little bit
[14:58] more time friendly
[15:01] and easier to be alerted
[15:03] unlike the community tab on my youtube
[15:04] channel
[15:05] i'm not really sure
[15:07] why sometimes people don't get
[15:09] notifications and sometimes they do
[15:11] i don't know so when you guys contact me
[15:14] or send me messages through tradingview
[15:15] or whatever
[15:16] asking me there's things i don't know
[15:18] okay i just put videos up or posts and
[15:21] if you get them you get them if you
[15:22] don't you have to go to the actual
[15:24] community post and see it but twitter
[15:26] obviously has always been my playground
[15:28] i've enjoyed it in the past and you can
[15:30] see here the time
[15:31] 11 37 a.m this is local time eastern
[15:34] time
[15:35] and
[15:36] june 2nd
[15:37] i asked everyone
[15:39] on e-mini s p five-minute chart locate
[15:41] the fair value up above market price
[15:43] that's this one here okay so i gave a
[15:45] little bit of time
[15:46] for folks to look for it themselves and
[15:48] then
[15:49] i gave this here okay so the market was
[15:51] trading right
[15:52] there and draw on look what it was here
[15:56] okay
[15:57] so
[15:58] obviously you can see here
[16:00] we did shortly after that it was bagged
[16:02] and tagged
[16:03] was it was trading up into that level
[16:05] there
[16:07] so the question is going to be
[16:09] what's the purpose of that you know
[16:11] what's the whole reason for me bringing
[16:12] it up you know that's not a trade ict
[16:15] that's not a a button being pushed
[16:18] that's not a
[16:19] an entry a stop and a target right
[16:22] i'm teaching you by being your spotter
[16:25] sometimes i'll see things and i'll say
[16:27] look at this or study that
[16:30] for clarity folks that is not a trade
[16:33] signal i'm not telling you to buy or
[16:35] sell anything
[16:36] i am trying to inspire you to look at
[16:38] price with the things i'm teaching you
[16:41] real time at that moment
[16:43] before it actually develops and delivers
[16:45] in price before your charts actually
[16:47] show it
[16:48] i'm taking your attention to the right
[16:50] side of the marketplace
[16:51] i'm pointing to a level i want you to
[16:53] study where we are at that time at
[16:55] market price which is in this example
[16:57] here
[16:59] and then study how it gets to that level
[17:00] i'm sometimes going to be wrong folks
[17:02] okay admittedly i'm i'm gonna do it
[17:04] wrong okay but i want you to study
[17:07] from when i say take notice of something
[17:11] and study and see if it wants to deliver
[17:12] that
[17:13] by a specific time
[17:15] okay
[17:16] i've noticed since um
[17:19] i'll comment on something
[17:21] on twitter
[17:22] it's almost like it immediately runs to
[17:24] it
[17:25] so
[17:26] that's also an interesting thing for me
[17:27] i'm not sure
[17:31] what to make of that but i know once i
[17:33] say something
[17:34] it's really quick to be johnny on the
[17:36] spot and get to where i'm pointing to so
[17:38] i'll leave that up for you to decide if
[17:40] it's anything
[17:42] noteworthy behind that
[17:44] all right so this is a two-minute chart
[17:46] and before i even get into this
[17:49] this is not a trade entry and this is
[17:51] not a trade exit okay if you look at the
[17:53] shape of these arrows okay
[17:56] i'm not trying to defraud you i'm not
[17:58] trying to fake something i'm not trying
[17:59] to pretend that i took this trade okay i
[18:01] did not do it
[18:03] i'm just showing you graphically this is
[18:05] how you would have your chart
[18:07] so if you want to journal things after
[18:09] the fact what you want to do is you have
[18:11] your chart set up like this and you have
[18:13] an order block
[18:14] the down closed candle prior to this
[18:16] move up here and then we drop after
[18:18] consolidation
[18:20] into the fairway gap right there
[18:23] right here is where i tweeted
[18:26] look at this
[18:27] very valuable
[18:28] so price was here
[18:30] that was the moment of the tweet and
[18:32] then up to here it delivers
[18:34] so the pattern is this
[18:36] okay
[18:38] so when you have that you go back into
[18:39] your charts you mark it up like this and
[18:42] then over here you want to put down any
[18:44] observations how long did it take
[18:47] before this
[18:48] move started to be delivered to the
[18:49] upside
[18:50] after it went into the fair bay gap well
[18:53] this each one of these candles is two
[18:54] minutes right
[18:55] so it went into it here
[18:58] here said it's four minutes and then
[19:01] six minutes
[19:02] and then starts delivering six minutes
[19:04] after hitting it
[19:06] and then it took
[19:08] one
[19:08] two three four five six seven eight nine
[19:14] roughly 20 minutes to deliver that
[19:16] expectation and price so it went from a
[19:18] discount
[19:20] how's this discount
[19:21] we moved from the low to here
[19:24] think about what's being shown
[19:26] we are
[19:28] above
[19:28] the new york men like opening price
[19:31] so the market
[19:33] dropped down to a discount creating the
[19:34] low of the day now we above
[19:36] this opening price and we're going into
[19:39] lunch
[19:40] here is
[19:42] the new york session lunch hour
[19:45] so we have time before 12 o'clock for
[19:48] this to potentially deliver but i was
[19:50] giving it time see if it wants to go
[19:51] there in the pm session which will be on
[19:53] the other side
[19:54] of lunch around one o'clock to 1 30 and
[19:56] then start to deliver that but like i
[19:58] was mentioning moments ago
[20:00] lately when i post or talk about
[20:02] anything it's like
[20:03] it wants to get there right away
[20:05] so again make of it what you want but
[20:09] after you have your
[20:10] annotations on your chart you want to
[20:13] basically put down any observation that
[20:15] you notice but you want to
[20:16] phrase it in such a way like you saw
[20:19] this in advance so what happens is
[20:22] you're tricking your subconscious into
[20:24] believing that this is a
[20:26] experience that you really had
[20:29] and it's like self it's called self talk
[20:31] okay you're reassuring and reinforcing
[20:33] something that would be a positive thing
[20:35] for you
[20:36] and while you may not have seen that
[20:38] trade and you didn't have the experience
[20:40] that i was showing on twitter today
[20:41] before it happened
[20:43] you borrow that experience for the study
[20:47] but in your journaling your chart would
[20:49] look like this okay and then you would
[20:51] fill in these little areas where it
[20:53] where it would draw on your observations
[20:55] the things that
[20:57] you saw come to fruition and never try
[20:59] to put anything negative in it don't say
[21:01] i wish i would have saw this or i was
[21:03] foolish and i didn't see this unfold and
[21:07] i missed another trade or
[21:09] i'm never going to get this this is
[21:10] frustrating
[21:12] these journal entries are for you
[21:14] to reflect upon
[21:16] at a later time
[21:18] and you want them to be positive you
[21:19] want to basically
[21:21] cheerlead yourself in your journaling
[21:24] and keep things very fact oriented
[21:27] everything is a matter of fact
[21:29] and you want to phrase it like you saw
[21:31] it beforehand and over time how much
[21:33] time i don't know but when you do this
[21:36] for weeks and months maybe half a year
[21:38] or so certainly by the first year of
[21:40] doing it
[21:41] you will have tricked your brain
[21:44] into having all of this pseudo
[21:46] experience
[21:47] the benefit of this
[21:49] because you're logging the chart and
[21:51] making it look like this and retaining
[21:52] and then referring back to them
[21:54] each weekend looking at the previous
[21:56] week looking at the previous month and
[21:58] just scrolling through your charts and
[21:59] reading your annotations
[22:01] yes it's laborious yes it takes time yes
[22:05] it is boring in the beginning but when
[22:07] you start learning to see these things
[22:10] form live
[22:12] then you'll understand the benefit of
[22:14] having done it
[22:15] because this is how you get it
[22:17] nothing else gives it to you watching my
[22:19] videos will not do it for you you have
[22:22] to be in here doing this part if you
[22:24] fail under my tutelage it's because you
[22:26] don't do this
[22:29] okay this is where everybody that fails
[22:32] starts their tailspin into failure they
[22:35] don't want to do this stuff they're like
[22:36] i ain't doing that i ain't got time for
[22:38] that
[22:39] well then you don't want to succeed
[22:40] because i'm telling you there's no
[22:41] shortcut around it you will do this or
[22:44] you will fail period and the story have
[22:46] a nice day
[22:50] now notice what we have here we have a
[22:52] short term low here during the new york
[22:54] lunch
[22:55] hour
[22:57] we're consolidating the market drops
[22:59] back down
[23:00] and takes out that short term low
[23:02] we have unfinished business about that
[23:05] old high here
[23:09] this is a stop run
[23:11] here
[23:12] and it just slowly drifts up
[23:15] and takes that old high out the only
[23:17] setup i liked was obviously the short
[23:20] and the re-entry in addition to the
[23:22] short i did and you can see that on the
[23:24] vignette that i posted on
[23:26] twitter so i'm not going to bog the
[23:27] video down here with that it's already
[23:28] made public
[23:30] the afternoon session or after the low
[23:32] was formed
[23:34] notice there's no model entry for what
[23:36] i've taught you so far
[23:38] but we have a nice fair value gap with
[23:41] the continuation of the upside with a
[23:42] fair value gap i was pointing out real
[23:44] time before it happened
[23:46] so this would be the only other setup
[23:47] which i did not take it's i didn't trade
[23:49] this in a demo account i didn't demo
[23:51] trade it but i did give you the logic to
[23:52] look for real time in twitter before it
[23:54] unfolded so
[23:56] this is the framework that you would
[23:57] have in your journal and everything i
[23:59] mentioned in this
[24:00] lecture tonight hopefully was insightful
[24:02] to you and helpful and i will touch base
[24:04] with you again next tuesday lord willing
[24:07] until i'll talk to you next time be safe
