[00:05] all right folks welcome back this is
[00:06] episode nine for the 2022 ICT mentorship
[00:09] on
[00:11] YouTube this lecture is going to be on
[00:13] Power Three which is accumulation
[00:14] manipulation and distribution and New
[00:17] York PM session
[00:25] opportunities all right so we're looking
[00:26] at the NASDAQ e- mini Futures this is
[00:30] The Continuous chart on trading
[00:33] view so if you look at the daily range
[00:36] where we've
[00:38] been we're inside this range here okay
[00:42] so we
[00:43] have this swing
[00:45] high and this swing low now why am I
[00:48] picking these two reference points well
[00:50] namely this is the low most recently
[00:53] after taking out this short-term low so
[00:56] we've dug into all the sell side
[00:58] liquidity resting below that
[01:00] low we retraced back up inside of this
[01:04] High to that low so we went back up
[01:08] into a premium the range high to low
[01:13] running a fib just to get the 50% level
[01:15] that gives us equilibrium anything below
[01:18] that is a
[01:21] discount notice how the market traded
[01:23] down on Monday into a deep
[01:26] discount but did not
[01:30] take out these lows over
[01:32] here but look how we closed on
[01:35] Monday we had an indecisive candle the
[01:39] body was basically absent the open and
[01:41] close was essentially you the same
[01:44] thing if we have that and the Market's
[01:47] trading down into a discount even though
[01:51] we might
[01:53] have a load down here that we're
[01:56] targeting this may require a retracement
[02:00] now notice at the close of Monday's
[02:02] trading we had an imbalance from this
[02:04] low and this
[02:07] high on Tuesday's trading
[02:10] overnight the equities
[02:13] markets had a run up into
[02:15] this imbalance here so this fair value
[02:19] Gap was ret traded to in
[02:23] here this
[02:25] low and this High we'll look at that in
[02:28] reference to the lower time frame
[02:34] this lower
[02:35] level is the low end of the fair value
[02:37] gap on the daily chart and this level up
[02:40] here is the upper end of the fair value
[02:43] Gap I'm taking your attention to
[02:46] Monday's
[02:48] trading and I want to talk a little bit
[02:50] about power three which is accumulation
[02:53] distribution and manipulation okay
[02:57] so generally my teachings are like this
[03:00] if I'm
[03:01] bullish I'm expecting the opening price
[03:04] to be near the low of the day or the
[03:08] session then it trades lower making some
[03:11] important low and then
[03:13] rallies creates a
[03:16] high and then closes near the high of
[03:18] the day now it's not important for you
[03:21] to try to predict the closing price what
[03:24] I'm trying to train you to
[03:26] anticipate is the likelihood of the
[03:28] market making some kind kind of a fake
[03:31] move like a Judas swing okay Judas swing
[03:33] is the false move typically in London
[03:38] and in New York session there are fake
[03:41] runs that start off a move and I walked
[03:45] you through it last week on my community
[03:47] tab where I outlined the actual Judas
[03:50] swing for that particular day using the
[03:52] fair value Gap outlin the the low I was
[03:56] only off by cor of a point for the low
[03:57] in that range and that created the low
[03:59] today the idea is what I'm going to show
[04:02] you here as
[04:04] well on Monday we had price Dro down
[04:08] overnight Consolidated and then we have
[04:10] a little bit of a rally ahead of the
[04:12] equities open okay so in here we have
[04:15] 8:30 in the morning if you look at 8:30
[04:19] what do we have we have the highs over
[04:21] here they're suspect because they're
[04:23] relative equal highs there but look what
[04:25] we left here ahead of 8:30 we had this
[04:28] huge imbalance
[04:31] so if we run these highs out after the
[04:35] open at
[04:37] 9:30 it's likely to trade down into that
[04:40] and rebounds but watch what it does it
[04:42] and we trade up into that level here
[04:44] which creates the fair value gaps
[04:46] low-end
[04:47] parameter remember this is Monday's
[04:49] trading it sells off so this line isn't
[04:52] here on Monday that's not what we're
[04:55] looking at we're looking at the
[04:56] likelihood of coming back down into this
[04:58] area here
[05:00] after taking these highs
[05:01] out if it does so if it trades back into
[05:04] this imbalance that's a good candidate
[05:08] to go
[05:09] long now the imbalance in here if you go
[05:12] to the left of it you can see the down
[05:13] close candles that's your bullish order
[05:15] block the market trades down hits the
[05:18] order block and it's an afternoon trade
[05:20] so it starts to rally and then
[05:23] consolidates since to close overnight we
[05:26] create a wicked run last night this was
[05:29] an it ran last night and most of all the
[05:32] move for today was done before we even
[05:35] got to the opening of the
[05:38] morning had a little bit of a
[05:40] retracement after 8:30 and at 9:30 we
[05:45] Consolidated I'll talk a little bit
[05:46] about that as a market profile in a
[05:48] moment but then we drop down create an
[05:51] important low of the day and then we
[05:53] rally it got real close to the fair
[05:55] value gaps high-end parameter but didn't
[05:59] get to it
[06:00] we don't need it's just like I was
[06:02] mentioning here you don't need to try to
[06:03] predict the closing price with power
[06:06] three which is accumulation manipulation
[06:10] so in other words if you're bullish it
[06:11] opens where you think it's going to
[06:13] trade higher it's going to be most
[06:15] likely a small little move lower that's
[06:18] the move you want to try to go in and
[06:20] Hunt along if you miss it you want to
[06:22] try to get long real close to where the
[06:24] opening price is now the question is
[06:26] going to be is where is the opening
[06:27] price well I like 830 okay you use the
[06:31] opening price here at 830 draw that out
[06:34] in time did we go below it yes did we go
[06:36] inside the imbalance yes did we take out
[06:38] a short-term low yes did we hit an order
[06:40] block yes was it an optimal trade entry
[06:42] yes lots of factors there over here same
[06:46] thing opening price here did we trade
[06:49] lower than that yes did it go even lower
[06:52] than that later on in the afternoon yes
[06:55] then it rallied taking out the relative
[06:56] equal highs here and again gravitating
[06:58] towards that upper end of that fair
[07:00] value gap on the daily
[07:05] chart now I'm in a 5 minute chart on
[07:07] that same February 14th and I want to
[07:11] take you closer to what price is done in
[07:13] here that imbalance the lowest portion
[07:16] of it here with all the down closed
[07:18] candles here now this is anchored to the
[07:21] Daily bullish order block but you can
[07:23] see how we traded into it here with one
[07:27] two three four down closed candles that
[07:29] is a
[07:31] complete order block on this time frame
[07:33] so consecutive down closed candles right
[07:35] before a price surge that has an
[07:39] imbalance that's how you find your order
[07:41] blocks okay so a high probability order
[07:43] block would be your narrative or your
[07:46] bias is
[07:47] bullish you're looking for displacement
[07:50] that's this right here where the market
[07:52] runs real quick higher and the down
[07:54] close candles you want to mark that out
[07:57] and anticipate a return back in to that
[08:00] now again this level is not there yet we
[08:02] don't know this level until Monday's
[08:04] close so don't be tricked thinking that
[08:06] I have this level here and I knew it was
[08:08] going to go right to that level in term
[08:10] I'm not suggesting that at all what I'm
[08:11] suggesting is is watch what happens when
[08:14] it creates that high it breaks
[08:17] down all this price action here gets
[08:21] overran into a retracement back down
[08:23] into this imbalance here the low of this
[08:25] candle and the high of this candle that
[08:27] right there that's your fair value
[08:30] got with an order
[08:33] block and optimal trade
[08:35] entry rallies even though it's sloppy
[08:39] it's still continuously driving
[08:43] higher this high at the close on this
[08:47] day here at say 4:30 okay 4:30 in
[08:50] afternoon to me that's like the close
[08:51] for me no it trades a little bit later
[08:55] than that and then closes for a little
[08:57] while and it also technically closes
[08:59] when the bell rings at 4:00 p.m. you
[09:02] local time in New
[09:04] York because there's a little bit of
[09:06] trading past that I like to just look at
[09:08] 430 and just consider that where we are
[09:11] in terms of what we've done for the full
[09:13] range and then determine what I have
[09:15] left for maybe inbalance or liquidity
[09:23] pools here
[09:26] is that drop down
[09:29] here on a one minute
[09:31] chart it's digging into that order block
[09:35] right
[09:36] here if you look real close let me go
[09:39] back up one slide I want you to see what
[09:40] I'm showing you here right here this
[09:43] price action see 14140
[09:47] 14120 this little area right here I'm
[09:49] looking at on a one minute
[09:51] chart 14140 14120 that in that vicinity
[09:57] see that small little Gap right there
[09:59] see that see the swing High we trade
[10:03] above it create a fair value Gap there
[10:06] trade down into it this is an afternoon
[10:08] trade this is 2:00 in the afternoon
[10:11] local time in New York inside the order
[10:13] block inside the fair value Gap inside a
[10:18] retracement of the fair value Gap that
[10:21] sets the stage of a market run up
[10:25] into a higher retracement
[10:30] now we don't know if this is going to be
[10:33] the
[10:35] closing parameter for a daily fair value
[10:38] Gap we don't need to know that yet but
[10:41] this is a likely scenario to go long and
[10:44] we can look for a run back up into this
[10:47] range
[10:48] here or run the buy stops above here or
[10:51] maybe inside
[10:53] here sloppy run but nonetheless it's
[10:57] still pressing higher
[11:01] now here's today on the 15th of February
[11:03] 2022 notice what we had with had this
[11:07] enormous price run overnight in
[11:10] technically the London
[11:11] session
[11:13] now a lot of you going to ask would I
[11:15] have caught this no no I wouldn't have
[11:18] caught it I would have missed it and I
[11:20] would if I was awake I wouldn't have
[11:21] seen it coming let's just put it that
[11:23] way so this right here was a complete
[11:26] surprise to me when I woke up saw it
[11:29] but I want you to think about when you
[11:31] have these overnight runs that were
[11:33] basically these big moves overnight
[11:35] before the session begins in New York
[11:38] when you're trading equities this also
[11:40] works with Forex too so it's important
[11:42] try not to chase price this is what I
[11:43] mean by don't chase it don't chase it
[11:46] last week when I was commenting and
[11:48] outlining the NASDAQ and giving you a
[11:50] fair value Gap real time explaining to
[11:52] where I thought it was going to draw
[11:53] down to and it created the New York
[11:55] session low of the day okay that's what
[11:57] I was outlining just take a look at go
[11:59] back and look at you'll see it's it's
[12:01] pretty obvious the same logic I'm
[12:03] amplifying that here okay overnight what
[12:06] was the market doing it was rallying so
[12:08] when we open up at 8:30 do we go in here
[12:11] and start buying it just because it's
[12:13] gone up overnight no we don't chase it
[12:16] you have to wait no we don't chase it we
[12:18] have to wait for more information what
[12:19] information are we waiting for well
[12:21] typically whenever you see a big run up
[12:23] or a big run down there's a
[12:25] consolidation that takes place shortly
[12:27] after now not always it just keeps on
[12:29] ripping higher or lower and you'll
[12:32] either miss a move or if you get lucky
[12:34] maybe you can participate in it but this
[12:37] is what I typically look for so if
[12:39] there's a lot of range movement
[12:41] overnight which overnight um 2 o'cl in
[12:44] the morning to 5 o' in the morning okay
[12:47] if we get a big run like that which is
[12:48] what we're seeing
[12:50] here right away in my mind I'm thinking
[12:53] don't trade a lot don't
[12:56] expect a lot of in and out in and out
[12:59] perect you know perfect Precision wait
[13:01] for a real significant price move
[13:04] otherwise you're going to get chopped up
[13:06] now what does that mean well when we
[13:07] have it opening here at 830 look to the
[13:10] left what do we have we have this High
[13:12] here and we have the low over
[13:17] here we can use this one because they're
[13:19] relative equal but I like this one why
[13:21] why do I like this one what's below it
[13:25] fair value got see that so it's likely a
[13:28] trade down after it creates this sloppy
[13:31] opening look at all this movement in
[13:32] here now as a personal study there's two
[13:38] or three YouTubers that I watch that
[13:39] trade the equities market indices and
[13:44] I'm not trying to say anything bad about
[13:46] them I just like to listen to what
[13:48] they're thinking because they don't look
[13:50] at the market like I do I'm not
[13:53] suggesting that they're not profitable
[13:54] because they show live trades they get
[13:56] into trades they take them and sometimes
[13:58] they win and sometimes they don't but
[14:00] I'd like to read kind of like a a Squawk
[14:04] Box what their interpretation of price
[14:06] is and they're looking at this area in
[14:09] here and
[14:12] it's back and forth they think if it go
[14:14] if it goes here it's going to go there
[14:15] if it goes here if it's going to go
[14:16] there it's all these scenarios are going
[14:18] through you know randomly in their live
[14:22] streams so when I'm watching price I'm
[14:25] listening for them to want to be a buyer
[14:29] so when they're trying to be a buyer
[14:31] that means they're they're already
[14:33] hunting a continuation of this move here
[14:36] I want to see a low
[14:39] form now this is what we have for the
[14:42] today we we start going lower first so
[14:45] that's good we create a pseudo Judas
[14:47] swing but did it create a nice low and
[14:50] turn away from itm look at all this back
[14:53] and forth and it created these suspect
[14:55] lows in here relative equal lows there's
[14:57] going to be sell side building up below
[14:59] that sell stops okay when it starts to
[15:02] go higher anyone that was long overnight
[15:05] they're going to jam their stop loss
[15:07] right underneath
[15:08] that okay when this occurs that's the
[15:12] very scenario I'm looking for now right
[15:15] away in my mind here's what I want you
[15:16] to understand if there's a big move
[15:19] overnight for equities this is not Forex
[15:22] okay this part is not Forex it's just
[15:23] for trading like NASDAQ Dow and e- mini
[15:27] S&P if there a big run
[15:30] overnight avoid the New York session
[15:33] don't even mess with the New York
[15:34] session wait until the other side of
[15:37] lunch at 1:00 in the afternoon New York
[15:39] time and then anticipate the New York
[15:43] lunch lows taken out or the New York
[15:46] morning session lows which is what we
[15:48] have
[15:50] here notice how we rallied up we didn't
[15:53] take out the relative equal highs here
[15:54] that was formed ahead of 7 o'clock in
[15:56] the morning notice that now this over
[15:59] here we know this range up here is the
[16:03] high end of that fair value Gap why do
[16:04] we know that because the 14th stopped
[16:07] trading and it had the indecisive candle
[16:09] in the daily chart so it's likely that
[16:12] we might trade up into this Range High
[16:14] and this is that range low so if we can
[16:17] draw down below that low it was formed
[16:19] initially in New York
[16:21] session we have a fair value Gap over
[16:23] here with sell side while we have yet to
[16:27] take out the buy side theity here
[16:29] at around I don't know
[16:32] 14575 and then get up to that fair value
[16:35] Gap high or the the boundary of it okay
[16:38] kind of like the resistance level of
[16:40] it so this is the draw in liquidity and
[16:43] we have a minor draw in liquidity here
[16:45] with Bice liquidity look what we have in
[16:48] terms of price action the NASDAQ drops
[16:52] down taking out the cell side digging
[16:54] into that fair value Gap see that look
[16:56] at the bodies of the candles isn't that
[16:58] neat how just respects that level back
[17:01] here now that's not random okay these
[17:03] are algorithmic principles that are in
[17:06] play and these markets are unbelievably
[17:09] precise when they are in better
[17:11] conditions right now if you've been
[17:13] trading with live funds or if you've
[17:15] been trying to follow price action
[17:18] there's been a lot of it makes a run
[17:19] then it goes into this choppy sideways
[17:22] and it's very frustrating if you're
[17:23] trying to get like sustained price moves
[17:25] or if you don't know how to operate in
[17:27] these like these sloppy little ranges
[17:29] like this I personally don't think that
[17:32] this is high probability trading you can
[17:33] get chopped up you can get losing trades
[17:36] you can draw your account down if you
[17:38] don't control yourself you can blow your
[17:40] account in these types of conditions how
[17:43] do you avoid that how do you avoid
[17:45] running out your account and then
[17:47] scaling back if you're a high frequency
[17:49] type of a Trader how do you draw back on
[17:51] the frequency and look for the better
[17:53] setups what I'm showing you here you
[17:56] wait you don't chase the overnight run
[17:59] and you wait for them to give you a low
[18:01] that everybody overnight will want to
[18:04] put their stop loss right beneath that
[18:05] after it starts a rally above it it's
[18:08] even better when you don't have this
[18:10] High taken out yet see how I took it up
[18:12] here and it just went right down for him
[18:15] that's engineering
[18:17] liquidity it runs up consolidates
[18:20] creates a low starts to rally and
[18:23] everybody's thinking I don't want to
[18:24] lose my profits I don't want to lose out
[18:27] on making more money but I had to put a
[18:29] stop loss right here because the books
[18:31] tell me I had to do that so I did the
[18:33] same kind of stuff folks I'm not trying
[18:35] to talk down anybody but I'm just
[18:37] repeating what a retail Trader's mindset
[18:40] would be and the logic behind this okay
[18:43] so the narrative with this day was the
[18:46] stocks were trailed below these lows the
[18:49] afternoon session again creates the low
[18:51] of the
[18:52] day takes the sell side liquidity out
[18:55] into a fair value Gap and then rallies
[18:57] now in here I'm going to teach you a
[18:59] little bit more about that
[19:02] watch notice we don't really have a fair
[19:04] value gap down here but it gives us the
[19:06] basis for expecting the price to start
[19:08] to Rally into the afternoon now at 2:00
[19:12] in the afternoon 1,400 on
[19:16] this trading view chart that starts 2
[19:19] o'clock in the afternoon New York local
[19:21] time we have the market trading down
[19:23] into an imbalance over here liquidity
[19:26] resting below these relative equal lows
[19:28] is taken out
[19:29] so what are we looking at we've seen a
[19:31] price run that we don't think needs to
[19:32] come back down here because the logic is
[19:35] the overnight stops have been ran out
[19:36] down here there's no reason for the
[19:37] market to want to come back down there
[19:39] but we have this low and these relative
[19:44] equal lows here Post New York lunch New
[19:47] York lunch is noon to 1:00 in the
[19:49] afternoon New York local
[19:51] time so the imbalance we trade down into
[19:53] that what's the likelihood of it coming
[19:55] all the way through the imbalance and
[19:56] then going after that low not likely not
[19:59] likely not after seeing this run here
[20:02] they don't want to give these Traders
[20:03] another chance to get back in they got
[20:05] stopped out so it's going to be a little
[20:07] bit more sneakier when they make these
[20:09] new setups that continue into a higher
[20:11] run so they take out the sell side below
[20:13] these relative equal lows take those
[20:16] stops out and then it rallies and then
[20:18] drops back down now here watch we have a
[20:21] swing high right here it breaks it does
[20:25] it trade above that yes was it energetic
[20:28] yes does it have a fair value Gap yes so
[20:31] now the market trades down into it here
[20:34] creates a short-term low you could be a
[20:36] buyer there there's nothing wrong with
[20:37] that but say you missed it say you just
[20:39] I mean this is a one minute chart say
[20:40] you missed it and the market starts to
[20:43] run off like this but then it gives you
[20:45] another opportunity I've had many times
[20:47] trades formed just like this where I was
[20:50] looking for something I was waiting for
[20:51] a setup to happen either my cell phone's
[20:55] buzzing or I grab a drink is just
[20:59] outside of reach I got to go walk over
[21:01] to the other end of the desk and grab it
[21:03] and then all of a sudden here you go I
[21:05] miss it takes
[21:06] off the fair value Gap is even better
[21:11] when you have the sell side liquidity
[21:12] resting below short-term
[21:14] low and the drop down into it here you
[21:18] can use that low as your entry or minus
[21:21] one tick okay this short-term low
[21:24] forms at 2:34 p.m. now if you look at
[21:28] the low figure up here that value
[21:31] represents that candle right there so
[21:32] that's why you see it highlighter here
[21:34] when I took a screenshot I'm holding
[21:36] underneath this candle so that way the
[21:38] reference points up here are directly
[21:40] related to this candle so you can see
[21:42] the low is
[21:43] 14528 and a half so you could be a buyer
[21:46] on a limit at
[21:49] 14,520 and a quarter or maybe if you
[21:52] want to try to reach for the you the 28
[21:55] even
[21:56] number either way that's a nice
[21:59] place to put a limit order
[22:01] in the short-term low down here after
[22:05] the fair value Gap forms that's where
[22:07] your stop loss is that's the rules so
[22:10] you have an entry point your stop and
[22:15] between the two of them it works out to
[22:17] be okay let's say you
[22:20] have
[22:22] 14 14 and a
[22:24] quarter in terms of risk okay so 14 and
[22:28] a quarter points or handles of total
[22:31] risk and let's assume that you were
[22:33] trading I don't know six contracts on
[22:35] the
[22:36] micro you're essentially looking
[22:39] at buying and
[22:43] risking
[22:45] $85 to make about
[22:48] $300 so it's about 3.5 to one reward the
[22:54] risk thereabouts I'm roughing I don't
[22:56] have calculator in front of me folks
[22:57] just you do the math
[23:00] now here this value is important because
[23:01] I want you to see in these conditions
[23:04] you can't expect it to be perfect you
[23:06] can't be you know expecting to be in
[23:09] there at the lowest point no draw down
[23:11] no heat on the position and then it just
[23:13] goes in your favor don't think like
[23:15] that you can see on this candle if you
[23:17] would have bought here you would have
[23:19] had nine points of heat okay or
[23:23] basically $54 if you were trading six
[23:27] micros now obviously it goes up more
[23:29] than that if you're trading One Mini
[23:32] because it's
[23:33] $20 per
[23:37] handle but overall this is a nice little
[23:40] setup with the afternoon using the logic
[23:43] over here even though it doesn't give us
[23:45] a fair value Gap the you know the setups
[23:47] that I'm teaching you to use using the
[23:50] fair value Gap afternoon taking the
[23:53] stops it provides the Baseline for bias
[23:57] for the afternoon now what did I teach
[23:59] you here I taught you that you can use
[24:03] these reference points with the
[24:06] underlying sentiment that's already in
[24:09] motion if you didn't trade overnight and
[24:11] take that big run I didn't get any of
[24:13] that run I didn't do anything with that
[24:16] if you miss that it doesn't matter
[24:19] because that is something that's going
[24:20] to give you more insight and it tells
[24:22] you when to avoid the morning session
[24:24] don't trade it everybody's going to be
[24:26] doing what think about it everybody woke
[24:30] up and saw these markets and they all
[24:32] wanted to do what they wanted to buy it
[24:34] because it's going up a lot and they
[24:36] want to chase it that idea leads many
[24:39] times
[24:40] to losing trades and then it's starts
[24:44] this cycle where you go into this
[24:47] chasing chasing chasing and then when
[24:49] the market does these sideways
[24:51] consolidations and sloppy choppy market
[24:54] conditions it it's literally like a
[24:57] blowtorch on your account if you don't
[25:00] know how to stop or if you don't know
[25:01] what you're doing you can literally talk
[25:04] yourself into millions of Trades and
[25:06] then draw your
[25:11] countdown last slide and just to hammer
[25:14] this down this is zoomed in on a one
[25:16] minute
[25:18] chart swing High broken fair value G
[25:22] right there and we have that shortterm
[25:24] low here I'm noted in here so that's
[25:26] where you would be basically entering
[25:27] one with that idea trading below that is
[25:29] where the sell stops are trading below
[25:32] that now it goes below that now some of
[25:34] you have mentioned in the comment
[25:35] section does this invalidate the fair
[25:38] value Gap no it does
[25:40] not the idea is the fair value gaps we
[25:43] look at the look at the body of this
[25:45] candle here isn't that respecting that
[25:48] yes so in my mind I'm thinking well I
[25:50] know prices sometimes especially the way
[25:52] it is right now it's very volatile so
[25:55] I'm permitting a greater level of
[25:58] imperfection in price delivery and
[26:02] then using the logic of the fair value
[26:04] Gap as the basis for my entry idea and
[26:08] then using the stop premise which it
[26:10] didn't get it didn't get here it didn't
[26:12] stop you out you had basically
[26:16] what
[26:19] five what was that five or so uh more
[26:22] handles before you would have been
[26:25] stopped now watching it live might make
[26:27] you look little nervous but at some
[26:30] point folks you're going to have to get
[26:31] used to if you're going to trade like
[26:33] this in these really little time frames
[26:35] and you're trying to be very Nimble
[26:37] you're going to have
[26:38] to learn to trust the setups and let the
[26:42] stops do their jobs and if it if it gets
[26:45] stopped out that's just one trade you
[26:47] got wrong it's not your
[26:49] career look for the next one now I'm
[26:52] going to throw this in here as a bonus
[26:54] but you know take it for what it is it r
[26:58] is here takes off and does not take out
[27:00] that the buy side liquidity resting
[27:02] above here did not get taken here yet
[27:05] and then we had this
[27:07] imbalance and it trades down into it and
[27:10] then hits what the order
[27:11] block that's a buy and you can if you
[27:14] miss this one you can pick up this one
[27:16] based on the logic I teach on the
[27:17] YouTube channel so this is actually
[27:19] something that's taught in the YouTube
[27:20] channel okay uh this whole pattern here
[27:23] is
[27:24] exactly right out of my high probability
[27:27] short-term
[27:29] trading or scalping series I can't
[27:30] remember exactly what the title was but
[27:32] uh this pattern has right in that and
[27:34] then it runs for that liquidity there so
[27:36] there's two setups there so I've took
[27:38] something from the free lessons that's
[27:40] already on the YouTube channel and also
[27:42] amplifying something I've been teaching
[27:43] in this mentorship series hopefully you
[27:46] found this one insightful and until talk
[27:47] to you next time be safe
