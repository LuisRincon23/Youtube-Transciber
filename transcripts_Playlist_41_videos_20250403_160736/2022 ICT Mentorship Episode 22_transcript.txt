[00:04] all right folks welcome back this is
[00:06] the ict mentorship free
[00:09] youtube mentorship
[00:11] for 2022.
[00:14] i hope you're doing well i hope you had
[00:16] a wonderful opportunity to study and
[00:19] learn this week
[00:20] and keeping up with the lessons
[00:22] so we are looking at the e-mini s p
[00:25] daily chart this is june delivery
[00:28] contract month
[00:29] for 2022
[00:31] and i want to kind of like bring you
[00:33] back up to speed to what we were looking
[00:35] for over the last weeks or
[00:37] month or so
[00:39] remember back here we had that bearish
[00:41] order block i outlined that as
[00:44] an area to watch that and we're entering
[00:47] a seasonal tendency so we're going to be
[00:49] expecting lower prices we got lower
[00:51] prices i showed you the relationship
[00:52] between the dollar because it's risk off
[00:56] so we have all the decline
[00:58] taking place in the equities markets
[01:01] and i said that we would be likely to
[01:03] draw down into this
[01:05] relative equal low
[01:08] so i'm going to kind of like do things
[01:10] in the trading view platform
[01:13] so that way some of you folks that are
[01:15] asking questions in the comment section
[01:16] like how do i do this and where is this
[01:18] on the platform
[01:20] admittedly
[01:22] most everything i know about trading
[01:23] view my own students have taught me so
[01:27] there's
[01:29] gonna be a comment posted and pinned by
[01:32] me
[01:33] underneath this video
[01:34] it'll be
[01:35] trading view tips okay
[01:38] if you have a tip that you want to share
[01:40] with the viewers that are new to
[01:42] tradingview
[01:44] please by all means just make a post and
[01:47] outline it as best you can i'm sure
[01:49] they'll be well received i might even
[01:51] learn something too
[01:52] all right so
[01:54] we're looking at
[01:55] how the market did in fact trade down
[01:57] into our relative equal lows so this was
[01:59] the draw on liquidity okay
[02:02] now
[02:03] when i train my students and when new
[02:05] students come to me the first thing they
[02:07] want to know is how to pick the right
[02:09] order block because they know it's one
[02:10] of my concepts they want to know
[02:12] you know which
[02:14] is the entry candle
[02:16] what's the entry point
[02:18] where do i get in at okay
[02:20] and that's the easiest thing
[02:24] out of all the learning okay
[02:28] once you understand what the market's
[02:29] likely to do where it's going to draw to
[02:32] okay where is it going
[02:34] why should it get there
[02:35] okay
[02:37] if you do majority of your studying
[02:40] and watching the tape okay reading the
[02:42] tape which is kind of like what i'm
[02:44] gonna outline and showcase in the live
[02:46] streams in may
[02:48] uh just before i get any further in this
[02:51] conversation
[02:53] the live streams will only be
[02:56] in may i'm not trying to make a ongoing
[03:00] thing of this
[03:01] i don't want to
[03:03] promise you you know an ongoing thing
[03:06] but i am going to showcase some things
[03:08] in live sessions that way you can see
[03:11] how to train yourself to look for these
[03:13] things okay i will not be giving you
[03:16] trade recommendations okay i will not be
[03:18] entering trades in front of you i'm
[03:20] going to be outlining basically what you
[03:21] saw me do
[03:23] in this mentorship outlining where this
[03:24] is going to go and it went there
[03:28] i'm going to be doing that with intraday
[03:29] charts
[03:30] okay and i'm gonna point out certain
[03:32] areas to study watch how price reacts
[03:34] right here
[03:36] and look for this type of thing to occur
[03:38] here because i want you to understand
[03:40] what it's doing
[03:42] why is it likely to do what i'm gonna
[03:44] outline okay
[03:46] the best thing that can happen is for me
[03:49] to get it wrong sometimes
[03:50] okay so that way it'll disarm you
[03:53] it'll feel like okay well you know if i
[03:56] don't get it right
[03:59] ict himself didn't get it right here or
[04:01] there okay so
[04:02] i'm going to do my best obviously to try
[04:04] to educate you and show you what i think
[04:06] is going to happen but invariably
[04:09] there's
[04:10] instances it's going to creep in it's
[04:12] not going to be accurate okay i'm going
[04:13] to read it wrong and it's fine
[04:16] do not
[04:17] do not
[04:19] take what i'm saying in my commentaries
[04:21] and or my opinions
[04:24] over the chart that's going to be live
[04:26] don't take that as trade advice do not
[04:29] take a trade and i'm going to say this
[04:30] every single time i do the live stream
[04:34] don't act on it because you don't know
[04:35] what i'm doing
[04:37] you don't know what i'm viewing you
[04:38] don't know what i'm trying to teach you
[04:41] none of that okay so you want to sit
[04:43] still and just observe and take notes
[04:45] they will be recorded
[04:47] they will be on the youtube channel for
[04:49] those individuals that are not going to
[04:51] be able to be present
[04:52] when will those live streams take place
[04:56] there will be a new york session between
[04:59] i think i'll start around eight o'clock
[05:01] in the morning
[05:02] so that way we can
[05:04] get the chart set up i'll give you my
[05:06] views overnight what took place and what
[05:09] i think that cannot counter may present
[05:11] and kind of like build the mindset i
[05:13] will not be talking in the chat room
[05:15] okay the little chat thing on the side
[05:17] you know
[05:18] you guys will be saying whatever you
[05:19] want to say i don't care i'm not going
[05:21] to be looking at that because it'll be a
[05:23] distraction the agenda that i have for
[05:26] that particular day it would be very
[05:28] distracting for me to
[05:30] to read comments and questions
[05:32] and
[05:33] because i know your question is
[05:35] important to you all of you no matter
[05:37] how simple it may be
[05:39] i'll feel compelled to want to answer
[05:41] everything that flashes across the
[05:42] screen and it'll disrupt my
[05:44] concentration so i won't be looking at
[05:46] the chat okay
[05:49] i'm not ignoring everybody
[05:51] for the sake of being rude i'm just
[05:52] ignoring everybody so i can stay on task
[05:55] okay so
[05:56] there's that
[05:57] but we'll begin around eight o'clock in
[05:58] the morning
[05:59] and we'll close it
[06:02] you know whenever i feel
[06:04] the need to do so but i'll be willing to
[06:07] go up to
[06:09] 10 30 11 o'clock okay which is a very
[06:11] long long session i know
[06:14] they may not all go that way i won't be
[06:15] doing it every day either so it'll be a
[06:18] hand-picked selected day in advance that
[06:20] you'll know about
[06:22] and i'll post it
[06:24] on the community tab on my youtube
[06:25] channel okay
[06:27] all right with all that stuff out of the
[06:29] way let's get back into the nitty gritty
[06:31] here
[06:32] so i outlined this area here in this low
[06:36] and i said this would be the draw on
[06:37] liquidity so
[06:39] when you're on
[06:40] trading view over here there's a little
[06:43] segment where you can have
[06:45] a choice of certain things
[06:47] now you can do
[06:49] this so it looks like this is your your
[06:51] bullseye where the market's gonna draw
[06:53] to you're aiming for that in other words
[06:57] or you can use the little magnet icon i
[06:59] teach with that analogy like up here
[07:03] imagine an
[07:04] you know a magnet of some kind
[07:06] down here and price is going to be drawn
[07:09] down to that level here
[07:11] so this is where the liquidity was
[07:14] and they tapped into it today
[07:16] all right
[07:17] you knew about it up here
[07:19] you knew about the order block up here
[07:21] you knew about the seasonal tendency on
[07:22] that line
[07:23] and we have
[07:25] this really nice decline here
[07:27] so i want to take you into the
[07:29] marketplace
[07:31] and strip this down a little bit
[07:35] and give you some more details so we're
[07:37] going to the hourly chart
[07:52] this is why i do powerpoint slides it's
[07:54] really easy to get to where i wanted to
[07:56] be
[07:57] all right so we had a run
[08:00] here
[08:01] yesterday just kept pumping higher
[08:03] higher higher
[08:05] just fell short of this high
[08:07] and then so we had a decline and then
[08:09] the normal pause and then gapped it down
[08:13] then rallied it back up
[08:15] so between this candle's low
[08:18] and this candle's opening
[08:20] right in here that's an imbalance
[08:23] coupled with an actual gap
[08:26] so i want you to take a look at that
[08:40] okay
[08:41] now
[08:42] we have this candle here small little
[08:44] piece of that one here
[08:46] this one this one this one and this one
[08:49] they go just above
[08:51] that area here this is permissible price
[08:54] action in other words this is something
[08:55] you have to get used to
[08:57] okay
[08:59] look at the bodies of the candle
[09:02] see how they're staying inside
[09:04] of that imbalance
[09:06] it reaches for liquidity and stops
[09:10] on these wicks
[09:12] but the bulk of the volume is being held
[09:16] inside this imbalance
[09:18] notice that
[09:20] so now we have
[09:22] the market release go to the downside
[09:25] and then here is
[09:27] nine o'clock in the morning
[09:30] i want to go into 8 30 actually let's go
[09:32] down to a
[09:35] 15-inch chart
[09:38] so here's 930
[09:40] that opening price
[09:43] here
[09:45] at 9 30 what's actually happening is the
[09:47] equities are
[09:48] opening up the stock market
[09:50] starts trading that's when you hear the
[09:52] bell ding ding you know sudden
[09:53] everybody's clapping their hands on tv
[09:55] whatever that's what's occurring here
[09:57] it's opening
[09:58] so it's running a short term
[10:00] high
[10:01] right here
[10:03] and then
[10:04] breaks lower
[10:06] creates an imbalance here
[10:08] so on the 15 minute time frame what do
[10:10] we see
[10:12] did it take a high out yes
[10:16] did it break below low yes was it
[10:18] displacement yes it was energetic did we
[10:21] trade back up into it here yes so in
[10:23] here you could be a seller
[10:25] and get in sync with the run to try to
[10:27] get positioned for if you are a swing
[10:29] trader or short term trader this could
[10:31] be your entry and an aim for that old
[10:34] relative equal law which is that blue
[10:36] line here remember the two equal lows on
[10:38] the daily chart i drew a line on that's
[10:40] what this is here okay and it ran down
[10:42] into it today
[10:47] at 8 30
[10:53] right there we're using the opening
[10:55] price
[11:03] did price trade above it yes it's in a
[11:05] premium
[11:06] it's above an old high that makes it a
[11:08] premium too
[11:09] i saw i believe it was a young lady
[11:13] and i apologize i don't recall and i
[11:16] didn't make a note of your name so
[11:17] please don't be offended but i know i
[11:19] saw it where it was saying something to
[11:21] the effect that
[11:24] you don't understand
[11:25] how it could be in a premium
[11:27] because it's above an old high
[11:30] any time the market trades above
[11:34] an old high
[11:36] that is a short-term premium
[11:38] because it's going into liquidity
[11:41] any time the market trades below
[11:43] an old low
[11:45] that's a discount
[11:46] okay
[11:47] now just like
[11:49] the purposes of what people use
[11:51] overbought oversold indicators
[11:54] things can be overbought and still go
[11:55] higher
[11:56] things can be oversold or in a discount
[11:59] and keep going lower okay see that's why
[12:02] i'm suggesting that when people are
[12:04] studying price they can't just assume
[12:08] that an indicator is overbought so
[12:12] therefore
[12:13] it's a good sell or a shorting
[12:15] opportunity it's not always
[12:17] but if you understand the narrative
[12:20] within market structure market structure
[12:23] is not the answer
[12:24] it helps you frame an idea but the idea
[12:28] must be in alignment with the present
[12:30] narrative narrative is why should the
[12:32] market go where you think it's going to
[12:33] go
[12:34] on that particular day
[12:36] based on the climate the economic
[12:38] calendar events and the volatility
[12:41] that's being offered for that particular
[12:43] trading session or day
[12:45] so these are all things that you're
[12:46] going to need to study and i teach on
[12:49] this youtube channel and i'll teach a
[12:51] little bit more when we're doing a live
[12:52] session because it'll be more practical
[12:53] then so that way you're over my shoulder
[12:55] you're looking at it just like i'm
[12:56] looking at it and i'll give you my
[12:58] internal dialogue and kind of like what
[13:00] i'm thinking
[13:01] that is the most salient at the moment
[13:03] so that way your attention is on the
[13:04] right things at the right time
[13:07] but
[13:08] power three
[13:09] which is the
[13:11] open
[13:13] rally up or manipulation creating the
[13:15] high
[13:16] and then
[13:18] the movement lower and then distribute
[13:21] their shorts below
[13:23] an area where there would be stops so
[13:26] smart money would be selling short the
[13:28] buy stops here
[13:29] writing this out
[13:31] and an
[13:32] offloading
[13:34] their shorts
[13:35] to sell stops below those relative equal
[13:37] lows
[13:40] remember when we see those relative
[13:41] equal lows on the daily chart
[13:42] traders are going to look at that as a
[13:44] breakout
[13:46] there's lots of traders out there that
[13:47] have long-term trend following systems
[13:49] and models
[13:50] and if it breaks below those areas they
[13:52] want to be short so that's going to
[13:53] flood the market with what
[13:56] market orders to sell at the market
[13:59] well that's a perfect counterpart to
[14:01] smart money being short up here because
[14:03] they want to buy it at a lower price
[14:06] and while up here they're aiming down
[14:08] here is it hard to believe that when we
[14:09] were already outlining that last week
[14:12] in the week before
[14:14] no
[14:15] we have visibility we have the ability
[14:17] to forecast certain things that should
[14:19] repeat
[14:21] if the algorithm is in fact in control
[14:24] and we understand what the algorithm is
[14:26] doing
[14:26] and i'm suggesting that my experience
[14:28] should indicate that we have that
[14:32] does it deliver here it is
[14:35] okay so
[14:37] you're taking the logic of certain
[14:39] principles and concepts and blending
[14:42] them with market structure we're looking
[14:44] for lower prices it should reach for a
[14:46] specific low but also how does the
[14:48] present narrative
[14:50] allow for engagement with the daily
[14:53] range or power three
[14:55] everything i've taught you
[14:57] so it's the open
[14:59] rally
[15:01] smart money enters near the high today
[15:02] above the opening
[15:04] and they get out down here
[15:06] at an important low
[15:08] and the market closes near the level of
[15:10] the day
[15:13] let's go into a
[15:16] five-minute chart
[15:22] one
[15:23] two relative equal highs you see that
[15:26] now if you're looking at the lower time
[15:28] frame charts let me get this off here
[15:29] because it's no longer
[15:30] useful
[15:33] if you're looking at that like that
[15:34] here's the opening price you know
[15:36] there's what resting above that
[15:38] buy side so buy stops or buy sell
[15:41] liquidity is resting here
[15:43] so it can run up
[15:45] and just to the left of that also you
[15:47] see these highs here they're real close
[15:49] to one another too so for good measure
[15:51] they might want to come up here and
[15:52] clean that out
[15:53] this is a little too much i think it's
[15:55] too rich for the expectation to get to
[15:57] that high
[15:58] but in here is reasonable but here at
[16:00] least
[16:01] okay
[16:03] mark punches up through yes it does take
[16:05] those out
[16:08] then it breaks down comes one more time
[16:10] back above the opening price and then
[16:12] gives up the ghost and aggressively runs
[16:14] for the sell side below here
[16:16] now for some of you that would be enough
[16:20] getting short up here buying it back
[16:22] below the lows and being done and
[16:23] walking away
[16:25] there's nothing wrong with that if
[16:26] that's your model
[16:27] but we're going to take a closer look
[16:29] inside of this area here
[16:31] and see what we see
[16:39] all right let's drop down into i'm just
[16:40] gonna go right to the one minute chart
[16:43] just to save time
[16:58] all right
[16:59] so we have
[17:04] in this area
[17:05] where the market ran above those
[17:06] relative equal highs
[17:11] here they are here
[17:13] the market runs up
[17:16] then it breaks down right here
[17:21] see that right there that's a swing low
[17:25] breaks below it was it displacement yes
[17:29] does it mark come back up into this
[17:30] little area here yes is it about the
[17:33] opening price yes
[17:35] is that enough sure it is
[17:37] you can be short there
[17:39] you have to weather this one more run up
[17:41] into your
[17:43] entry and you may have a little bit of a
[17:45] down
[17:46] but your stop loss if you're entering in
[17:47] this fair value got your stop has to be
[17:49] above the very minimum
[17:51] the candle that creates the
[17:53] fair value gap that's here so your style
[17:55] is going to be above that
[17:58] for good measure you know conservative
[18:00] up here
[18:02] oh but ict that's a lot that's a big
[18:04] stop
[18:05] well look how volatile it is you want to
[18:07] be knocked out of the trade prematurely
[18:09] or are you just concerned about making
[18:11] the maximum amount of money on your
[18:13] trade
[18:14] dismissing the level of risk
[18:17] that's
[18:18] what gamblers do
[18:19] i'm not trying to teach gambling
[18:22] so when you're practicing on your demo
[18:24] account keep that in mind that way
[18:26] you're not trying to overextend yourself
[18:30] the sell side below these lows in here
[18:32] after it hits the fairway you got here
[18:34] and one more time into it
[18:36] well the opening price it breaks lower
[18:39] and aggressively runs below here so not
[18:42] a bad little run there
[18:44] let's go back up to a five minute chart
[18:49] okay and we're gonna go look at the
[18:51] afternoon session
[18:53] here is 1 135 and i remember i stated at
[18:58] around 1 30 that's when i like to go
[19:00] back in now i've taken trades earlier
[19:02] than that but i'd like to see 1 30.
[19:05] after 1 30 the lunch hour
[19:08] has been smoothed out and then there's
[19:10] usually some kind of a
[19:11] retracement higher when it's bearish or
[19:13] retracement lower when it's bullish
[19:15] and you're seeing that here
[19:18] the imbalance
[19:19] relative equal highs
[19:21] it runs up into that right there that's
[19:23] an area you can get short on
[19:26] market delivers a run lower
[19:29] here's another little fair value gap in
[19:30] there
[19:31] it runs up into that
[19:33] that's a short aiming for what
[19:36] that line here that's that relative
[19:38] equal low
[19:39] on the daily chart
[19:41] so
[19:42] today huge huge opportunity day lots of
[19:47] points that could have been uh made
[19:49] available
[19:50] but i did something this morning
[19:53] showing everyone kind of like what
[19:55] reading the tape
[19:58] examples will be like when i'm doing the
[20:00] live session
[20:02] i did some executions just to prove
[20:04] visibility to prove i was expecting a
[20:06] certain run
[20:08] and
[20:10] i believe i was on nasa yeah i was in
[20:12] the nasdaq so
[20:14] let's go over to nasdaq
[20:22] okay
[20:24] that's in here
[20:26] so we're going to zoom in here on this
[20:27] bit of business
[20:45] all right and here is what i had in mind
[20:48] when i was looking at the chart
[20:50] woke up this morning
[20:56] my wife is out of town
[20:58] with my daughter
[21:00] so i woke up and
[21:03] just because you know creature habit
[21:05] your spouse ain't next to you so i had
[21:08] insomnia so i sat up and i was looking
[21:10] at the charts and said well you know
[21:11] what
[21:12] i see
[21:13] well let me ask you what you see before
[21:15] i do it okay
[21:17] what gave me the backdrop for all this
[21:20] in here
[21:22] which i'll explain in detail in a moment
[21:23] but what gave me the realization that
[21:25] this is likely to
[21:27] turn here and go lower
[21:28] studied the entire fractal that's being
[21:30] shown okay
[21:32] pause the video
[21:38] some of you just refuse i'm never going
[21:40] to do it i see steve stop asking me to
[21:42] do it all right so
[21:44] we had this high here
[21:46] we ran above it
[21:48] and then we had the market shift so buy
[21:50] stops
[21:52] taken
[21:54] breakout artist taking in on the market
[21:55] long
[21:56] and then relative equal lows
[21:59] broken
[22:00] so we have a shift in market structure
[22:02] on a five-minute chart
[22:04] in a time when it's bearish we're
[22:06] looking for those relative equal lows to
[22:07] be tagged on the s p and this is not the
[22:10] s p i understand that but the
[22:12] expectation is we want to see these two
[22:14] indices go down on the daily chart so
[22:17] heaviness should be the
[22:18] you know the
[22:21] protocol going into our trading day
[22:24] in here
[22:26] we have what
[22:28] displacement
[22:30] below
[22:32] these lows so there's a lot of energy
[22:33] there so right above that what do we
[22:35] have fair value got
[22:37] oh there's one right here too
[22:39] right what did i teach you
[22:41] this is where you do your entry
[22:46] but i t you didn't enter here right i
[22:49] wasn't looking at the chart yet i'll get
[22:50] to that
[22:52] he's in my mind he can read my mind
[22:55] this fair value got here
[22:57] we expect that to stab up into it
[23:01] so our stop has to at least be in a
[23:03] position where it can weather that
[23:05] so
[23:07] what does that mean
[23:08] that means that you have to either have
[23:10] deep pockets and allow for your
[23:12] stop-loss to be inside this
[23:14] here
[23:16] or
[23:17] you use
[23:19] the micros
[23:20] which is fine um i don't want to do a
[23:23] micro man i want to be in there 20 per
[23:25] point
[23:26] okay
[23:27] but you have to have an account that
[23:29] will allow for that if you don't have
[23:31] that then trade the micro
[23:33] but i don't want to do that okay
[23:36] gamble
[23:37] but not because i taught you to do that
[23:40] so here is the
[23:41] order flow inside of that fair value gap
[23:43] here again a little bit of
[23:47] extra runs above
[23:49] into that fair but you got there i'll
[23:52] put another rectangle so you can get a
[23:53] visual representation of what i mean by
[23:55] that i mean you can clearly see it
[23:56] obviously but
[23:57] i want you to just
[23:58] see it by contrast
[24:02] see this is the rules this is why i've
[24:03] been teaching you okay
[24:06] if there is only one fair value you got
[24:07] then you just put your
[24:09] entry there and you don't expect it to
[24:11] go up into any deeper retracement but
[24:13] because it has another one here
[24:15] expect it to stab up into that now i
[24:17] know some of you in here want to be an
[24:19] ict junior and you want to be in there
[24:22] on the highest candle when you're
[24:23] selling you want to be on the lowest
[24:24] camera when you're buying and i
[24:26] understand
[24:28] but this isn't always going to happen
[24:31] so if you're really only trying to aim
[24:33] for that you're going to miss moves and
[24:35] if it moves like it did today
[24:37] that's that's a heartbreaker
[24:39] because it moved a lot
[24:41] and if you weren't positioned in it
[24:43] and you spent the rest of the day
[24:45] kicking yourself without being greedy
[24:47] about trying to get that instead of
[24:48] where i've already taught you
[24:50] you'll probably miss the other moves
[24:52] that take place later in the afternoon
[24:54] and you get nothing for the day
[24:56] all right so anyway
[24:57] so we had a shift in market structure we
[24:59] move up into a fair value gap here
[25:02] and we have a break lower
[25:04] fair value gap here
[25:07] relative equal lows now look real close
[25:08] folks okay
[25:10] relative equal lows
[25:12] a high being taken here we break down
[25:16] these two candles move right below here
[25:19] that's the same thing as these two
[25:20] candles here being broken with this move
[25:22] here it's a fractal
[25:24] this whole move here
[25:26] is the same thing here
[25:28] just smaller and it creates the same
[25:31] thing the fair value gap here the market
[25:33] trades up into it the body's kind of
[25:35] exp you know respecting that little area
[25:38] moves a little bit above it that's fine
[25:40] but then
[25:41] breaks aggressively lower
[25:43] does it take out the low yet no
[25:47] retraces up in now i have two
[25:50] okay not one i have two
[25:54] narratives in play this one here
[25:57] where we have a shift in market
[25:58] structure there
[25:59] so this is a long term high
[26:02] here we have another
[26:07] break lower it would imbalance so it's
[26:09] an enemy term high
[26:11] this is a bigger one than that one right
[26:13] so this is a long term high
[26:16] intermediate term high by definition
[26:18] they're both enemy and term highs
[26:19] because they have imbalances
[26:21] but this one is lower than this one and
[26:24] this over here
[26:26] is lower than that one so this is a
[26:27] turning point making this by
[26:30] the hierarchy of swing points and marker
[26:32] structure this is a long term high
[26:36] energy term intermediate term because of
[26:39] the imbalance
[26:41] but how they nest together for market
[26:43] structure
[26:44] long-term
[26:45] immediate term
[26:46] now when this is retracing up this is
[26:48] going to be a short-term high
[26:50] inside of a market structure that is
[26:54] really predisposed to go lower because
[26:55] we have long term and intermittent term
[26:58] above me
[27:00] this
[27:01] should respect
[27:03] the underlying order flow and go lower
[27:06] and i'm looking for that lower price
[27:09] that's below
[27:10] here
[27:11] there's cell stops resting below that
[27:14] so as it retraces back up into this up
[27:16] closed candle what is this up close
[27:17] candle
[27:20] pay a shorter block
[27:23] that's not what you've been teaching
[27:24] this michael on this model right
[27:26] i didn't say that's what this was i'm
[27:27] telling you how to read the tape okay
[27:30] but i do teach order blocks on
[27:32] the channel
[27:35] so we're gonna go into
[27:38] this
[27:44] right here
[27:45] so inside this shaded area this is what
[27:47] i'm going to be executing in
[27:50] not what that color i am
[27:54] okay that's good enough
[27:55] may not be your choice but it's mine now
[27:57] all right so we're going to drop into a
[28:00] one minute chart
[28:10] every time i do this i always imagine
[28:13] somebody that has a little bit better
[28:14] understanding how to work with the
[28:16] tradingview
[28:18] platform
[28:19] they probably have a whole lot easier
[28:21] quicker way of getting to where i'm
[28:22] trying to get to
[28:25] sorry
[28:26] all right so
[28:28] we're inside of that blue shaded area
[28:32] on the five-minute chart
[28:35] i'm also inside of this
[28:38] green candle here that's a bullish order
[28:39] block
[28:40] so what i'm doing is now i'm going to
[28:42] calibrate
[28:44] which just meant simply means i'm going
[28:45] to go down and
[28:47] with a top down analysis approach refine
[28:50] that order block that was on a five
[28:51] minute down to this one
[28:53] so the market retreats back up into
[28:56] here
[28:58] into that order block and i'm i'm trying
[29:00] to aim once it hits the midpoint of it
[29:02] i want to get in around that time
[29:04] okay so i'm entering there on that
[29:06] candle and then i'm holding in all this
[29:09] and it drops back down
[29:11] now some of you might look at this and
[29:12] say oh but this is that order block fair
[29:15] value gap here
[29:17] and
[29:19] what happens if it rallies well it does
[29:20] a little bit
[29:21] but what's it subordinate to
[29:23] all the things i outlined over here and
[29:25] on the five minute chart over here with
[29:27] a higher
[29:28] swing high so the market structure is
[29:30] bearish i'm not looking at this setup
[29:32] this is why i'm telling you
[29:35] i tell this all the time okay is
[29:39] me teaching my order block theory me
[29:41] teaching my fair value got concept
[29:44] is it going to become
[29:47] ineffective
[29:48] no
[29:49] because
[29:50] number one it takes a lot of discipline
[29:52] you have to be absolutely organized you
[29:55] have to know what you're doing
[29:56] and that's why a lot of people just
[29:58] teach it from hindsight because they
[30:00] can't really they can't really do it
[30:02] so you can sound real smart
[30:04] you can sound real educated and in you
[30:06] know institutional quote unquote
[30:09] but if they can't do it it's useless
[30:12] so if
[30:14] i'm showing you these things and i'm
[30:17] telling you also look around majority of
[30:19] the people that parrot what i teach that
[30:22] means they're mimicking by saying what
[30:23] is i already said like an echo but
[30:25] they're really not doing it they're not
[30:27] doing it like i'm able to do with it
[30:32] that should be your comfort
[30:34] that
[30:36] people by far and large humans are lazy
[30:39] creatures okay they're lazy
[30:41] and they're not going to be
[30:43] predominantly
[30:47] rule-based
[30:48] disciplined
[30:49] responsible
[30:51] they're gonna be lazy and they're not
[30:52] gonna do what's supposed to be done
[30:54] so
[30:56] it won't change anything
[30:58] okay it won't make these things
[31:00] inferior it won't change their
[31:02] superiority it will not make them
[31:04] ineffective
[31:05] they will remain constant
[31:08] now the algorithm
[31:10] i don't care how many people learn from
[31:11] this youtube channel okay i don't care
[31:14] how many people rip me off and try to
[31:15] rebrand and change the name of
[31:17] everything i've taught
[31:20] all of that saturation will not change
[31:23] because
[31:24] what i just said
[31:25] the algorithm isn't going to change
[31:27] there's new suckers coming in all the
[31:29] time
[31:30] pt barnum said it really really
[31:32] accurately
[31:33] there's a sucker born every second
[31:37] so they're you're never going to run out
[31:39] of liquidity
[31:40] somebody's born somebody gets old enough
[31:42] to start speculating and trading
[31:45] boom they're in the marketplace and that
[31:47] liquidity will just add to
[31:49] the liquidity that will be on the other
[31:51] side of your tree
[31:52] so there's no reason for you to be
[31:54] worrying about whether or not this is
[31:55] going to be in effect i've been teaching
[31:57] this for a long time okay privately
[32:01] and
[32:02] listen
[32:03] if i honestly believed in my heart of
[32:05] hearts that this would fail
[32:07] and stop working if i taught it i would
[32:09] not teach it
[32:11] i wouldn't i would have never even
[32:12] mentioned it
[32:14] and i'm being honest
[32:16] so
[32:18] take heart there's no reason for you to
[32:19] be upset about or worried or concerned
[32:22] it will remain as long as those markets
[32:23] are
[32:24] trading
[32:25] these elements will be in these markets
[32:28] there it is
[32:30] all right so
[32:32] the market rallies up it's stats above
[32:34] the order block here but it's just the
[32:36] wick see that the bulk of the volume and
[32:38] the bodies of the candles are inside
[32:40] that order block
[32:42] then the market does what it breaks
[32:44] and shows displacement here
[32:46] remember what i said about this pattern
[32:48] here
[32:49] relative equal lows it breaks down and
[32:51] it goes back to a fair value got
[32:54] here it is again relative equal lows
[32:57] displacement
[32:58] fair value got what does it do go right
[33:00] back up into what the fair value got end
[33:02] and
[33:03] look closely
[33:06] at the bottom of the bearish shoulder
[33:07] block
[33:09] see that
[33:10] bam hits it
[33:12] you watch me looking at the chart
[33:14] it's there and then i'm entering on that
[33:16] candle i'm not entering it because i
[33:18] wasn't really looking at the screen it's
[33:20] a second when i was
[33:22] i was
[33:23] holding the phone this morning but i
[33:25] wasn't looking at it here because this
[33:26] is a one-minute chart and i was doing
[33:27] something else and when i looked back at
[33:29] the screen i seen it went up there and
[33:30] hit it and after it filled it then i put
[33:32] my
[33:33] market over to go in and sell two i sold
[33:36] three contracts here
[33:38] i sold two contracts here
[33:40] and then i entered again here
[33:43] after it did what
[33:44] retraded back up into this bearish order
[33:46] block here so it moved down
[33:48] came back up in
[33:50] and i'm selling short here
[33:53] there
[33:54] okay
[33:55] what's the low on that candle
[34:00] right here
[34:02] look at this figure right
[34:04] there so 13 334 and three quarters
[34:09] and my entry as it ran up into it on
[34:12] this candle
[34:13] the entry was thirteen thousand three
[34:15] thirty five
[34:16] so it was only a quarter of a point
[34:19] above into that candle that was my entry
[34:23] it had a little bit of heat here
[34:25] so on that entry it was one contract
[34:28] here so notice what i'm doing
[34:30] i'm entering at the largest portion of
[34:33] the setup or you know the framework for
[34:35] the trade i'm going in with my maximum
[34:37] position size
[34:38] first three contracts
[34:40] there
[34:42] then selling two
[34:44] here
[34:45] and then i'm adding the last one here
[34:47] at logical precise areas it's not
[34:50] randomness it's not willy-nilly it's
[34:52] this not flipping a coin it's not
[34:55] guessing there's logic here okay
[34:58] so
[35:02] when the market has this heat on it here
[35:04] the highest
[35:06] value that candle goes to is
[35:09] thirteen thousand three hundred and
[35:10] thirty nine and a half so four and a
[35:13] half
[35:14] handles that's the heat i took on
[35:16] that there but only on one contract
[35:19] okay
[35:20] because i have two contracts that i'm
[35:22] short from back here
[35:23] and i have three contracts short from
[35:25] over here
[35:26] so i have all this built in equity with
[35:30] five contracts so the one contract here
[35:32] that only has four and a half
[35:35] points of heat on it or draw down it's
[35:37] insignificant i don't even worry about
[35:39] i'm not thinking about it and that's why
[35:40] i
[35:41] when i pyramid and i build in large
[35:42] positions i'm starting with my biggest
[35:45] position first and then i'm going
[35:46] smaller and smaller until i can't do any
[35:48] smaller
[35:50] i don't ever do
[35:51] the final one contract and do one more
[35:53] and one more and one more i don't do
[35:54] that that's i don't need to do that so
[35:59] once i had that position established
[36:03] then i submitted to the idea
[36:05] of it going down to that level that i
[36:07] drew out on the i forgot what time frame
[36:11] was now but we'll draw back out in a
[36:13] second but here is the exit here i
[36:14] bought all six back
[36:16] at 13285 even
[36:19] i want to be just above the level
[36:22] because
[36:23] it might do these little shallow runs
[36:26] and it might not give me my fill
[36:28] it does a little bit of that in here
[36:31] and then finally
[36:32] digs a little bit deeper
[36:35] i just thought i had to wait a little
[36:36] bit longer to get the fill but it
[36:38] happened right there and i posted on the
[36:39] community tab when it happened boom and
[36:41] showed you the little screenshot there
[36:42] it is
[36:44] now
[36:45] that's reading the tape that is reading
[36:49] the market that's
[36:50] getting
[36:57] familiar with
[36:59] order flow
[37:02] and for those of you that are students
[37:05] of mine for a longer time than just
[37:07] recently you recognize this
[37:10] as a market maker cell model
[37:12] so i was selling in an area where
[37:14] distribution would take place
[37:17] so all this stuff is there it's logic
[37:21] i'm going to say this point
[37:23] because i know there's people out there
[37:25] going through my trade statements
[37:27] and you're looking for
[37:29] precision
[37:30] uh there's a lot of things that i'm
[37:31] doing in that state in those statements
[37:33] that have nothing to do with trying to
[37:36] be precise you guys wanted to see an
[37:38] account go up i i provided that i also
[37:41] provided a way for my students they were
[37:43] asking me that i'm obligated to
[37:46] to show them where if they went into a
[37:48] period of drawdown how they fix it and
[37:51] also had lots of questions like and i
[37:53] did it this morning with let me see
[37:55] where was the entry yet the second one
[37:57] where i did two contracts right there
[38:00] okay
[38:01] when i did that one
[38:02] it was after i did
[38:06] the
[38:07] or was it let me go back and
[38:10] well does that make a difference the one
[38:12] where i had the fair value gap i said i
[38:13] didn't see it when it was forming and
[38:15] filling it in
[38:17] after it filled it it was still close to
[38:19] it so it was a close proximity entry
[38:21] a lot of the trades in that td
[38:23] ameritrade account i'm using close
[38:26] proximity entries and i'm also
[38:29] using things that you don't know about
[38:31] okay
[38:32] i'm also
[38:33] proving to some of my students where if
[38:36] they got into a marketplace and they
[38:38] take a trade
[38:40] and
[38:41] they don't get stopped out but they sit
[38:43] through draw down how the weather that
[38:45] you are not privy to the conversations
[38:47] i'm having with these students so don't
[38:49] assume that
[38:50] you're looking at those statements
[38:51] thinking oh this is this is all he's got
[38:53] that's not all i got i'm actually
[38:55] doing something else i hear somebody out
[38:57] there talking saying they can do things
[38:59] and i can't trade and i'm baiting them
[39:02] i want them to step out but they won't
[39:05] okay
[39:06] i want them to think that that's all i
[39:08] could do and even then they wouldn't
[39:10] butts because he knows i can do better
[39:12] than that this is this
[39:14] is not even the best there's other
[39:16] things you can do with my concepts right
[39:18] from this youtube channel that's more
[39:20] precise than this
[39:22] i know it sounds hard to believe but it
[39:24] is what it is
[39:26] i don't want those statements that i was
[39:28] sharing
[39:29] because like everything else of mine
[39:31] people take my stuff remove my name
[39:34] rebrand it and they say you know this is
[39:36] my stuff this is my creation this is
[39:38] whatever and they sell and they scam
[39:41] if i give statements
[39:43] that have real time and sales with live
[39:46] account
[39:47] and i'm producing like you see here
[39:51] is it hard to imagine someone taking
[39:52] that and showing it to people and saying
[39:54] that's their results and scamming them
[39:58] think about it folks
[40:00] everything i do there's a rhyming reason
[40:01] for it i'm not
[40:03] reacting to someone else's
[40:07] negative discord
[40:08] so today this is the last bit of
[40:11] business here
[40:13] and we're done
[40:15] so i did all this overnight going into
[40:18] a pre-new york session
[40:20] then we had all this back and forth
[40:23] they pumped it up over
[40:25] the overnight high here
[40:29] and then we go back into that discussion
[40:31] we had earlier
[40:32] so they ran the high here
[40:34] with this run up
[40:37] and at 9 30 that's when we expect that
[40:39] volatility to come in and that's right
[40:41] here okay so a little bit of whipsaw in
[40:43] here boom rallies
[40:46] in my live trading account
[40:48] i took a long in here and i got out at
[40:50] uh i think it was
[40:53] 13 409
[40:55] i wanted 13 4
[40:57] 25
[40:58] but i was a little apprehensive thinking
[41:00] that they may not stab through it they
[41:01] were getting real close to it and it's
[41:03] hung around
[41:05] and i got out just a little bit
[41:07] prematurely and that was it and i didn't
[41:10] take anything until later on the
[41:11] afternoon so a small little scalp in
[41:12] here
[41:13] made about 740 bucks i think it was and
[41:17] uh
[41:18] that was it my attention diverted
[41:20] because
[41:21] i'm mr mom right now not my wife's not
[41:23] with me and the two children i have that
[41:26] live with us still
[41:27] i'm
[41:28] in charge of homeschooling them still
[41:30] and running this business and i have two
[41:33] boxers that are
[41:34] highly demanding of my time and i know
[41:36] some of you are saying get to the point
[41:38] get your point the point is i'm a real
[41:39] person okay so i'm not able to be in
[41:42] every single move because i'm doing
[41:44] other things and i have a life i know it
[41:46] seems like i probably don't but i really
[41:48] do and as introverted as it is and is as
[41:51] simple as it is
[41:53] i love my life and i like doing the
[41:54] things i like doing in my life but the
[41:57] markets are not everything in my life
[42:00] but hopefully you got something out of
[42:02] this and you can see how we did again
[42:04] uh draw lower on nasdaq
[42:07] and
[42:10] i think that will be it for
[42:14] this one i'm going to go back to e-minis
[42:17] to p
[42:20] and you can see your relationship
[42:22] there
[42:23] so both of them moving in concert both
[42:26] of them moving
[42:28] in
[42:28] tandem but look closer okay this is why
[42:32] i went back to the e-mini s p why'd you
[42:33] do that ict
[42:35] do you see
[42:43] that
[42:46] look at the high here at uh
[42:48] two o'clock in the morning 2 30 in the
[42:49] morning
[42:50] today
[42:52] friday april 29th 2022.
[42:55] the rally here after
[42:58] 8 30
[43:00] it creates the high but it's lower than
[43:02] the high it took 2 30 overnight
[43:05] i'll go back
[43:06] to nasdaq
[43:12] see that
[43:14] 235
[43:16] and we have a higher run
[43:18] on nasdaq
[43:20] so this is what i teach is smt okay
[43:24] it's showing
[43:26] it's showing a willingness
[43:29] to correct the correlation
[43:32] between
[43:33] like markets
[43:35] these are closely correlated
[43:37] assets the s p 500 stocks composite
[43:41] and in nasdaq 100 stocks composite
[43:44] they generally move together in tandem
[43:47] not all the time
[43:48] so if we're bearish and we're expecting
[43:50] lower prices
[43:52] and we see this
[43:55] but the s p doesn't do it
[43:58] that's showing you that this is a stop
[44:00] run
[44:01] and it shows that s p
[44:04] is
[44:05] really weak
[44:06] so this gives you confirmation
[44:10] without using an indicator okay without
[44:12] having anything on the chart
[44:14] it shows you
[44:16] oh well let me just do it here when you
[44:18] have the nas back up like this you can
[44:19] do a comparing contrast by hitting this
[44:21] little tab here
[44:24] and we're going to add this e-mini s p
[44:28] new pane
[44:31] so it plots it below and then if you're
[44:33] comparing highs you want to go over here
[44:35] good little gear
[44:37] price source you want to change that to
[44:38] high
[44:41] and you can see
[44:42] high
[44:44] to high
[44:45] high
[44:46] to high
[44:47] higher here
[44:49] lower there so it looks like
[44:54] it looks like
[44:56] a divergence you see that
[44:58] with an indicator but it's not an
[45:00] indicator it's price
[45:01] so i use intermarket relationships and
[45:04] correlation
[45:06] and correlation used properly there's a
[45:08] lot of people that are talking about
[45:09] correlation they have no idea what
[45:10] they're talking about but if you look at
[45:12] the idea of this relationship here
[45:15] it gives you like an x-ray view of real
[45:18] accumulation and distribution
[45:20] this is distribution
[45:22] because it doesn't see the same rally
[45:24] higher that the nasdaq did okay
[45:28] there was two other things on my agenda
[45:30] here i mentioned
[45:33] to one of the young ladies i would show
[45:36] the fib
[45:38] this is nothing else so you guys are all
[45:40] welcome to turn the video off because
[45:41] this is not going to be teaching really
[45:43] anything it's for those individuals that
[45:44] just want to calibrate their
[45:47] fibonacci and also
[45:48] some of the little
[45:50] points that i add
[45:51] to the chart and i'll show you how that
[45:54] means here
[45:56] price note
[45:58] had someone asked me how do i put those
[45:59] little annotations on
[46:01] um just anchor to the high you want drag
[46:03] it over if you hold down the shift
[46:04] button it'll make it level
[46:07] you can also do that with your trend
[46:08] lines
[46:09] so if you want to add here if you start
[46:11] dragging it if you put the shift button
[46:13] it'll automatically toggle it and keep
[46:15] it straight
[46:16] and so many of my students were so
[46:18] helpful because it used to drive me
[46:19] crazy
[46:21] so anyway
[46:22] i know i told you i warned you folks
[46:24] it's not going to be
[46:26] arm burners it's simple stuff for people
[46:29] that are new all right um the last bit
[46:31] of business is the fibonacci okay so
[46:37] i'm going to anchor your fib
[46:39] to two price points
[46:41] me get this off here
[46:42] all right so
[46:43] once you have it on your chart
[46:46] highlight it and then go over to the
[46:47] little gear
[46:49] and go to style
[46:51] and style these are the settings okay
[46:54] all you do is go in click the little box
[46:55] here type in the numbers you see just
[46:57] like i have here
[46:59] now if you want to see projections on
[47:01] how far down
[47:04] or up the moose
[47:06] will likely go
[47:08] this is for equilibrium so if you want
[47:10] to see discount the premium that's what
[47:12] the 0.5 level is it's 50
[47:17] and you can see
[47:18] by having this on here it starts doing
[47:20] standard deviations
[47:22] okay
[47:23] and if you want to calibrate
[47:26] it to the daily range
[47:30] here
[47:31] it'll give you a pretty good idea of
[47:34] where
[47:36] your low should form now this was a
[47:37] little bit excited because it went below
[47:39] an important low
[47:41] but that's enough for government work
[47:47] if you want to show
[47:48] optimal trade entry levels
[47:50] and you're pulling the fill up
[47:57] i'm just taking this off so that way
[47:59] your attention is right on the levels
[48:01] that make up optimal trade trade entry
[48:03] rather
[48:04] the 62 and the 79
[48:06] okay and you can change these
[48:09] make them
[48:11] a different
[48:12] color to stand out
[48:14] i don't like to do that but you can see
[48:16] it here
[48:17] so if we were looking at it like this
[48:27] here's the optimal trade entry levels
[48:29] and it trades up into it here
[48:32] let me zoom in
[48:34] can you zoom in itt
[48:36] i young like you are
[48:40] all right so here's the high to the low
[48:43] optimal trade entry and trades up into
[48:45] it here and into the fair value got bam
[48:47] that's what makes it optimal
[48:50] so there's your entry here and you can
[48:51] start going back in
[48:58] and
[49:03] we can do
[49:05] the projections here
[49:07] again
[49:08] go into it now
[49:10] move this out of the way
[49:13] do one standard deviation
[49:15] two standard deviation
[49:18] one half standard deviation
[49:21] and i think that's enough for this one
[49:24] so the range from the high and the low
[49:28] you can get that for your
[49:33] discount the premium but for optimal
[49:35] trade entry
[49:36] i like to use the bodies
[49:39] lowest open or close
[49:42] in the swings and you can see how nice
[49:44] that gets right up almost into the 79
[49:46] percent tracing let me see that i'm
[49:48] going to take this sphere there you go
[49:49] line off you can see how yeah it cleans
[49:51] it up
[49:52] are you saying what the book say
[49:54] is you don't know how to use a fibonacci
[49:58] you have any idea how many people have
[49:59] said that over the years they actually
[50:01] made videos about me on youtube saying
[50:02] that stuff
[50:03] look at this i don't understand what
[50:04] he's doing
[50:06] it's the bulk of the volume
[50:07] i'm using the lowest opening on this
[50:09] candle here inside this swing
[50:12] and inside this swing i'm using the
[50:13] highest open or close and that's what's
[50:16] being plotted on optimal trade entries
[50:18] here i look at this as
[50:22] stop running just like this is
[50:24] i want to get to the heart of the matter
[50:26] okay i'm getting to the point
[50:28] this is extra for the people that didn't
[50:30] want to stay
[50:32] so
[50:33] the optimal trade entry level here now
[50:36] if we start looking at the projections
[50:37] down here we have one standard deviation
[50:39] down here
[50:40] project up over here
[50:42] boom
[50:43] see that
[50:44] hits it and then we have a nice
[50:46] retracement up
[50:47] so this is a good area to take profits
[50:49] here and it's also below the low so how
[50:51] far can i go below this low ict well
[50:53] there's a standard deviation right there
[50:55] and it does so handsomely then we have a
[50:57] nice little retracement then it gets
[50:59] wild right before the opening okay but
[51:02] that's the things i promised it would be
[51:04] at the end of this video that was
[51:05] supposed to be on thursday and i
[51:06] appreciate you guys being
