[00:09] all right folks welcome back this is the
[00:11] seventh episode for the ICT mentorship
[00:14] on YouTube
[00:16] 20122 this lecture is going to be
[00:18] dealing with daily bias and
[00:20] consolidation
[00:24] hurdles all right folks we're looking at
[00:26] the daily chart for the NASDAQ and
[00:30] if you're looking at trading
[00:32] view under the NASDAQ selection so it's
[00:36] the continuous contract that way it
[00:37] makes all the candles look nice and
[00:38] crisp and you don't see any spotting so
[00:41] right away if you're looking at this you
[00:42] should see this run on price taking out
[00:45] buy side liquidity see all these
[00:46] relative equal highs here ran above it
[00:49] then broke below a swing
[00:51] low created what here got trades up into
[00:56] it now where is it going to trade to
[01:00] this low to this High midpoint there's a
[01:03] gap right there and then you have the
[01:05] old
[01:06] low sell
[01:08] here aim here or here and it runs it out
[01:13] now this is important obviously it
[01:16] sounds like well you know you're cherry
[01:17] picking in imp pack old moves okay
[01:20] that's how you learn
[01:22] but think about what's happened on the
[01:24] daily chart we traded below this low
[01:28] we've taken cell liquidity out of the
[01:29] market Marketplace so with that it's
[01:32] likely to retrace back up into the range
[01:35] what's the
[01:36] range this High to that low but look
[01:40] closer see how we have this nice
[01:42] energetic run look how many down closed
[01:44] candles we have here one two three four
[01:47] lot of movement there so I'm looking at
[01:50] this high and this low and I'm trying to
[01:54] get a range for where we are at
[01:58] present so once the cell side was taken
[02:00] out here it's likely to retrace back
[02:04] inside the range of this high and this
[02:06] low we've seen it come all the way back
[02:09] up it went to a premium Market which is
[02:11] above equilibrium here and then we went
[02:14] down below to a discount bounced off of
[02:17] the old low
[02:18] here then we've Consolidated around
[02:23] equilibrium now when you have this
[02:25] condition it can make it very difficult
[02:28] to get a true reading on bias okay so
[02:32] there's times when even me as ICT I
[02:35] don't have a good clear read on what it
[02:37] is I'm looking for so I have to demand
[02:40] more price action and more information
[02:43] or Intel as I like to call it based on
[02:46] what the Market's going to do right
[02:47] after the open at 9:30 in the morning
[02:49] New York time for disclosure in my own
[02:52] paid
[02:53] membership I mentioned to them that I
[02:56] felt that this was a likely area where
[02:57] they could probably take it down there
[02:59] and sweep that area whether it goes
[03:02] lower or not it's irrelevant but where
[03:04] we were here to here that's what I was
[03:06] expecting some type of move last night
[03:11] for Tuesday's trading okay so Tuesday's
[03:15] trading the 8th of February
[03:17] 2022 going into the marketplace I was
[03:20] anticipating something that would be
[03:22] bearish that's going to be useful to us
[03:25] when we go into lower time frame charts
[03:26] because I'm going to show you what I had
[03:27] to deal with this morning and how I had
[03:29] to overcome that this is something that
[03:31] if you're using these Concepts and
[03:32] practice with your demo account you're
[03:34] going to have these same conundrums and
[03:36] you have to find a way to overcome them
[03:38] and I'm just going to suggest this to
[03:39] you
[03:40] here but before we go into the lower
[03:42] time frames I want to teach bias okay so
[03:45] if we had this setup on a daily chart
[03:47] Market structure has a shift lower we
[03:50] trade up into a fair value Gap until we
[03:52] get down to here and here each day I'm
[03:56] anticipating lower prices so my bias
[04:00] is bearish now every single day is going
[04:03] to be a down Clos candle but I'm going
[04:05] to hunt intraday price action with that
[04:10] in
[04:11] mind if I'm going to take a long it
[04:14] would be counter Trend to that bi my
[04:16] Leverage is going to be dialed back so
[04:18] let's assume for a moment that the
[04:20] account that I was trading with would
[04:21] allow me to trade 10
[04:24] contracts 10 contracts would be the
[04:27] maximum I could trade so if I'm Trading
[04:29] with the bias which would be bearish
[04:31] during the run from
[04:33] here to here and
[04:36] here then I'm going to look to utilize
[04:39] the maximum leverage that I can have
[04:41] without overleveraging by based on a
[04:44] fixed percentage basis like I like 3 and
[04:47] a half% I'm not telling you to use 3 and
[04:50] a half% you should be risking less than
[04:52] 1% about a half percent or a quarter
[04:55] percent because if you don't know what
[04:56] you're doing there's no reason to be
[04:58] putting High levels of risk behind a
[05:00] move if you don't know what it is you're
[05:02] doing it's going to create toxic
[05:04] thinking bad habits and you're going to
[05:06] be afraid to execute based on the
[05:07] results you're
[05:09] getting so you want to be indifferent to
[05:11] the results that in the beginning is
[05:13] important by having a demo account using
[05:15] very very low leverage if not
[05:17] deleveraging okay and I'll talk a little
[05:19] bit about that when we get into money
[05:21] management but that's not this
[05:23] topic so from this high down to that low
[05:26] each day I'm going in with the
[05:28] expectation that it's going to likely
[05:30] set up a sell scenario where I can get
[05:33] short and hopefully buy back at a lower
[05:37] price count how many up dayss or green
[05:40] Candles there are from this high and
[05:43] this High down to that
[05:47] low
[05:49] one
[05:50] two real
[05:53] important so the
[05:55] delivery by the algorithms are spooling
[05:59] that means prices expanding and going
[06:01] directionally one
[06:02] way when that
[06:05] occurs there's going to be times where
[06:07] you have an up closed candle that may be
[06:09] a day that you tried to go short and
[06:11] maybe you've lost okay no big deal same
[06:14] thing going into the next day going in
[06:15] for looking for shorts next day same
[06:17] thing same thing and then here it opens
[06:21] and trades down below the low and has a
[06:23] huge expansion move and then comes back
[06:25] above and that's it and closes on the
[06:27] near the high of the day or midpoint of
[06:29] the the body in this area
[06:34] here is there a lot
[06:36] of up closed candles during that bias
[06:40] being bearish
[06:42] no you need to get over the concern
[06:45] about being right every single time you
[06:48] need to put aside also the idea of
[06:50] perfection because you're not going to
[06:52] have it perfect you're not going to get
[06:54] in perfectly you're not going to get out
[06:55] perfectly you're not going to have the
[06:56] perfect amount of contracts you're not
[06:58] going to have
[07:00] you know the
[07:03] perfect asset in other words you may be
[07:05] trading the NASDAQ and the e- mini S&P
[07:07] has a little bit better run and delivers
[07:10] a little bit more highly unlikely but
[07:12] vice versa you get what I'm saying so
[07:15] you're you're always going to find
[07:16] reasons to be wrong Embrace imperfection
[07:20] embrace the idea that you don't have to
[07:23] know everything you don't have to be
[07:25] right okay being right is not equivalent
[07:28] to being profitable
[07:30] very important factor there so with bias
[07:34] in
[07:35] short you're looking at your daily chart
[07:37] to get a read on where it's likely to go
[07:39] to next where's the price going to draw
[07:41] is it going to draw higher to an old
[07:43] high is it going to draw down to an old
[07:45] low and until it gets that higher low
[07:50] you stay with that bias okay so it's a
[07:54] quick down and dirty way of interpreting
[07:56] price action for daily bias but the
[07:59] focus that I've taught that are hung up
[08:02] on daily bias really what they're trying
[08:05] to say is and this is exactly what
[08:07] they're getting at but they can't either
[08:08] articulate or they just won't be honest
[08:10] with it or
[08:12] me what they want is tell me how to get
[08:15] the high of the day when it's bearish
[08:17] and how to get out at the low and get
[08:20] all the move and never take a
[08:22] loss and avoid when it's going to be a
[08:25] day that goes against me where I feel
[08:30] comfortable now that might sound
[08:33] extreme and maybe some of you that have
[08:35] issues with daily bias are thinking to
[08:38] yourself that's not me I just want to
[08:39] know when it's going to go up when it's
[08:40] going to go down I'm telling you if you
[08:42] strip it down that's what you're trying
[08:45] to do you're trying to demand that I
[08:47] give you some magic bullet that's going
[08:49] to give you the absolute highest high
[08:51] and the lowest low on the bearish and
[08:53] bullish days so that way you're trading
[08:56] perfectly I don't trade perfectly no one
[08:59] trades perfectly so you have to have
[09:02] this embracing of the gray area in the
[09:05] marketplace that gray area is where
[09:09] things aren't always so clear but
[09:12] because of experience you've had in the
[09:13] past seeing things unfold the way they
[09:16] hopefully would if you've been trained
[09:18] properly then there's nothing to fear
[09:20] even if you do it wrong and you have a
[09:22] adverse reaction or result to taking a
[09:25] trade using the logic that you're
[09:27] training with there's no reason to be
[09:30] fearful because one or two or maybe a
[09:33] small string of losing trades does not
[09:35] in any way shape or form diminish the
[09:37] effectiveness of a model if it's based
[09:39] on Sound
[09:40] Logic
[09:43] so you're going to utilize the daily
[09:45] chart to determine whether or not the
[09:48] next candle is going to be likely
[09:50] bullish or bearish between this High
[09:53] here in the midpoint of this low to
[09:57] high I'm expecting down closed candles
[10:00] that would equate to a bearish bias it
[10:03] doesn't mean that I can't take a long
[10:05] entry it just means that if I do take a
[10:06] long entry in day I'm going to do it
[10:08] with far less
[10:09] leverage and if I see a setup that's
[10:12] bearish I'll use or consider using not
[10:15] always but I'll consider using my
[10:17] maximum risk which is 4 and a
[10:18] half% but I like to see trades that I
[10:21] feel comfortable with with 3 and a
[10:24] half% and until we get down to this low
[10:26] and underneath it that means it's likely
[10:28] to reverse RSE or
[10:30] consolidate and we have a retracement
[10:32] back in So once it starts doing this and
[10:35] it's hanging around equilibrium it gets
[10:37] very difficult even for me to determine
[10:41] a bias so what does that mean no trading
[10:45] no it just means that you have to rely
[10:47] on these smaller time frame intraday
[10:49] charts and just simply look for
[10:50] liquidity pools so you're going to trade
[10:52] intraday
[10:53] volatility running old highs running out
[10:55] old lows being a lot more nimble
[11:03] and like a surgical strike you you take
[11:06] your handles or your points that you're
[11:08] trying to get out of the marketplace and
[11:10] then run you don't try to overstay your
[11:12] welcome so let's go down to a lower time
[11:16] frame all right so we have the 15 minute
[11:20] time frame and we have our 8:30 in the
[11:22] morning crosshairs
[11:24] here crosshairs are the vertical line
[11:27] that denotes the time that we start
[11:30] looking back to the left
[11:32] okay right here go to the left we see
[11:35] here this is our first low so we Mark
[11:38] that and right in
[11:40] here to first to the left is here we
[11:43] don't want to use this low by itself
[11:46] because it's inside of this candle so I
[11:50] want to use the extreme where's the
[11:52] liquidity going to be is it going to be
[11:53] above this or is it going to be above
[11:54] that it's going to be above this okay
[11:57] why why not that one
[11:59] and why this one keep looking left what
[12:02] do you see over here see that these are
[12:05] relative equal highs what does retail
[12:08] Traders see that as resistance so they
[12:12] see it going up to here stopping and
[12:14] going lower they see it going up to here
[12:15] failing to go up here so now they think
[12:16] this is a really strong resistance level
[12:20] and it went lower look at that then the
[12:22] market showed
[12:23] how that level is real resistance by
[12:26] going right through it but this would be
[12:28] a first Target here to reach
[12:31] for and if you want to use a longer term
[12:35] intraday Target would be back here
[12:38] because to the left of this one is this
[12:40] one which essentially is the
[12:42] same then we have this one here okay
[12:45] so obviously with the benefit of
[12:47] hindsight you can see that we traded
[12:49] below that low here then we reversed and
[12:54] started going higher we took out this
[12:56] High here which I traded this
[12:59] I did not hold for this now the question
[13:02] is going to be is why didn't you hold it
[13:03] for that one ICT well if you look at the
[13:08] range from this high down to the low
[13:11] over
[13:13] here about midpoint is just above this
[13:16] high right and we have this little
[13:19] imbalance right there so whatever I'm
[13:22] teaching you in this
[13:23] mentorship I'm looking for about the
[13:26] midpoint and some kind of liquidity
[13:30] there's buy stops above that okay so we
[13:33] traded
[13:34] below I went along on that candle I'll
[13:37] show you in a live account trust me just
[13:39] hear me
[13:41] out I
[13:43] bought a rout up here and I took
[13:46] out on this candle here I got out on
[13:49] that
[13:50] high now I could have held
[13:53] it but to do so would be painting the
[13:57] picture that you can do this
[13:59] and take down these types of Trades all
[14:02] the time and the reality is you're going
[14:03] to require a lot more time to develop
[14:07] than you probably think it will
[14:09] require one of the things that happens
[14:11] when I have students come under my
[14:12] tutelage is they have been fooled by
[14:15] listening to people talk about the left
[14:18] side of the chart all the time and they
[14:19] can't execute on the right side and it
[14:23] is useful in the beginning but if that's
[14:25] all there ever is and if your educator
[14:28] can't trade on the hard right edge of
[14:30] the
[14:31] chart it kind of makes you
[14:36] feel well either a false sense of
[14:38] security or a false sense of confidence
[14:41] that quickly gets evaporated when you
[14:43] trade with a live account or creates
[14:47] analysis paralysis and I have a large
[14:50] body of students that are lumped into
[14:53] one of those
[14:55] categories they've been utilizing some
[14:57] other concept or approach or they call
[15:01] it SMC smart money
[15:04] Concepts and they'll think to themselves
[15:06] that you know this is what's going to
[15:07] have to happen in the chart and it isn't
[15:11] because they're lacking narrative so one
[15:13] of the things that I'm
[15:15] teaching in this mentorship in my paid
[15:17] mentorship is how to view the
[15:19] marketplace from a narrative standpoint
[15:21] what's the logic why should the market
[15:23] do what it's doing it's not enough to
[15:25] see how a low is taken out and the
[15:26] expected to go higher or a high taken
[15:28] out and the expected to go low
[15:29] there has to be some greater context
[15:31] behind it and that's what I gave you in
[15:33] the beginning of the
[15:37] video now on the two-minute chart why
[15:41] the two-minute chart well that's for
[15:42] your homework you go through the five
[15:44] minute the 4 minute the 3 minute the 2
[15:46] minute and the one minute chart I'm
[15:48] going to utilize the two-minute chart
[15:50] because this is what I was using today
[15:51] for my own analysis okay all right so
[15:53] you can see how we had the old low here
[15:55] we trade down below
[15:57] it and
[15:59] this 10:04 I'm actually highlighting
[16:02] that candle right there the reason why
[16:04] I'm using that candle's low and taking
[16:06] the screen capture there so I want you
[16:08] to see the low candles
[16:10] price okay so that's where your stop
[16:12] would have to be just below that maybe
[16:14] one one tick by going long in here based
[16:17] on the logic I'm going to start to
[16:18] outline
[16:19] here the market trades below the old low
[16:23] trades below it rallies above but does
[16:26] it trade Above This short-term High yet
[16:28] no
[16:30] then it goes down once more below the
[16:34] old low but not below this low here then
[16:36] it turns and goes
[16:39] higher what did I see in this
[16:42] chart that allowed me to go long in
[16:47] here what did I
[16:51] see
[16:52] nothing I didn't see anything in this
[16:55] particular chart I saw it in the S&P
[16:58] before I leave this chart I want you to
[17:00] think about how that high was around
[17:29] this High here that's where it could
[17:31] reach for 830 we're right here what's
[17:35] the point of expecting to go above that
[17:37] not much we want to see some kind of a
[17:40] protraction so the market yes it went
[17:42] above that short-term high and then went
[17:43] lower than that low yes but Watch What
[17:46] Happens it trades below it comes back up
[17:48] and look at all the volatility and the
[17:50] sloppiness inside this area here then
[17:52] the market starts to Rally so the draw
[17:55] in liquidity is going to be
[17:57] here it took out cell side here so let's
[18:00] look inside this price action and see if
[18:01] there's any details that would lead to a
[18:04] run into that we'll call it the 44.95
[18:08] level
[18:10] okay so the two-minute chart this is
[18:13] what I was
[18:14] using the market trades below the old
[18:16] low as we see here I apologize to
[18:19] screenshot I wish I would have had these
[18:21] things on it but you can look at your
[18:23] two-minute chart on trading View and
[18:24] you'll see this a little bit more clear
[18:25] I apologize but this low C
[18:29] it's high then we have one candle up the
[18:33] next candle is low there's your fair
[18:34] value Gap that's the run in here so we
[18:39] have displacement low and displacement
[18:42] high is there a market structure shift
[18:44] bullish yes it trades up above it and
[18:47] you look for the fair value G is there
[18:48] one in here no anything in here no how
[18:51] about here no it's closed in with this
[18:53] Mo move down here but we have this so we
[18:57] trade down into it here and 1036 that
[19:00] candle forms that's a long in S&P
[19:04] now compare that with this fair value
[19:08] Gap in the S&P we traded below the old
[19:12] low we took sell side out we have a
[19:14] shift in Market structure on the S&P
[19:16] these averages tend to move in
[19:19] tandem so that means they generally move
[19:21] in the same direction so I'm looking at
[19:23] the Dow even though you don't see me
[19:25] trading it I'm looking at it I'm also
[19:27] looking at the S&P even though I'm
[19:30] favoring the NASDAQ because its
[19:32] volatility and its movement is more than
[19:34] the S&P other Traders might be fearful
[19:36] of the volatility say I don't want to
[19:38] trade that it's too fast for me I am
[19:40] loving this because I know how to trade
[19:42] I can work within that volatility
[19:44] because I know what I'm looking for I
[19:45] know the signatures the algorithm is
[19:46] going to put out so until I get these
[19:50] signatures I have to wait or put leaders
[19:52] into the marketplace which is what I'm
[19:54] going to show you when I show you my
[19:55] Live account results today but at 10:36
[19:57] let's go back up
[20:00] to the
[20:01] NASDAQ we don't see any fair value Gap
[20:03] in there do we nope but we start to see
[20:06] NASDAQ
[20:07] turning so I went in Long in close
[20:11] proximity to this order
[20:14] block okay I went in at
[20:19] 14,505 that's inside of this order block
[20:23] so I'm trading close to it now I
[20:25] promised I wasn't going to teach order
[20:26] blocks that much in this mentorship and
[20:28] some of you have been leaving comments
[20:29] oh I'm not into this now because you're
[20:31] not teaching order blocks okay go watch
[20:33] something else I'm going to teach it the
[20:35] way I want to teach it okay it works and
[20:38] you have to get yourself acclimated to
[20:40] how I'm teaching it or don't watch okay
[20:42] I don't mean to be rude but I'm not
[20:44] taking suggestions on how to teach you
[20:46] so if we are expecting a fair value Gap
[20:49] to be a launching point for the S&P and
[20:53] these markets generally move in tandem I
[20:55] don't need the fair value Gap in the
[20:59] NASDAQ because I'm utilizing the S&P as
[21:01] my
[21:03] indicator what did I just
[21:05] say the word that should not be
[21:08] spoken indicators yeah even though I
[21:11] don't have them plastered all over my
[21:13] charts like graffiti you can see the
[21:15] candlesticks in my charts you can see
[21:17] the logic you can see how the markets
[21:19] run for liquidity there's nothing hiding
[21:20] or masquerading price you can see it
[21:22] it's clear you need that you need to be
[21:25] able to read the story of price and not
[21:27] the story of indicators so the logic is
[21:31] that S&P low in here was trading down
[21:34] into an old fair value Gap over here in
[21:37] its price swing but there is no fair
[21:39] value Gap in the NASDAQ see that now
[21:41] let's go back down into the
[21:46] S&P even my own paid memberships
[21:48] learning something
[21:49] tonight I should have charged money for
[21:52] this one oh
[21:54] ICT fair value Gap trade down into it
[21:57] there that's a long for S&P
[21:59] but I don't want to trade the
[22:00] S&P so I'm going to use the timing of
[22:03] that candle for my long entry on
[22:07] ndaq trading what's not in the chart
[22:11] hint hint nudge nudge so Market rallies
[22:16] and it trades into that short-term high
[22:19] that was seen on let's go back up right
[22:21] here so again just roughing it around
[22:24] that 4496 449
[22:29] we'll just call it 96
[22:31] 4496 and that would be right in here
[22:34] bang hits it sweeps it accumulat some
[22:36] more and then rallies even higher taking
[22:38] out that longer term old
[22:40] high all
[22:42] right what gave me the confidence that
[22:45] this was turning
[22:48] here well let's take a look at the three
[22:50] averages together if you look at how the
[22:53] Market's trading low here on the Dow
[22:55] this top chart is the Dow futures the
[22:58] NASDAQ futures is in the middle and the
[23:00] S&P is at the lower end here so it's Dow
[23:03] NASDAQ
[23:06] S&P during that decline in the NASDAQ
[23:09] and the S&P look what the Dow's
[23:13] doing it's saying nah I'm going to sit
[23:16] this one out
[23:18] boys it's not willing to make that lower
[23:20] low where NASDAQ did S&P did when you
[23:26] see that right there and here's an
[23:28] important thing you anticipated already
[23:32] you're not looking for this this is what
[23:34] some of my students when they come into
[23:35] my mentorship they see this pattern they
[23:37] think oh it's diverging so it means it's
[23:38] going to go the other direction no this
[23:41] is something that confirms an idea that
[23:43] you had already established before price
[23:46] does what it's doing real time what does
[23:49] that mean you're already looking for a
[23:51] reason to go higher so that means you're
[23:53] looking at an old low does it trade
[23:54] below the old low okay does it have a
[23:57] shift in Market structure that's bullish
[23:58] yes we saw that in the S&P but we did
[24:00] not see it in NASDAQ no evidence
[24:02] whatsoever was in NASDAQ this morning
[24:04] with what I'm teaching you but it
[24:07] was listen it
[24:10] was in the
[24:13] S&P and no I don't trade the Dow but I
[24:17] utilize it like a indicator it's not
[24:19] plastered all over my chart I'm
[24:21] referring to it because I have multiple
[24:22] monitors I'm looking at my screens I
[24:24] have a screen that shows charts like
[24:26] this so I'm
[24:28] looking at the relationship of all three
[24:31] averages stacked over top of one another
[24:34] and if I'm looking at a period of time
[24:36] and an area in price action that maybe
[24:40] is going under accumulation for long
[24:42] positions this is what I'm looking for
[24:45] I'm looking for that little fingerprint
[24:46] of the algorithm what this is indicating
[24:48] is that Dow is unwilling to go lower
[24:50] than that low that tips off individuals
[24:54] that are looking for cracks and
[24:56] correlation okay Cor would be they are
[24:59] moving
[25:01] lower here here and here but they that
[25:06] correlation where they move in tandem
[25:09] together cracks here at a very important
[25:15] time right when the NASDAQ and the S&P
[25:18] are trading below its old low I get
[25:20] questioned all the time ICT how do you
[25:22] know it's going to be a fake Break below
[25:26] and old low and rally higher or or a
[25:28] fake Break above an old high and go
[25:31] lower which is what I dub a turtle soup
[25:34] now that's not the same pattern that is
[25:36] taught in Linda rash and Larry Connor's
[25:39] book Street smarts which is actually an
[25:40] excellent book I have my own
[25:43] interpretation of that which is very
[25:44] easy it's simple there isn't like you
[25:46] know I'm not going to teach their
[25:47] pattern and go buy their book and you
[25:49] support the authors but the idea is I'm
[25:52] looking for runs above old highs to set
[25:55] up a short position if I have the
[25:57] opposite of this condition here where
[25:59] maybe the Dow didn't make a higher High
[26:01] where the S&P and NASDAQ did make a
[26:03] higher high by itself it doesn't mean
[26:06] anything so many students over the years
[26:08] have simply went in there and said oh
[26:09] this is Magic I'm going to go just do
[26:11] that and I unwillingly did the same
[26:14] thing when I first started observing it
[26:16] I'm like I don't need to do anything
[26:17] else I just look for this and it didn't
[26:20] work out well okay I blew accounts yes
[26:23] I'm not ashamed to say it in the '90s I
[26:25] blew accounts doing this very thing here
[26:27] just looking for these diers
[26:29] and then I later learned that I have to
[26:31] have some kind of narrative as to why
[26:34] this would even
[26:35] form and to be honest with you I don't
[26:38] personally need to see this because I
[26:41] know what I'm looking for I already know
[26:43] that it's going to create this
[26:45] Divergence at the times I'm trying to
[26:47] buy but as a developing student you may
[26:49] not have that experience and there's
[26:51] nothing wrong with that and you may have
[26:53] you may been trading longer than me
[26:54] maybe you've been trading 31 years you
[26:56] know uh there's nothing wrong with that
[26:57] maybe
[26:58] you don't need this either but for a
[27:00] developing student someone that doesn't
[27:02] have a affinity for reading price action
[27:04] naked and not using indicators these are
[27:07] the best indicators you're ever going to
[27:09] have you don't need moving averages you
[27:11] don't need stochastic you don't need
[27:13] Fibonacci you don't need in that stuff
[27:15] okay you don't need it the only reason
[27:17] why I'm pulling a fib up is to show you
[27:18] where the midpoint is have you noticed
[27:21] that we haven't even talked about
[27:22] optimal trade entry none of that stuff
[27:24] I've stripped this down to the Chrome
[27:27] and it's beautiful is it not it's easy
[27:30] it's so simple it better be easy enough
[27:33] for my daughter to do it because if you
[27:35] can't do this one I don't have anything
[27:36] for but
[27:37] nonetheless I want you to think about
[27:40] how this pattern
[27:43] confirms the accumulation of long
[27:46] positions now let me correct those of
[27:49] you that are going to take this
[27:50] information and run out there and create
[27:51] your own videos or your own little
[27:53] courses or your own little mentorships
[27:54] okay because if you don't do this right
[27:56] you're going to hurt the people that are
[27:57] listen listening to you and I just don't
[27:59] want them to get hurt because of your
[28:01] lack of understanding what's going
[28:03] on the Dow is not going down because
[28:08] buyers are coming in that's not what's
[28:10] happening here that's what authors and
[28:13] book writers and people that don't
[28:14] really trade or code algorithms will
[28:18] have you
[28:20] believe this is an unwillingness to
[28:23] deliver to that
[28:24] low this is a macro a macro is something
[28:28] inside of an algorithm that prevents or
[28:31] enables
[28:33] delivery delivery of what
[28:36] price so the Dow is unwilling to go
[28:38] lower here okay by itself means nothing
[28:40] does it happen at the same time that the
[28:42] NASDAQ went lower yes at the same time
[28:44] the S&P went lower than that low yes
[28:47] okay so let's go back here's that old
[28:51] low prior to 8:30 remember algorithms
[28:56] run on time
[28:58] and price not price and
[29:01] time multi-level marketers the
[29:05] low that's the price yeah but you have
[29:08] to refer to time first what's the
[29:11] important factor of time 8:30 good to
[29:14] the left what's the first low right
[29:15] there boom so there's liquidity below
[29:18] that it trades below it here then wait
[29:22] do we get a signal that allows us to
[29:26] hunt what I'm teaching you on this
[29:27] mentorship
[29:29] there's a swing High it breaks it
[29:33] there so now Market structure shifted
[29:36] bullish look back through this price leg
[29:39] there's your fair value Gap oh but what
[29:41] happens if it goes down there and it
[29:43] keeps on going that's what your stop is
[29:45] for remember what I said earlier in the
[29:47] video some of you are
[29:51] so new okay your infancy as a Speculator
[29:56] and Trader is
[29:59] it's getting in the way of Sound Logic
[30:01] because what you're thinking is there's
[30:03] a way for you to trade and never take a
[30:05] loss there's a way for you to somehow
[30:09] and this is nowhere near true that you
[30:12] could enter the market and your stop
[30:14] never needs to be placed because you're
[30:18] right because what you're saying is I'm
[30:20] afraid to be
[30:21] wrong that's a psychological barrier
[30:23] that you need to get over because I'm
[30:25] going to show you my Live account and
[30:27] there's going to be some negative
[30:28] numbers there those negative numbers
[30:31] sometimes are
[30:33] premium payments for me to get more
[30:36] Intel okay and with that let's go into
[30:39] the continuation of
[30:42] this all right so here is my Live
[30:45] account and I did some trades this
[30:47] morning I got to my desk a little late
[30:50] this
[30:51] morning couldn't focus I had some
[30:54] expectations I wanted to see it Go lower
[30:56] I told my paid man ship last night that
[30:59] I prefer a move lower uh we got a really
[31:03] sloppy opening which is really
[31:06] characteristic of the 930 opening a lot
[31:08] of people tell you don't trade the 9:30
[31:10] opening it's scary it's too much
[31:12] volatility I actually don't mind it
[31:15] because I'm actually putting sometimes a
[31:18] order in to get a feel for what it's
[31:20] doing now right away if I just show you
[31:23] this chart and don't give you the
[31:24] context behind it you're going to hear
[31:26] people or they're going to take my video
[31:27] and they're going to do all this
[31:28] armchair quarterback after the fact it's
[31:30] never been traded by them they're not
[31:32] doing a live account they're always
[31:33] playing in demo accounts blowing demo
[31:35] accounts they always have something
[31:36] negative to say about everybody else but
[31:37] they're not doing anything on themselves
[31:40] here's the context that's important okay
[31:42] back in the 90s I learned a lot of
[31:44] things from a Floor Trader that actually
[31:47] traded the S&P on the floor I also
[31:49] picked up more insights from Larry
[31:52] Williams about trading the S&P and also
[31:55] George and gel now George Andel had a
[31:58] really interesting concept when I first
[31:59] heard about it I kind of immediately
[32:02] discounted it I was like that's stupid
[32:04] and what is it well on the
[32:07] floor sometimes Traders would
[32:10] have just a disconnect they wouldn't
[32:13] have a read on what the price is
[32:16] doing so what they would do not just
[32:18] George but everybody on the floor would
[32:19] generally try to do this as well they
[32:21] would simply go in and buy or sell short
[32:24] one
[32:26] contract and just see what happens now
[32:29] for someone that doesn't know what
[32:31] trading is like never traded with life
[32:33] money or just now learning that's going
[32:36] to be like that's stupid if you don't
[32:38] know what you're doing why would you put
[32:39] an order in
[32:42] well if you want to know how the
[32:44] Market's likely to
[32:46] deliver put some skin in the race you'll
[32:49] have a greater feel for what it's doing
[32:53] when you put an order in it doesn't need
[32:54] to be a large order I'm only putting one
[32:56] contract in I can only trade one
[32:57] contract because of the equity I have in
[32:59] the account it's like 21 plus th000 to
[33:02] do one NASDAQ contract and it's
[33:04] Justified because of the volatility you
[33:06] could be up or down $5,000 in a session
[33:09] so you know discount brokers are not a
[33:11] Saving
[33:12] Grace so I put a order in two times I
[33:16] got to my desk late I wanted to dial in
[33:19] and the shest way for me to do that is
[33:20] just to toss a contract in now when I do
[33:24] that I'm trying to read what the price
[33:26] is doing against that order I'm not
[33:28] trying to pick a spot when I'm tossing
[33:30] that in there either now I understand
[33:33] how someone that would never have had
[33:35] any experience trading with real money
[33:37] would look at that and say that's dumb
[33:39] like that's somebody doesn't know what
[33:40] they're doing no you have no idea the
[33:42] benefits of having that it's like
[33:44] dropping a hook in water that you've
[33:47] never fished in you test it see I'm
[33:50] getting any bites
[33:52] here if I throw a short order in or if I
[33:54] throw a long order in I'm watching I'm
[33:57] getting a feel for what the Market's
[33:59] doing once that order's in there and I'm
[34:02] reading the reactions I'm not looking at
[34:04] the equity okay I'm not I'm not trying
[34:06] to get a tug-of-war sensation internally
[34:08] of making money losing money I'm
[34:10] watching how price delivers around that
[34:14] order is it easily moving away from that
[34:16] order or is it lethargically moving away
[34:19] or is it completely running against it
[34:22] that IM that immediate feedback that
[34:25] that feedback loop that it gives you as
[34:27] a a Trader because you have something in
[34:29] there that's worth
[34:31] something you're going to be more
[34:34] attentive to what price is doing and
[34:36] what you're familiar with with reading
[34:37] price than if you were just watching the
[34:39] charts paint the candles and it's
[34:42] something that is true when it comes to
[34:44] like learning with a demo account this
[34:45] is the limitations of learning with a
[34:48] demo because you can test the waters
[34:51] okay by throwing in a single
[34:55] contract and if that contract is is
[34:59] basically you know ran
[35:02] over for a lack of a better term then
[35:05] you know that your bias probably isn't
[35:07] in alignment with that order so if I'm
[35:10] trying to hunt the bigger move of the
[35:12] day I will sacrifice these initial
[35:15] little runs I'm not doing it all the
[35:16] time remember where we started this
[35:18] video we're in the middle of that range
[35:20] on the daily chart so technically it can
[35:23] go either side of the the range and take
[35:25] liquidity I don't know when going to
[35:28] sleep at night time and also when I'm
[35:30] doing videos earlier in the evening I
[35:31] don't know where price is going to be at
[35:33] at 9:30 in the morning New York time the
[35:35] next day I don't know that no one knows
[35:37] that okay no one's going to know that so
[35:39] when I build a trading plan or idea
[35:41] around what I would prefer to see I'm
[35:43] only looking for that the night before
[35:47] everything changes when we walk up to
[35:49] that 8:30 you
[35:51] know vertical line it gets put on my
[35:53] chart to show you
[35:55] now based on those ideas and the
[35:59] relationship of the information I'm
[36:02] getting with that initial contract going
[36:04] in at the opening at 930 I'm getting a
[36:07] read on price sometimes these trades pan
[36:09] out and it's profitable that's not the
[36:11] point and sometimes it creates a small
[36:14] draw down on the
[36:16] account that small draw down if you
[36:19] count that as a skill thing you're
[36:21] missing the point entirely okay if you
[36:25] can get yourself and Avail yourself some
[36:28] you know writings by George Angel
[36:29] invariably you're going to hear him or
[36:31] read him suggesting he's done this and
[36:34] Floor Traders did it as well when I
[36:36] started implementing it and I've done
[36:38] this with Forex too sometimes my
[36:40] students will tell you if we were all in
[36:41] a big Stadium okay and we were all like
[36:43] saying raise your hand if I said this or
[36:45] if I did not say that they would all
[36:47] raise their hand when I say sometimes
[36:50] I'll do this with Forex I just want to
[36:51] know what it's doing I need more
[36:53] information and there's no better
[36:55] feedback loop than to put something at
[36:57] risk in the marketplace CU you don't
[36:59] have anything at risk with a demo you
[37:01] can put a trade on with a demo but
[37:03] you're not really feeling anything from
[37:05] that you're only really drawing a
[37:10] connection when it's right when it's
[37:12] wrong it's just like well whatever I'm
[37:14] not I would have never taken that trade
[37:16] anyway so it's important you know the
[37:19] context here okay with that aside let's
[37:23] move forward so these are me putting in
[37:25] a leader in the market just to see if I
[37:27] can
[37:28] get a better read even though I want to
[37:29] see it going lower I'm not so sure with
[37:32] all this back and forth movement I don't
[37:34] know if it wants to run higher for reach
[37:36] for higher form of buy side liquidity or
[37:38] if it's going to run lower for that low
[37:41] so I tossed in two orders and you can
[37:43] see them when I show you the the history
[37:45] on my next
[37:47] slide but all this went away and then
[37:50] here's where I went short here and I
[37:52] covered basically then I went long right
[37:54] on that candle right there and what was
[37:56] my price
[37:58] ,55 A5 okay and I closed above that high
[38:02] remember the high was at
[38:05] 14620 here it is
[38:07] 14,622 and 3/4 so that's 117
[38:12] handles I don't care about these little
[38:15] Mickey Mouse moves back here because
[38:16] that is a premium for Intel I'm going to
[38:19] make a small investment to get a better
[38:21] read on these types of moves here okay
[38:24] if I show you these types of charts or I
[38:27] make them available on the internet with
[38:29] no context behind them whatsoever
[38:33] none they would be trolled all day long
[38:35] and they would beat their chest and feel
[38:37] smart like they're saying something that
[38:38] means something they have no idea they
[38:39] have no reason to think that they
[38:42] anything they're saying is valid or true
[38:45] but I'm showing you the logic here okay
[38:48] this is not latency okay when I was
[38:52] doing latency tests that is me testing
[38:54] the feedback timing from putting a trade
[38:57] in how fast I can put orders in what
[38:59] type of slippage I'm getting cuz I have
[39:01] an algorithm and that timing is
[39:04] important for me because this account
[39:06] won't stay at one contract it'll
[39:09] eventually grow till I can do more so I
[39:11] need to know how fast I can ramp it up
[39:14] or is it going to take me a little bit
[39:15] longer term time frame to build it up
[39:18] before I can start pressing it harder
[39:21] everything I'm showing you in this
[39:22] account is All One Mini contract basis
[39:26] not more than one just one because of
[39:28] the leverage and the limitations of
[39:30] margin it won't it it prevents me from
[39:33] doing so okay as you can see it's $ 37,8
[39:39] 2315 and those trades that I showed you
[39:42] on the chart here is
[39:45] that history or whatever the somebody
[39:49] was posting uh show us the history you
[39:52] know it's not a live account unless you
[39:54] can show this area here well here's the
[39:56] trades I've taken for
[39:57] today here was the initial trade
[40:02] here okay you might look at this and say
[40:04] oh man I wouldn't do that pay
[40:08] $750 I'm looking for significant price
[40:10] moves I'm looking at trades that are a
[40:12] little bit more significant intraday
[40:14] because that's the model I'm teaching
[40:15] you now I can teach you a very high
[40:18] frequency type trading style that
[40:20] literally will blow the doors and beat
[40:21] the brakes off of all these supposed
[40:23] algorithms that YouTube's
[40:25] promoting and they won't have have these
[40:27] types of trades in them okay it'll be
[40:29] just real clean like 500 pip $500 runs
[40:33] or $300 runs on equity and then you get
[40:35] in and get out one contract so as you
[40:38] build this up you know 10 contracts it
[40:40] would be easy for you to do3 to $5,000 a
[40:42] day if you take the results I'm showing
[40:44] you here these are the trade results
[40:47] these are my two leaders I put in okay
[40:49] and I got a better feel for what the
[40:50] price was going to do I took the trade
[40:52] here this one here once we got closer to
[40:56] the actual setup around on 10:30
[40:58] 1036
[41:00] candle these again I was testing whether
[41:03] or not that there's going to be a run
[41:04] now I'm
[41:06] sacrificing this and a little bit more
[41:08] of my starting Equity to get that
[41:11] information because I
[41:13] know if I get the right Intel I know if
[41:16] I'm
[41:17] buying okay I'm going to be buying then
[41:20] I'm going to look at the S&P like I
[41:21] showed you
[41:22] tonight the pattern the setup remember
[41:25] what I was telling you at the beginning
[41:26] of this mentorship
[41:28] this pattern forms every single day but
[41:30] you have to look for it it may not be in
[41:34] your asset it may not be in your
[41:37] particular Market but it exists all of
[41:40] these markets move like boats in a in
[41:44] high tide and low tide all boats rise in
[41:46] high tide all boats drop and lower with
[41:50] low tide so I'm trying to get a read on
[41:54] this environment as a whole not just my
[41:58] own asset class and since I'm trading
[42:00] the NASDAQ I'm not limiting my view or
[42:02] analysis to just NASDAQ there has to be
[42:04] some intermarket
[42:06] relationships okay and I'm combining
[42:08] markets that I'm not even trading like
[42:10] the Dow and the S&P but I'm using the
[42:13] feedback that they're providing me in
[42:16] terms of intermarket relationships so
[42:19] that's what I taught you tonight
[42:20] intermarket
[42:21] relationships and using the
[42:23] consolidation hurdles like when you have
[42:25] a consolidation what do you what you do
[42:27] well this is what I do you know I'll
[42:30] throw a contract in there to see what
[42:31] it's doing and I'll get a feel for that
[42:33] I don't care about draw down because I'm
[42:37] comfortable I can go in and fix the draw
[42:39] down at the end of the year you're going
[42:41] to see that every single day in here
[42:44] there's draw down and I correct
[42:48] it my goal is no losing
[42:51] days now that's not something that you
[42:54] should
[42:55] have as a goal coming out of the gates
[42:58] as a new student I'm not saying that
[43:00] you're ever going to get to that point
[43:01] and I do have losing days but I'm not
[43:04] showing losing days predominantly if I
[43:07] have a losing day here or there it's
[43:08] probably been two since the start of
[43:11] this
[43:12] account I fix the draw down I know how
[43:14] to do that so when I was doing latency
[43:17] tests and I'm testing tdmr trade speed
[43:20] and how they can deal with my positions
[43:22] when I'm getting in getting out getting
[43:23] in getting out I'm getting a read on how
[43:26] fast they can fill me
[43:27] what type of slippage I'm having because
[43:29] when you start doing lots of contracts
[43:32] that's going to mean a whole lot more
[43:33] than just one contract but one contract
[43:36] as you can see
[43:38] here I want to say this real quick and
[43:40] get out of the way um the profits and
[43:42] loss category right there that little
[43:44] tab it's at $
[43:47] 13,926 that is not a lot of money folks
[43:49] it's not but it's 51 plus per now in two
[43:53] weeks of trading two weeks well two
[43:56] weeks in today days now a day say two
[43:58] weeks and one day so two weeks one day
[44:02] 51% now it's one contract if I was
[44:06] trading with 10
[44:10] contracts we would be in some serious
[44:12] money then right you start paying more
[44:14] attention to it then right 13,000 almost
[44:16] $14,000 isn't that much money but what
[44:19] happens if you start doing that every
[44:20] single month I'm not suggesting that you
[44:22] can or will or promising that you will
[44:24] but what happens if you
[44:26] do would you make a living on
[44:28] that I'm just asking I put a poll on my
[44:33] community Tab and I asked everyone that
[44:34] would read it is 20% a month return is
[44:39] at a respectable rate of return and if
[44:42] you look at the results it's
[44:43] predominantly yes the other answer was
[44:47] no it's not enough for me now I know
[44:48] there's a lot of trolls that you know
[44:50] like to watch me they'll put whatever
[44:52] the expected adverse choice would be
[44:55] they'll choose that one okay okay but
[44:58] I'm sure there's some of you that think
[44:59] because your first you know impression
[45:02] about trading is everybody gets rich and
[45:04] nobody loses money and everybody gets
[45:06] Lamborghinis in the first three months
[45:08] and it's just great you know nothing
[45:10] nothing bad can happen it's all up from
[45:12] here and I've never been a mentor like
[45:14] that okay I've had very nice flashy
[45:17] things but I don't try to promote that
[45:18] idea I teach you this is going to take a
[45:20] lot of work but the work and the things
[45:23] that are real about this industry and
[45:25] how you're going to have to get like I'm
[45:27] teaching you T night what causes me to
[45:29] get clarity cuz sometimes I don't have
[45:32] it I don't know is something I say
[45:35] periodically and not knowing something
[45:37] is not ignorance it's not an absence of
[45:41] skill it's honesty and you have to be
[45:44] honest with yourself and you cannot
[45:45] assume that you're going to be coming
[45:46] into these markets being perfect because
[45:48] perfect is not something that exists in
[45:50] trading it does not exist there is never
[45:53] going to be someone that's
[45:55] perfect you're in this industry to do
[45:57] what make
[46:00] money that's it if you're in here for
[46:03] any other reason I'm in here to impress
[46:04] my dad impress my mom my girlfriend
[46:06] boyfriend husband
[46:08] whatever old gym
[46:11] teachers that's the wrong reason because
[46:14] you're doing things from an
[46:16] emotional high and when you have the
[46:19] emotional low it really hurts and you
[46:21] need to keep yourself focused on why
[46:25] you're doing this your you're doing it
[46:27] to make money to improve your financial
[46:30] condition like I mentioned before I
[46:32] start this mentorship I believe that
[46:33] there are hard times coming ahead and
[46:38] you don't need to make $144,000 in two
[46:41] weeks you don't need
[46:43] that but if you make your car note for
[46:47] the month or if you make 50% of your
[46:49] mortgage or rent payment every month
[46:51] with something like this and I'm not
[46:53] saying or promising you can but think
[46:55] like that let it evolve from that when I
[46:58] was a young
[46:59] man and I said this many times in my uh
[47:02] videos and I have some people in this uh
[47:04] mentorship that are watching that they
[47:06] don't like when I do these types of
[47:07] Rants and things and they say oh stick
[47:09] to the topic blah blah blah get to the
[47:11] point this is the point okay because
[47:13] you're going to if you're not trading
[47:14] with life money right now inconsistent
[47:16] you're going to have these things come
[47:17] up in your own thinking and they're
[47:19] going to be barriers so what when that
[47:21] happens you're going to be wanting to
[47:22] email me okay or you're going to wrestle
[47:25] with it and not know how to deal with it
[47:26] when I first started back when I was 20
[47:29] years old I'm looking at the market
[47:31] thinking if I can get to the point where
[47:32] I could save $1,000 a
[47:35] month by the time I'm in my 40s I won't
[47:37] need to work now obviously you I didn't
[47:40] factor in inflation all that stuff but a
[47:42] million dollars by 40 you know that was
[47:44] enough for me to get to work and focus
[47:45] on learning how to do
[47:48] this contrast that with what you see on
[47:50] YouTube today follow my signal service
[47:54] join my
[47:55] mentorship I made $60,000 in one trade
[47:59] here's the proof here's the withdrawal
[48:00] here's this here's
[48:03] that that is not something that is
[48:06] sustainable and it's such a
[48:09] wild unicorn that just pops up once in a
[48:12] while you don't see these people pulling
[48:13] out $60,000 consistently every single
[48:16] week that's not happening okay but I'm
[48:19] pulling out $6,000 a week consistently
[48:23] now that's not a lot of money it's not
[48:26] but I'm quite confident in saying that I
[48:28] think that the majority of you and I'm
[48:30] talking the high 90% of you could live
[48:33] pretty nice on $6,000 a
[48:36] week will the market continuously offer
[48:38] me
[48:40] $6,000 I don't know I haven't traded the
[48:43] indices in a long time but I traded
[48:45] these
[48:46] markets 30 years ago okay and I know
[48:50] them so I'm not scared of them I'm not
[48:52] scared of the volatility I love it but
[48:55] if you look at the relationship ship
[48:58] of how these negative trades give me
[49:02] Intel they give me Insight because I'm
[49:04] trying to get a read on the next swing
[49:07] on that daily chart these are all small
[49:10] little Investments on me getting a
[49:11] better read on that see you think that
[49:14] your trading accounts never going to
[49:16] have any of these in them when these are
[49:19] to a informed Trader someone that's
[49:21] seasoned that knows what they're doing
[49:24] they'll invest in their own Trading
[49:28] think about what I'm telling you you're
[49:30] investing in yourself to get more
[49:32] information that you can't collect just
[49:34] by watching the price action so you got
[49:36] to get a closer feel for it and you
[49:38] invest and you put something in the
[49:39] marketplace now there are trades and
[49:43] I've mentioned this uh I'm not sure
[49:45] which video it was in the mentorship but
[49:47] I did one and they were losing trades
[49:49] they were they were wrong ideas they
[49:51] were absolutely wrong ideas not all of a
[49:54] losing trade record is errors and that's
[49:59] how it's important because if you just
[50:00] look at somebody's you know trading
[50:03] statements or
[50:05] or well yeah their positions and and
[50:08] their statements that's not going to
[50:10] give you the context that would be
[50:12] required like I could look at someone's
[50:14] statement and say okay yeah they're
[50:16] making money but in reality unless I
[50:20] look at what they're doing on a chart
[50:22] they could be lucky they could be just
[50:24] getting lucky and this today was me
[50:28] investing in trying to get a feel for
[50:30] what I think is going to happen on the
[50:32] next few days worth of data and I'll
[50:34] throw in a couple trades where it
[50:38] doesn't matter to me if I'm losing and
[50:40] sometimes when I do this they're winning
[50:42] trades but they're not meant to be
[50:45] winning trades or losing trades it's
[50:46] just me getting a read on it now when
[50:48] you do a micro account okay it wouldn't
[50:51] be this much money and you may not trade
[50:54] with this style this I know many of my
[50:56] students don't do this because they just
[50:58] don't think it's a worthwhile investment
[51:00] but those same traders that are under my
[51:03] toist are not capturing 100 plus handle
[51:05] moves in these indices either so it's a
[51:08] tradeoff okay what is it you're trying
[51:10] to do what are you trying to accomplish
[51:12] I'm not trying to get 10 handles you
[51:14] know on a lot of contracts and scalp
[51:16] scalp scalp okay I know what I'm looking
[51:19] for and
[51:21] this this tab over here where it says
[51:23] profit and losses I don't care how much
[51:25] money I deposit in the account the
[51:27] broker will never put that money in that
[51:30] tab so when you read people making
[51:33] comments on the internet and I have a
[51:35] few of them in the in the previous video
[51:37] that I mentioned and showed today where
[51:38] I was showing my Live account logging
[51:40] into in the whole show they said that
[51:42] I'm adding money and this is reflecting
[51:44] the additions and that just proves that
[51:46] these people have no idea what a live
[51:47] account looks like they've never seen
[51:48] one in their life no broker ever would
[51:52] ever reflect deposits in the profits and
[51:54] loss category that would never happen
[51:57] and this is absolutely profits and in
[51:59] organizations like the cftc would
[52:01] literally come after me or anybody else
[52:04] if that wasn't real money I'd be
[52:06] breaking the law by saying it is real
[52:08] money that's real profits right there
[52:11] okay these
[52:13] trades here I cleaned up all of
[52:18] this with that trade right there okay
[52:21] but I I want to give something that I
[52:22] think and believe that is realistic my
[52:26] int intentions are not to run this
[52:27] account up to a million dollar because I
[52:29] don't think that you learning from this
[52:31] YouTube channel that that is
[52:34] realistic can some of you do it well the
[52:38] sky is not the limit okay I've on record
[52:41] many times saying that I have students
[52:43] that do very very well I have students
[52:45] that don't make money at all now you
[52:49] might be an exception I don't know that
[52:52] you may believe it I don't know okay but
[52:55] the things I'm teaching on this YouTube
[52:57] channel I have faith in that's the only
[53:00] thing I'm showing you here I'm not
[53:01] saying look what I can do so therefore
[53:03] you can do it too I cannot promise you
[53:06] that you're going to get the same
[53:08] results in fact I'm promising you that
[53:10] you won't get the same results as me
[53:13] okay but I try to trade this account
[53:16] with the expectation also that I don't
[53:19] want it to
[53:21] be consistently over and over again
[53:23] where it's just too good to be
[53:25] believable because I want you to be able
[53:27] to see these statements at the end of
[53:29] the year and look at them and refer to
[53:31] them and say you know what there's these
[53:34] times in the market in certain months
[53:36] and certain days where there was draw
[53:38] down in this account and it came out of
[53:40] that draw down and look where it ended
[53:42] for the year look where it ended for
[53:43] each
[53:45] month that is
[53:48] tangible real world help when you feel
[53:51] like if you have a losing streak or if
[53:53] you have losing trades and you look at
[53:54] someone that's been able to use the
[53:56] logic that I'm teaching you and still
[53:58] correct it now I can correct the draw
[54:01] down intraday because I know how to
[54:02] trade very well I'm not bragging it's
[54:04] just the
[54:05] facts if I know what I'm looking for
[54:09] whatever draw down I have and I can
[54:11] correct the intraday draw down that I've
[54:13] had on the chart if we look at how the
[54:15] market can give us these opportunities
[54:18] and you can see that this trade
[54:20] here there's that entry at
[54:23] 14,505 and a half right there
[54:29] 14,622 and
[54:31] 3/4 right here that was the sell that
[54:34] was the exit here's the commission costs
[54:37] here's the fees and here's the
[54:38] commission that TDM trade takes out and
[54:41] here's the return on that one trade 2345
[54:48] $2,345 that cancels out all of the
[54:50] leaders I put in to get a feel for it
[54:53] and I pocketed $1,100 for one day for a
[54:57] short amount of time I could have held
[54:59] it I could have done that using what I'm
[55:02] teaching you
[55:03] here but I'm trying to teach by example
[55:07] so that way you don't look at me do
[55:10] unrealistic things that you can't do
[55:12] right away do I believe someone that has
[55:14] put a year into trading and studying
[55:17] what I'm doing with this mentorship can
[55:19] trade like this I personally believe yes
[55:23] but does that mean that you are all
[55:25] going to do it no
[55:27] if I didn't believe you could do it I
[55:28] wouldn't be up here doing it okay the
[55:31] logic is being shown to you I showed you
[55:33] in the charts how I use the S&P to time
[55:35] my NASDAQ trade and here are the
[55:38] actual history this is this is it okay I
[55:41] got asked Today Show this okay here it
[55:43] is do the numbers here add them up and
[55:46] then add it to that profit and look at
[55:48] the video I just posted today and some
[55:50] of you going to say oh this is
[55:52] a you said uh
[55:54] photoshopped pH phoshop thing because
[55:56] it's on your PowerPoint I do PowerPoint
[55:58] because I'm not having to worry about
[56:00] hiding my user number because if I hide
[56:03] that then you can't see all the the
[56:04] other details down here I think it's
[56:06] what turns off so I want to keep
[56:07] everything so you can see it so it just
[56:09] allows me to not worry about
[56:11] it but
[56:14] nonetheless I want you to think about
[56:18] how daily bias is not an everyday bias
[56:22] that's going to work in your favor some
[56:24] days I go in I'm expecting like last
[56:25] night I preferred to see the market go a
[56:27] little bit lower and it didn't deliver
[56:29] so I had to make adjustments and then I
[56:31] caught myself on the right side of the
[56:33] daily
[56:34] range exiting where I teach you getting
[56:37] in where I teach you right there there's
[56:40] logic it's that's the proof okay um
[56:44] there will be days where I try to do
[56:46] this and I'm going to have a losing day
[56:48] it will happen I will not be able to
[56:50] corrected it will be a losing negative
[56:52] day when that happens the first instance
[56:55] that that happen s I'm going to show you
[56:57] it okay I'm not trying to hide the
[57:00] losing days but the trader in me the
[57:04] person that is
[57:06] ICT I refuse if I have the capability I
[57:09] refuse to let my negative day stay
[57:12] negative at the close now you might look
[57:14] at that as oh well you're you
[57:17] know you can't accept the losing trade
[57:19] and you're trading emotional that's
[57:21] nonsense this is someone that's got
[57:24] three decades of experience and I know
[57:25] how to fix it so if you knew how to fix
[57:27] it wouldn't you do it right
[57:30] so again everybody's going to have an
[57:33] opinion and everybody's going to have a
[57:35] way of thinking how they need to be
[57:37] taught but I've been doing this for a
[57:39] very long time and I'm not going to
[57:41] change my style so the order of which
[57:44] I'm teaching it the topics I'm talking
[57:47] about the way I'm showing it to you in
[57:50] the charts that's how I'm trading I'm
[57:52] putting the trades on based on that
[57:53] logic so that way you can see I have
[57:56] faith in this you may not have faith in
[57:59] this you may never take these trades you
[58:01] may never ever put any effort into
[58:04] learning them you're just watching this
[58:05] like it's a Netflix binge watching scen
[58:07] you
[58:09] scenario okay that's cool but this is
[58:13] something that is transferable I can do
[58:15] it it will repeat to answer your
[58:17] questions I'm getting a lot of comments
[58:19] also and I'm going to close the video
[58:21] here the algorithms are not going to
[58:24] change because ICT is teaching teaching
[58:26] you how to navigate with
[58:30] them
[58:32] period why am I trading these markets
[58:34] when I'm supposed to be the Forex Guru
[58:37] well if you look at Forex Forex is going
[58:39] real quiet it's sideways so I'm going to
[58:41] trade this Market also as a compare and
[58:44] contrast I've been doing this Market a
[58:46] lot
[58:47] longer than
[58:48] Forex again I started with these markets
[58:52] here and bonds which when we get into uh
[58:56] May and June I'll probably trade some
[58:57] Bonds in here as well give you some tips
[59:01] on on how that market Works a little bit
[59:03] too but hopefully you got something from
[59:06] this I was a little all over the place
[59:07] but I wanted to be relaxed and and
[59:10] communicate a lot of things that were
[59:12] coming to me by way of the comment
[59:14] section I appreciate all of your
[59:16] comments I appreciate all of the
[59:18] feedback you guys are giving me um just
[59:19] so you know I know some of you are
[59:21] probably leaving these sweet Sugar Rush
[59:23] uh comments and really really lavishing
[59:25] me with adoration I'm not trying to put
[59:29] those comments I always accept one
[59:30] comment for each video as a way of you
[59:33] know saying I liked your comment you
[59:34] know I think that's a a significant
[59:36] comment that I think the community would
[59:38] appreciate not just oh this is you know
[59:40] loving ICT um I appreciate all of that
[59:45] but just know that those types of
[59:46] comments are never going to be allowed
[59:48] to be shown um I I'm holding all the
[59:52] comments for review because I still have
[59:54] some terrible things being said to me to
[59:56] me that are not true and I'm not going
[59:57] to give a stage for that okay um in
[60:00] closing if anybody out there says that
[60:02] they're doing trades that are live and
[60:04] they making $220,000 a day or whatever
[60:06] and they're not doing it in a simulator
[60:08] let them Show You by logging into a live
[60:10] account and doing it like this I'd be
[60:11] interested to see that also until next
[60:13] time be safe
