[00:08] all right folks welcome back so this
[00:11] lesson is going to be a little bit
[00:11] shorter more direct to the point and
[00:14] we'll be looking at some
[00:16] examples since I showed you uh what
[00:18] we're looking for on Tuesday night so
[00:21] Wednesday's trading and Thursday's
[00:22] trading we'll take a look at
[00:26] that all right first up is the EM mini
[00:29] S&P March delivery contract for
[00:32] 2022 Wednesday January 26th once you
[00:36] take a look at this low over here okay
[00:38] and don't just use my charts you want to
[00:40] look at your charts and go through it
[00:43] from your platform your broker whatever
[00:47] feed that you're
[00:48] using this is trading view it's a free
[00:51] charting package when it's end of data
[00:54] but if you want to have real time I
[00:56] think I'm paying $4 a month for the data
[01:00] it's not really expensive but you want
[01:03] to have the low over
[01:05] here on Wednesday the 26th and you'll
[01:09] see why I picked that low there
[01:12] because it's the low okay and then this
[01:15] is the high so we have this price run
[01:17] from this low to this High that's our
[01:20] range so you want to drop your FIB on
[01:22] that now get your equilibrium price
[01:25] point
[01:26] so as the highs we're r
[01:30] through we have that run up the market
[01:33] gets pushed into a premium it's really
[01:36] expensive and then we want to wait to
[01:38] see does it break down below the old
[01:41] high it does but does it create a fair
[01:44] value Gap in here no then it rallies one
[01:47] more
[01:48] time then breaks down
[01:51] again inside here there's a break-in
[01:54] Market
[01:57] structure we see it here
[02:00] then it runs back up into the fair B Gap
[02:03] here and then sells off reaching
[02:07] into this old
[02:09] low which would be
[02:12] below the equilibrium price point of
[02:14] this entire range or 50% level on the
[02:20] FIB okay put some lipstick on this again
[02:24] here's the low and the high equilibrium
[02:28] which is a 50 level and the 50 Bach so
[02:31] we're looking for a low or an imbalance
[02:35] below this level okay so we have a swing
[02:39] low here we have an imbalance here that
[02:42] could be a Target notice how we hit it
[02:44] there and came off of it more pronounced
[02:48] low
[02:50] here and draws down into that so inside
[02:53] this shaded Blue Area we're going to
[02:54] take a closer look at the
[02:58] details okay we're zoomed in a little
[02:59] bit again still on a 2-minute
[03:01] chart previous High short-term high and
[03:05] 8:30 in the morning that starts the hunt
[03:08] basically that's what 8:30 in the
[03:09] morning is to me so we're looking for an
[03:11] old high to be violated it does so
[03:14] here then it breaks there's a break-in
[03:17] Market
[03:20] structure swing low this candle over
[03:23] here that sets the stage now you have a
[03:25] opportunity does price draw back up into
[03:28] the fair value Gap after this candle
[03:30] breaks below here and giving you a
[03:33] bearish market structure shift yes it
[03:35] trades up in the ne value Gap you can go
[03:36] short there and again you could Target
[03:39] this old low here or that low that was
[03:43] annotated before we zoomed in and look
[03:46] at the beautiful delivery there so
[03:49] hypothetical short from here and
[03:52] hypothetical cover here you would log
[03:55] that in your study Journal don't use my
[03:57] examples here alone go into your own
[03:59] charts and an them as
[04:00] well so shorting around we'll
[04:04] say
[04:06] 4419 and covering
[04:09] at we'll say
[04:11] 4382 just to
[04:13] be you know not perfect that's the
[04:17] opportunity of the range but you don't
[04:20] have to have all of that it's still very
[04:22] very nice delivery based on the logic I
[04:24] taught you on Tuesday and the first
[04:26] lesson on the previous week's Friday
[04:29] again there's that fair Val you
[04:32] got and that's your candle that would be
[04:36] considered as a ideal
[04:39] entry and the discount hold low as a
[04:42] Target right there so your charts would
[04:45] look just like this in any open space
[04:47] like over here you would just type in
[04:49] whatever important factors that you
[04:51] found insightful about this example how
[04:54] long did it take okay how long did it
[04:56] take from the market structure shift
[04:59] occurr ing how much time did it take to
[05:01] get up into the fair value capap that's
[05:03] real important how long did it take
[05:05] before it went from your entry down to
[05:07] your Target in
[05:09] time how much heat or Draw down would
[05:13] you have weathered getting
[05:16] short now if you used this candle's high
[05:20] as your entry point you technically
[05:22] could have got filled
[05:23] here but in here I want to teach you to
[05:26] look at the total range available and in
[05:29] hindsight okay because it gives you a
[05:31] framework to look for how these examples
[05:33] while they're not exactly the same they
[05:35] don't repeat exactly photocopy of every
[05:37] single previous instance of it there's a
[05:40] lot of similarities that you'll find
[05:42] that are reoccurring and that's the
[05:44] important factor to train your eye to
[05:46] see it remember the analogy I gave you
[05:49] on Tuesday night about the deer track
[05:51] and being a hunter you have to know what
[05:53] a deer track looks like you have to know
[05:55] what a deer track is to stalk it
[05:56] effectively well this is your pattern
[05:58] and setup so you need to go in looking
[06:00] for it so it reinforces the idea that
[06:02] you know what it looks
[06:05] like all right we're looking at the e-
[06:07] mini nasac futures for Thursday January
[06:09] 27th 2022 this is a 5 minute chart this
[06:13] is the time frame you start with and you
[06:14] work down okay so on the 5 minute right
[06:19] away we can see the low to the high and
[06:24] we're looking
[06:25] for a high and go back in time in your
[06:29] chart
[06:30] and you'll find what this is here but
[06:32] you have these relative equal highs as
[06:34] well so that could have been a initial
[06:36] objective looking for these relative
[06:38] equal highs to be taken out and does it
[06:40] break down and give you a fair value Gap
[06:42] no it doesn't so it wouldn't even meet
[06:43] the criteria there I know some of you
[06:45] might be looking say well how do you
[06:46] know it doesn't get you on a trade here
[06:48] listen to the rules I gave you they're
[06:50] very specific and that's what I'm
[06:52] walking you through here that way you
[06:53] can see it's kind of allowing the market
[06:55] or really forcing the market to show you
[06:59] its hand and once it does that then you
[07:01] can go in and act accordingly but you
[07:03] have to wait for the setup you can't
[07:05] force it you can't think it's there it's
[07:07] there or it's not so we have old High
[07:09] Here by liquidity resting above that and
[07:11] we have a run above it once it goes
[07:12] above here doesn't go above it and break
[07:15] down and then go down below that
[07:16] short-term low there no it goes higher
[07:19] so we just keep waiting for a break
[07:22] lower to get a shift in the market
[07:24] structure on an intraday basis so we
[07:26] have a swing low
[07:27] here it trades down through it on this
[07:30] candle here so right away at that moment
[07:33] on this candle soon as this candle
[07:35] trades through it you now have an
[07:37] opportunity then you go back into the
[07:39] high to that candle low and do you see a
[07:43] fair value Gap it's right
[07:45] there okay this Market rallies back up
[07:48] trades into it here you can be a short
[07:51] seller there and the market breaks down
[07:54] one more time ret trades back into it
[07:57] and reaches below the equilibrium price
[07:58] point he has a couple targets here you
[08:01] could be
[08:02] here here or in the inbalance and it
[08:05] hits all of them and goes a little bit
[08:06] further
[08:12] lower all right so that was quick and
[08:15] hopefully painless and again we're
[08:17] looking at internal range liquidity and
[08:19] Market structure shifts intraday my
[08:22] advice is for you to go back through
[08:24] more data use the weekend that's coming
[08:28] and acquire more of those examples so
[08:31] that way you can include them in your
[08:33] study Journal next week I'll work on
[08:36] targeting refinement and entries until
[08:40] I'll talk to you then enjoy your weekend
[08:41] and be safe
