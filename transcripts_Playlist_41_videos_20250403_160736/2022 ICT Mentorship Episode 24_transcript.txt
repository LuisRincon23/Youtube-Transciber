[00:05] all right folks welcome back
[00:08] this is going to be episode 24
[00:10] of the continuing series of the free ict
[00:13] mentorship
[00:14] on youtube for 2022.
[00:17] all right so i want to kind of like sit
[00:19] you down for a minute get your attention
[00:22] because if you don't have the proper
[00:23] mindset for this one this could be taken
[00:25] out of context
[00:27] and viewed in the light that is not
[00:29] really my aim
[00:30] okay
[00:31] so i want you to think about
[00:33] why are you even watching these videos
[00:36] are you trying to learn
[00:38] are you just entertaining yourself or
[00:40] are you here
[00:41] to try to be disruptive because if
[00:43] you're trying to be disruptive
[00:45] i don't have any time for that so i want
[00:47] you to understand what i'm going to show
[00:49] in this video this is not going to be
[00:51] a repeating theme i just want to let the
[00:54] foundation be laid here
[00:56] if i see any comments that are
[01:00] either disrespectful
[01:02] or just
[01:03] meant to stir up
[01:05] chaos and and create a ruckus
[01:08] i'm just gonna
[01:09] ban you from the town and your post
[01:10] won't appear okay
[01:12] the comment section is open
[01:15] you guys said i don't open the comments
[01:17] up i've been opening them up all the
[01:19] mentorship videos are open okay
[01:21] i use your comments to
[01:23] steer the future direction of the
[01:26] lessons
[01:27] i try to incorporate things that you may
[01:29] have asked or shown a concern about
[01:32] respectfully
[01:34] if this is not for you
[01:36] then obviously you can go watch tom dick
[01:38] and harry go play in market replay okay
[01:40] that's fine but here
[01:42] i'm teaching you things that actually
[01:44] work in the live markets i'm not
[01:46] pulling some strings that to make you
[01:48] feel like you you're learning something
[01:50] that is a gimmick this is real market
[01:53] delivery those of you that are really
[01:55] sincere about learning obviously you
[01:57] have a lot of work ahead of you
[01:59] and we are in the development stages
[02:02] early on in this mentorship so that
[02:05] means you have to understand that this
[02:06] is the
[02:07] discovery
[02:09] where you see this pattern you're
[02:10] supposed to be going back through the
[02:12] data in your old charts
[02:15] not trading
[02:16] not even demo trading
[02:18] okay
[02:19] you're looking for this pattern through
[02:22] back testing
[02:23] now some of you have asked to do a back
[02:26] testing
[02:27] episode i will do
[02:29] a back testing episode okay
[02:32] but
[02:33] i want you to understand you have to
[02:34] have the proper mindset here you have to
[02:36] be responsible
[02:38] you have to be
[02:39] attentive and you have to listen
[02:41] so the things i'm teaching the things
[02:43] i'm saying suggesting to you
[02:47] you have to make them
[02:49] applicable to your own journey you can't
[02:52] just watch and think okay i've seen him
[02:54] do this
[02:55] a few times in a video i understand it
[02:56] so i'm gonna go out there and try to do
[02:58] it
[03:00] so i i want you to understand in light
[03:02] of that
[03:04] idea or
[03:07] direction that some of you want to take
[03:10] just know that that's not the proper way
[03:11] of doing it okay
[03:14] so some of you are unaware that this is
[03:16] the other part of
[03:18] the ict experience so when i'm
[03:22] communicating to community here
[03:24] not only am i doing it in the
[03:27] comment section
[03:28] very very rarely
[03:31] but i also talk
[03:32] on the community posts and if you go on
[03:34] the youtube go to my youtube channel
[03:36] and
[03:37] click on this little area right here
[03:39] you'll see it it's kind of like my
[03:41] twitter
[03:42] like my
[03:43] update area sometimes i'll prompt you to
[03:45] look at certain charts
[03:47] or i'll
[03:48] encourage you
[03:50] give you ideas to think about you know
[03:52] where you are in your journey
[03:54] and sometimes i'll share a youtube
[03:56] channel for a specific video
[04:00] it's not meant for you to be able to
[04:02] talk to me here
[04:04] but you can obviously say anything you
[04:05] want in the comment section just know
[04:07] that if it's something that's
[04:08] disrespectful you can say whatever you
[04:10] want on your last post
[04:12] okay because i'll just make you
[04:13] invisible you won't be here anymore and
[04:15] you can keep creating accounts and i
[04:17] don't care it just takes one little
[04:18] click of a button for me you got to go
[04:20] through the whole overcoming row of
[04:21] email addresses and all that business
[04:23] and you know
[04:25] i don't get tired of clicking hitting
[04:27] ban i don't get tired of doing it it's
[04:29] really easy in fact it's fun
[04:31] but this area here
[04:35] is the other segment of the mentorship
[04:37] so
[04:39] with that in mind
[04:41] i made this post a little while ago
[04:44] and today's date is may 5th 2022 and i
[04:47] know some of you try to remind me to
[04:49] make
[04:50] these posts with the date
[04:53] and i just don't i don't remember it so
[04:55] i'm used to doing twitter and twitter
[04:57] used to do a time and date stamp all the
[04:59] time
[05:01] it's just i'm a
[05:03] creature of habit like anybody else i
[05:05] don't really think about it when i'm
[05:06] doing it
[05:07] but i made this post this morning
[05:09] i said good morning constant reader
[05:12] i know right that fomc was pretty neat
[05:15] huh
[05:15] now try this one
[05:17] open your nasdaq 15-minute chart and
[05:20] e-mini s p 15-minute charts
[05:23] drop a horizontal line across those
[05:24] smooth criminal highs in both index i'll
[05:27] explain what that is in a moment
[05:30] see how we dropped into a discount
[05:31] overnight study how they treat those
[05:33] relative equal highs today and
[05:36] non-farm payroll friday
[05:38] as you were so i'm encouraging all of
[05:40] you to open up your charts and interact
[05:43] okay because some of you just want to
[05:44] watch my videos and that's it and think
[05:47] it's going to translate from just
[05:48] watching and then now you know how to do
[05:50] it no you got to get in and study it
[05:54] so i prompted everyone to look at their
[05:56] chart this is kind of like what i was
[05:57] drawing your attention to now as one
[05:59] caveat here that little blue arrow
[06:02] that is me drawing the specific so that
[06:05] way we know what we're talking about
[06:07] here where my
[06:08] attention was
[06:10] really drawn in on this
[06:12] i'm watching this i got that little
[06:14] bubble there that little gap right there
[06:18] i'm watching and i'm waiting for that to
[06:19] drop down
[06:21] at 9 30. that's that little
[06:23] judas swing okay i'm waiting for that
[06:25] judas swing to happen where it drops
[06:26] down at 9 30. if it goes into that area
[06:29] there and then it creates displacement
[06:33] then it looks for a fair value guy and
[06:35] if it trades back down into a fair value
[06:36] gap inside that displacement
[06:39] then i can go long and i'll look for a
[06:41] run into that 4303 okay
[06:45] i did not
[06:47] tell my mentorship
[06:49] last night that i wanted to do this very
[06:51] thing here
[06:53] but
[06:54] if i was going to tell my mentorship
[06:56] anything
[06:57] this is what i would have said
[06:59] okay i would like to see it drop down
[07:01] into that area and then create the model
[07:04] that i'm teaching here on the youtube
[07:06] channel
[07:07] now
[07:09] read what it says here it says you are
[07:12] studying
[07:13] this
[07:14] and i am watching
[07:16] this
[07:18] okay
[07:20] pray tell does this
[07:22] in any manner whatsoever
[07:25] suggest
[07:26] in any
[07:28] manner at all
[07:29] that any of you should be buying or
[07:31] selling this
[07:32] no it doesn't
[07:38] for years i've been asked to do live
[07:40] sessions i've been asked to trade live
[07:43] in front of people
[07:44] okay
[07:46] the number one reason why i have
[07:48] refrained from doing it
[07:50] is what we're going to talk about next
[07:52] because
[07:55] responsibility is lacking
[07:58] predominantly across
[08:02] all countries
[08:03] all age
[08:06] and demographics it's simply something
[08:08] that most people in trading lack okay
[08:13] now it's going to be very easy for me to
[08:15] sit in front of a chart and say this is
[08:17] what i think is going to happen i think
[08:19] it might go up to this level or go down
[08:20] to that level
[08:21] that is not a trade idea that's just
[08:23] bias it's logic
[08:25] that's the extent
[08:27] that's the extent of what i'm gonna do
[08:29] in the live sessions
[08:31] the reason why i already said that in
[08:33] the beginning and i didn't change gears
[08:35] because of what i'm gonna talk about
[08:36] tonight but this is important
[08:38] okay mindset is absolutely crucial if
[08:41] you young guys and gals in here are
[08:43] already bored
[08:44] do yourself a favor
[08:46] turn
[08:47] this video off don't ever watch another
[08:50] video by me
[08:51] because you're going to cheat yourself
[08:53] from the absolute best prevention
[08:57] of ruin
[08:59] if you continuously try to just watch my
[09:01] videos
[09:02] pay
[09:03] intermittent attention
[09:05] and then think you're going to glean any
[09:07] real understanding because this is
[09:09] highly technical i have simplified it
[09:12] and you're going to see
[09:14] two very simplified approaches to what
[09:16] i'm trying to teach so that way i can
[09:17] get right to the point but
[09:19] these are the parts
[09:21] that cause people that don't want to
[09:23] listen
[09:24] they don't want to pay the attention to
[09:26] the things i'm teaching you
[09:28] these are the parts that will hurt you
[09:30] if you don't understand it
[09:32] do you want to succeed
[09:35] because to succeed you need this part
[09:38] not the little patterns not the little
[09:40] things i can draw on a chart that stuff
[09:43] that's the smallest part of it
[09:46] how you think about yourself what you
[09:48] think you're capable of doing
[09:51] and the management and observation and
[09:53] respect of risk
[09:56] is going to determine what your success
[09:58] is going to be
[09:59] i wish i could grab you by your lapels
[10:02] and just shake you and say listen this
[10:04] is the part you need to learn
[10:06] it's not full of lamborghinis
[10:09] it's not full of patek philippe
[10:11] watches and flossing in front of
[10:13] everybody
[10:16] i talk to you this way because i
[10:19] genuinely care about your success
[10:22] that's all that's all i want you to be
[10:24] able to do is take this information the
[10:26] logic
[10:27] and do well with it
[10:30] i'm not trying to bore you or burn
[10:32] through minutes just for the sake of
[10:33] hearing myself talk i want you to
[10:35] understand
[10:38] and some of you simply don't want to
[10:40] listen
[10:46] have to be a critical thinker
[10:48] i'm training you to be a critical
[10:49] thinker
[10:51] i'm going to give you two examples
[10:52] tonight of
[10:54] what critical thinking is not
[10:59] all right this individual here it was in
[11:00] the comment section
[11:02] okay
[11:02] and this is
[11:04] the poster child
[11:06] for why i do not sit in front of people
[11:09] and trade with
[11:12] entry stop targets i don't do that
[11:15] because invariably
[11:17] someone's going to take something i'm
[11:19] doing
[11:20] or saying
[11:21] or applying to a chart
[11:24] and they're going to do something with
[11:25] live funds
[11:27] and they're going to come out and say
[11:28] just lost a thousand thanks a lot
[11:32] now i don't know who this person is this
[11:34] person may not have actually taken a
[11:36] trade and lost money this person may be
[11:38] a troll this person may be a genuinely
[11:40] sincere individual
[11:41] at this point i don't care
[11:44] but i want to highlight this is the very
[11:46] thing folks this is it this is the thing
[11:49] that prevented me all these years to sit
[11:52] in front of all of you and entertain you
[11:55] with trading
[11:57] because someone's going to do something
[12:00] and when they do something
[12:02] by their own actions
[12:05] and it's painful for them if they lose
[12:08] money
[12:09] guess whose fault that is
[12:11] because it's not mine
[12:13] it's the person that lost the money
[12:17] listen
[12:18] everything i teach here
[12:20] is under the guise of
[12:22] demo and paper trading
[12:24] that's compliance
[12:25] i don't give trade advice
[12:28] i can talk about where the market's
[12:29] going to go i can give my opinion about
[12:30] that market opinions that's not trade
[12:32] advice it's the same logic the same idea
[12:36] in the same
[12:37] language
[12:38] that all of my paid mentorship students
[12:40] sign an agreement and they give me
[12:42] indemnity they know going in that
[12:45] everything i'm saying is
[12:47] under the pretense of demo
[12:49] and paper trading and you can't make
[12:51] money with demo trading but guess what
[12:53] you can't do either you can't lose money
[12:54] either
[12:56] so it gives you that freedom to think
[12:58] about what you're doing
[13:00] without the tug of war of making and
[13:02] losing money
[13:04] some of you
[13:05] in here are so high strung and so
[13:08] impatient that you just want to go out
[13:10] there and say okay
[13:11] i'm going to watch this video i'm going
[13:13] to get a hint from ict like i'm giving
[13:14] you some kind of secret language for
[13:16] signal service and i say this stuff to
[13:18] my own paid mentorship i said it for six
[13:20] years every time there was a new group
[13:22] coming in
[13:24] they know there is no new group coming
[13:25] in and stop listening to these yahoos
[13:27] out there saying that i'm gonna start
[13:28] another mentorship and i'm gonna sell
[13:29] i'm not selling no more mentorships
[13:31] folks
[13:32] because of this kind of stuff okay i'm
[13:34] not doing it
[13:36] so
[13:37] whether this person lost a thousand
[13:39] dollars
[13:40] or didn't i don't care
[13:42] that right there is why i have prevented
[13:45] myself
[13:47] saying no i'm not going to do it because
[13:49] i know there's going to be a lot of you
[13:50] out here that are going to hurt yourself
[13:52] because you're not ready none of you
[13:53] should be trading this model with live
[13:55] funds we haven't even gotten through all
[13:56] of the content or the the process of
[13:59] what it is you're doing with it
[14:01] today you're getting another piece of it
[14:03] but this is the crucial part this is the
[14:05] stuff
[14:06] the boring stuff the things that you
[14:08] don't want to listen to the things that
[14:10] you want to go through the people that
[14:11] want to come in here later on and say
[14:13] here's a minute marker when he starts
[14:14] really teaching and you want to avoid
[14:16] the crap i will delete your posts if you
[14:18] do stuff like that it's disrespectful
[14:19] not only to me but the other viewers
[14:21] because you're
[14:22] really taking their attention away from
[14:24] what is the real lesson
[14:27] you're all entitled to your opinion but
[14:29] if your opinion is disruptive or
[14:30] disrespectful i won't let it post
[14:34] now you can disagree respectfully and
[14:36] those posts stay on the comment section
[14:39] but nonsense that's meant to start a
[14:41] ruckus
[14:42] your channel will be blocked
[14:46] then you have folks like this
[14:49] who cannot be taught
[14:50] now again this could be a troll this
[14:52] could be someone that didn't really take
[14:55] a trade today because really the logic
[14:57] as i'm going to prove tonight
[14:59] really wasn't in the marketplace today
[15:01] for this model
[15:02] and it can't be argued there's no way
[15:04] you're going to be able to say
[15:06] that what i posted this morning is lined
[15:08] up with any of the logic that this model
[15:10] uses
[15:13] so
[15:15] again
[15:16] this person
[15:18] may have done something foolish
[15:20] or maybe they're just here to
[15:22] troll
[15:23] that's fine it doesn't matter because
[15:25] the posts that were made even after this
[15:27] indicate that the person's really not
[15:29] properly
[15:30] prepared to learn how to do this and or
[15:32] really not interested in learning so
[15:34] they're going to get removed
[15:36] they may come back in another form but
[15:38] any disrespectful comment will be
[15:40] removed
[15:44] this
[15:45] statement right down here at the bottom
[15:46] highlighted take accountability for your
[15:48] actions
[15:50] if you're taking trades
[15:52] number one you gotta take it you gotta
[15:53] take accountability for your actions
[15:56] those are your actions i didn't reach
[15:58] through the screen i didn't go to your
[15:59] house i didn't go to your apartment i
[16:02] didn't meet you at your job and press
[16:03] your cell phone to get you into a trade
[16:05] in fact i didn't tell you anybody about
[16:07] a trade i said study
[16:10] watch i'm watching this
[16:13] okay
[16:14] that is not indications that's not
[16:16] instructions to buy or sell anything
[16:20] so don't get caught up in all this
[16:22] frenzy to be pushing any buttons yet
[16:24] because none of you know what you're
[16:25] doing
[16:28] all right i appreciate your patience
[16:30] getting through that how to get it off
[16:31] my chest
[16:32] and i promise i won't do it again
[16:34] because it's already been done here
[16:36] just know that if you act like those
[16:39] individuals
[16:40] i won't see your posts
[16:42] all right so
[16:44] may s p we won't cover tonight but it's
[16:46] kind of similar to what this is showing
[16:48] here but the e-mini nasdaq 100 features
[16:51] june contract delivery month
[16:53] 2022 this is a daily chart
[16:56] and
[16:57] i felt that
[16:59] this morning we could have
[17:01] popped through
[17:02] stabbed above these relative equal highs
[17:05] right in here and then created this run
[17:07] lower that's kind of like what i was
[17:09] prompting study that because if it
[17:11] happens
[17:12] you can see and study and back test now
[17:15] that the market's already moved you can
[17:16] go back in and look and see if the model
[17:18] in fact did
[17:20] what i teach
[17:21] now
[17:22] this is actually a good lesson because
[17:24] it shows where i'm looking for something
[17:27] to form
[17:28] but it doesn't form it doesn't create a
[17:31] losing trade it doesn't get me into
[17:33] something that causes me to
[17:36] buy it when there really isn't
[17:38] an entry pattern there
[17:40] this is the
[17:41] proof the evidence that the model has
[17:44] validity so if you have a valid
[17:48] reasonable
[17:50] sound logic behind the model whatever
[17:52] model that is
[17:53] then it should prevent you from taking
[17:56] bad trades not all the time but
[18:00] sometimes when there is a really big
[18:02] move going the other direction that you
[18:03] don't see or expect
[18:07] it may do its job and keep you from
[18:09] getting into those bad traits
[18:11] and i'll show you the logic here today i
[18:14] want you to be a critical thinker okay
[18:17] think about what i've already taught
[18:18] about this model
[18:19] in the comment section below
[18:22] if you think that this model appeared
[18:25] based on what i showed in that community
[18:27] post say so
[18:29] if you don't think that this model
[18:31] appeared based on what i showed then say
[18:34] so as well
[18:36] also i'd appreciate if you would include
[18:37] in your post where are you all from
[18:39] folks like i want to get like a a broad
[18:43] range view of how far i'm reaching i
[18:46] know i got a lot of people in different
[18:47] countries but all you just tell me what
[18:48] country you're from you don't have to be
[18:49] specific with your address or social
[18:51] security number i'm not that interested
[18:53] but i would like to know you know where
[18:54] everyone's from
[18:56] but here's the logic with that one hour
[18:59] chart and that relative equal high
[19:01] so this is the framework i'm looking for
[19:04] a run above here if it can get above
[19:06] that then what it could
[19:08] wash out and go lower
[19:11] why would that be possible in terms of
[19:15] a
[19:16] pattern or a setup or the logic what
[19:19] would be
[19:21] the catalyst for that what like what was
[19:24] the reasoning for you being interested
[19:26] in these relative equal highs number one
[19:29] it's thursday
[19:31] it's thursday and it's ahead of non-farm
[19:33] payroll friday now nine farm payroll
[19:35] friday is usually a volatile day it can
[19:38] be messy it can be sloppy sometimes it's
[19:40] just a really just a dud it doesn't
[19:42] really do anything
[19:43] other days it could be extremely
[19:45] volatile like the fomc but because fomc
[19:48] has done what it's done
[19:50] i don't think that the non-farm payroll
[19:52] numbers is going to have that much
[19:53] impact
[19:54] but
[19:55] i was looking for
[19:57] these relative equal highs to be taken
[19:59] out
[20:01] then
[20:02] drop lower than create the model that
[20:04] i'm teaching so that's why it's kind of
[20:06] drawing your attention to them so that
[20:07] way if it did present that you can have
[20:09] something to study
[20:10] now
[20:11] what's the catalyst that sets the run up
[20:14] into those relative equal highs i'm
[20:15] going to talk about that now
[20:19] much like i was suggesting in that post
[20:21] we had dropped down
[20:23] into a discount
[20:25] i posted ahead of the 9 30 opening where
[20:28] equities open up and that
[20:31] volatility that comes around 9 30 i want
[20:34] to see some kind of a manipulation in
[20:36] price so if our focus and i was trying
[20:38] to get your attention up here if our
[20:40] focus is up there and it's dropping down
[20:42] and it's ahead of 9 30 what are we
[20:45] likely to see
[20:46] drop down get traders thinking it's
[20:48] going to go lower
[20:50] and then rally up not just go down
[20:52] indiscriminately and then go higher it's
[20:54] got to do something specific
[20:56] i'm interested in this area right here
[20:58] that's what i posted in that community
[21:00] post saying i'm watching this and that
[21:02] was that little area right here
[21:04] for all of these
[21:05] videos that i've been posting it's very
[21:08] specific i'm teaching fair value that
[21:11] that fair value gap is right there okay
[21:14] so dropping down into that that would be
[21:17] a point of interest for me so that i can
[21:20] go in and look for something that gives
[21:22] me my setup so in other words this here
[21:24] is just
[21:26] where
[21:27] the trade might form
[21:29] hear what i just said
[21:30] where the trade might
[21:33] it could
[21:34] it may
[21:36] not it's absolutely going to
[21:38] this is a promise there's no way this
[21:40] can fail because that logic doesn't
[21:42] exist in trading except for over
[21:45] leverage and
[21:48] over trade you're gonna blow your
[21:49] account that's
[21:50] a guarantee okay
[21:52] but that fair value gap that's the place
[21:55] in terms of price where should the
[21:58] pattern form
[22:01] by itself it's just price but we have to
[22:03] incorporate what element first
[22:05] algorithmically it's time
[22:08] so i'm teaching you elements of time at
[22:10] that 9 30.
[22:12] we're expecting some volatility
[22:14] dropping down into that area here
[22:17] which at this point at the chart it
[22:19] doesn't do yet
[22:21] so i'm looking for it to drop down into
[22:23] that area if it does then i'm going to
[22:25] be looking for what i teach you in this
[22:27] model
[22:29] so with that area shaded
[22:31] right here
[22:32] this is a 15 minute chart you can see we
[22:35] traded down into it
[22:37] the candle stopped right at the old
[22:40] candle high
[22:41] and the next candle just gave up the
[22:43] ghost
[22:44] right away
[22:46] we should notice that we did have the
[22:48] initial criteria which is trading below
[22:50] an old low
[22:51] so what's going to be resting below that
[22:52] cell stops
[22:54] so they go down run out the sell stops
[22:57] traders are caught in
[22:59] then what what's the next logic we got
[23:01] to look for displacement it's got to
[23:03] trade back above
[23:05] this old low it's got to have
[23:08] displacement above that
[23:10] did it happen here
[23:12] no
[23:15] here is a five minute chart
[23:18] now if you're looking at this with that
[23:20] same low here it trades down below it
[23:22] did we get displacement above that oh
[23:25] low
[23:26] no
[23:27] it just went down consolidated returned
[23:30] back to it
[23:31] but melted didn't do anything above that
[23:33] oh low there was no displacement no
[23:36] energetic move so that way you can look
[23:38] for a fair value gap to trade back down
[23:40] into the buy
[23:42] so
[23:42] anyone that would have looked at this
[23:44] and bought today
[23:46] is not using what i'm teaching they're
[23:48] just impulsively pushing a button and if
[23:51] they lost money
[23:53] you have to fault yourself for that
[23:56] i'm not the good i'm not going to be the
[23:57] target for all of you that fail
[24:01] don't listen and want to gamble and when
[24:03] it doesn't work for you because you took
[24:05] a guess you took a stab at it you just
[24:07] wanted to see what was going to happen
[24:09] and you lose money
[24:11] you can never do that with me even my
[24:13] paid mentorships
[24:15] those students they can't do any of that
[24:16] either
[24:17] because i never tell them to go into
[24:19] anything and buy or sell anything
[24:21] nothing
[24:23] i'm not going to co-sign your financial
[24:26] ruin it ain't going to happen
[24:28] none of this can be placed on me the
[24:30] responsibility is solely on you the
[24:32] viewer
[24:34] and it's
[24:34] a lot of responsibility and some of you
[24:37] simply are not going to be able to do
[24:38] this
[24:39] not because it doesn't work but because
[24:41] you are not responsible you don't have
[24:43] any self-control
[24:45] you don't want to listen you don't want
[24:46] to have any rules
[24:48] in those rules
[24:50] look at it like this folks
[24:52] in the videos
[24:53] i'll suggest folks hey look pause the
[24:55] video here study it so that way you can
[24:57] really look for it before it's revealed
[24:59] there's a lot of people they make jokes
[25:01] and say i'm not going to pull i'm not
[25:02] going to pause the video
[25:03] i promise you if they're sincere in
[25:05] their response saying that i promise you
[25:08] they will not learn this okay it will
[25:10] not happen because they're showing
[25:13] a
[25:14] a trait that is simply
[25:16] not conducive for success in doing this
[25:19] business so it doesn't work like that
[25:21] it's not easy it's not netflix and chill
[25:24] it's
[25:25] ict and study your ass off okay that's
[25:29] the way it is and it takes a lot of
[25:31] logic that you have to adhere to
[25:33] and you have to break yourself
[25:36] there's a lot of things you're going to
[25:36] try to do impulsively if you do them
[25:39] here and it works for you you make
[25:40] profits you're going to be in here in
[25:42] the comments section high fiving me yeah
[25:45] we're killing ict style
[25:48] when in fact you just got lucky
[25:52] because then the next time you take
[25:53] another trade impulsively
[25:56] you're going to want to fault me
[25:58] you're going to say you weren't around
[26:01] when i posted that comment this morning
[26:03] i spent the day with my wife i haven't
[26:05] seen her for a week
[26:07] and i'm not obligated to babysit anybody
[26:09] through a community post
[26:10] i don't even do that with my mentorship
[26:12] that pay me
[26:13] okay so
[26:14] again it's all about responsibility
[26:17] and i'm placing
[26:19] the logic in your hands it's up to you
[26:21] to go through the charts see if it fits
[26:23] you if it doesn't fit you folks there's
[26:25] a lot of other ways to trade
[26:27] there's lots of ways to trade you don't
[26:29] need to trade my way okay
[26:31] i'm biased i believe mine's the best
[26:34] i believe i can outperform anybody in
[26:36] any style of trading and i can do it
[26:38] consistently
[26:40] will that translate to you no
[26:44] but i'm saying and promising that you're
[26:47] going to learn how to read price better
[26:49] than you ever imagined
[26:52] it's worth the investigation
[26:54] look into it see if it doesn't hold up
[26:58] but don't do things outside the rules
[27:00] i'm giving you
[27:02] and that's why i teach this way slow
[27:04] incremental pieces
[27:05] because invariably
[27:08] you're going to do things impulsively if
[27:10] you lack self-control if you don't have
[27:13] self-control you're going to blow up
[27:15] and folks listen there's nothing worse
[27:18] than thinking you understand something
[27:19] in a rush
[27:21] and then go out there and trade with
[27:22] live funds and blow the account
[27:24] it hurts
[27:26] it's painful it sucks
[27:30] and it's easy to say oh it's that guy
[27:32] that wasn't there to tell me what's
[27:34] really going on you know if he would
[27:35] have told me
[27:37] this or that i wouldn't have lost money
[27:40] no
[27:41] because
[27:42] i'm never putting any of my students in
[27:43] a position where they have to be
[27:45] handheld
[27:46] through a trade
[27:47] they're putting their self in that if
[27:49] they did it at all
[27:50] and they gotta get themselves out of it
[27:52] that teaches responsibility
[27:55] and you have to own those results good
[27:57] or bad they're yours
[27:59] and that's why i tell everybody when
[28:01] they find success in this and they like
[28:02] to say hey it was
[28:04] it was all credit to you ict you know
[28:06] without you i couldn't have done this
[28:08] wrong
[28:10] wrong
[28:11] the only thing i did
[28:12] was show you how to read price i did not
[28:15] sit with you and push a button
[28:17] so if you took on that risk
[28:19] if you sat through the learning and
[28:21] worked through all the back testing and
[28:23] studying and forward testing demoing and
[28:26] producing a track record that you can
[28:28] feel confident in then and only then
[28:31] with the time that you choose not when i
[28:33] say so because i never tell anybody with
[28:34] live funds in fact right now i'm
[28:36] reminded don't trade with life funds
[28:40] when you make that decision should you
[28:41] ever do so
[28:43] you've done it on your own accord
[28:46] so if you make money
[28:49] whose success really is that
[28:51] it's yours
[28:53] and it's well deserved
[28:55] never
[28:56] ever
[28:58] champion me for your success
[29:01] now you can thank me for helping you
[29:02] with the logic but i didn't help you
[29:05] make money
[29:06] and just this well i did not help you
[29:09] lose it either
[29:11] those buttons getting pushed
[29:12] you push them
[29:14] and you have to sleep with yourself
[29:16] knowing that that's the results that you
[29:18] provided
[29:19] and there it is
[29:20] you live with it and if it's
[29:23] a bad taste in your mouth
[29:25] swallow
[29:26] it's the way it is
[29:28] it's bitter medicine but it's good for
[29:30] you you'll learn from it or it'll take
[29:32] you out of the business and that might
[29:33] be the best thing for you
[29:36] if you can't stick to the rules
[29:39] this game has a funny way of taking you
[29:41] right out of it
[29:44] the people that are consistently
[29:46] profitable
[29:47] it's not by luck
[29:49] and they're not stupid
[29:50] they have a logic they adhere to
[29:53] they have rules that they trade with
[29:55] and they have to stick to them when they
[29:57] deviate from them or do something
[29:59] outside of what that role-based strategy
[30:02] is
[30:03] then
[30:04] it's reasonable to expect ruin or loss
[30:08] and those moments are most painful
[30:10] because you can look back and say this
[30:12] is not what i should have done
[30:15] that's what i shared that other guy
[30:17] corbs video about
[30:19] i'm sure he has a strategy
[30:22] but for whatever reason
[30:24] from his commentary he suggested that he
[30:26] just lost control of himself and started
[30:28] doing things that made no sense
[30:30] anybody that's ever traded with life
[30:31] funds knows exactly what that means
[30:34] if anybody has ever treated life funds
[30:37] they understand what that man was saying
[30:39] i know i've done it a lot in the 90s
[30:42] i know exactly what he was talking about
[30:45] but it feels like it's never going to
[30:47] work and you just want to pick yourself
[30:49] up
[30:51] you're going to have losing trades folks
[30:53] okay
[30:53] in your journal right now today with
[30:55] today's date
[30:57] make a promise to yourself write it out
[30:59] i promise
[31:01] that as long as i'm doing this i'm going
[31:03] to endure losses
[31:06] notice i said indoor
[31:08] you're not going to be defeated by those
[31:10] losses
[31:12] you're just going to have to endure them
[31:14] because trading is all about
[31:16] managing losing trades
[31:18] you got to trade your way out of a
[31:19] losing trade every single time you get
[31:21] into market every single trade as soon
[31:23] as you start off you're under the
[31:24] commission you're under the spread in
[31:26] forex
[31:27] you got to come out of that
[31:30] every trader is a losing trader that
[31:32] finds success
[31:33] out of loss
[31:36] or
[31:37] suffers ruin
[31:38] in it
[31:41] that's it that's the only two things
[31:42] that can happen
[31:46] all right so now let's talk a little bit
[31:47] about the model and give you a little
[31:49] bit more details and i probably feel
[31:51] like i beat you up and you're like man
[31:52] this is depressing this is not what i
[31:54] was hoping to hear
[31:56] i promise it was good stuff for you okay
[31:59] now i want to talk about where do these
[32:01] setups form
[32:03] so in your journal
[32:04] this is like a subtitle area for this
[32:07] video
[32:08] where do
[32:10] setups form
[32:11] okay think about that for a minute
[32:14] when you're looking for this idea that
[32:16] i'm sharing the fair value got where
[32:17] would you expect them
[32:19] to appear in price obviously i've been
[32:22] teaching you
[32:23] to run above an old high or relative
[32:24] equal highs and if you're bearish that
[32:27] would set up a scenario where the market
[32:29] goes up
[32:31] sweeps the highs
[32:32] breaks back down below the highs
[32:35] short-term lows taken out with
[32:37] displacement and then you go back
[32:38] through that displacement leg looking
[32:40] for a fair value guy to short into
[32:44] that's pretty simple logic isn't it well
[32:46] visually i want you to understand it
[32:48] okay so that way in your mind i do this
[32:50] exercise all the time with my students
[32:53] can you draw out with a diagram like if
[32:55] you were at work and you're trying to
[32:56] explain to your friend or co-worker what
[32:59] it is you're looking for in price now
[33:00] they're not going to understand what
[33:01] you're doing but
[33:03] how would you draw it out in price or in
[33:05] a napkin with a pen or pencil what would
[33:07] it look like
[33:09] well you have obviously a level
[33:11] of relative equal highs and we're just
[33:13] going to use that green line as an
[33:15] example of that
[33:16] and price is moving towards it
[33:19] small little correction or so
[33:21] it runs
[33:23] towards it again
[33:26] and then finally it runs through those
[33:27] relatively highs okay at that moment as
[33:30] soon as it goes above it you start
[33:32] panning back through
[33:35] all this price running here and find the
[33:37] nearest
[33:38] short term low
[33:40] because that right there is going to be
[33:41] your trigger
[33:43] it's not that it goes above this old
[33:45] relative equal high and then goes down
[33:47] below that that's not it folks
[33:50] that's not it you have to see it go
[33:53] below that and displacement with the
[33:55] energetic move
[33:56] take out a short term low
[33:58] that's how you filter out these trades
[34:01] that may not be
[34:03] high probability
[34:06] so that area right there as soon as you
[34:08] run above the relative equal highs in
[34:10] your mind you're looking for where's the
[34:12] trigger
[34:13] because until it takes out that short
[34:15] term low
[34:16] there's nothing going on
[34:18] there's no trade there there's no set up
[34:21] there
[34:22] then when there's displacement that
[34:24] displacement leg and price action
[34:27] that right there is your foundation to
[34:29] the setup that's it once you have that
[34:31] then you can go into that area
[34:33] and look for the fair value guy
[34:36] that's the logic
[34:37] that's the pattern that's what you're
[34:39] looking for this is if it's bearish now
[34:42] if those relative equal highs would have
[34:44] been traded through this morning
[34:46] i would have expected this scenario
[34:48] okay
[34:50] before
[34:52] it ran those relative equal highs
[34:54] i was looking for
[34:56] like down here
[34:57] price was trading down into that area i
[34:59] was showing you my interest today i'm
[35:00] watching this where it was likely to go
[35:02] down to
[35:03] this is kind of like the low in my mind
[35:06] i'm kind of using it as an example
[35:07] what i was expecting price to do once it
[35:09] got down into that fair value gap that i
[35:11] was saying i'm watching this that little
[35:13] arrow okay i showed that little gap i
[35:15] was expecting this type of movement to
[35:18] set up the run above those relative
[35:19] equal highs but there was no movement
[35:21] here to set up that run either
[35:24] so
[35:25] two scenarios that i would have loved to
[35:28] seen
[35:29] develop just did not pan out it just
[35:32] simply wasn't there
[35:35] now i'm going to teach you another
[35:37] approach and this is kind of like what i
[35:38] was expecting and
[35:40] had it panned out this morning if it
[35:42] would have gave the real setup which it
[35:43] did not i've already shown that that
[35:45] little fair value gap that i was waiting
[35:47] to see a response in it didn't do it
[35:49] just melted right through it
[35:51] but if it would have done
[35:53] this but this is going to be the cell
[35:54] version okay just reverse it for the
[35:56] going long idea
[35:58] if you have a old fair value gap above
[36:00] you
[36:01] okay so you have an old fair value you
[36:03] got and the market's below it and it's
[36:05] trading up
[36:06] and you're bearish but you think it's
[36:08] going to go up that fair value gap the
[36:10] same logic when it trades up to the
[36:11] relative equal highs
[36:13] once it trades into
[36:15] that fair value gap
[36:18] it doesn't have to completely close it
[36:20] if it trades up into it
[36:22] anywhere between here and here is good
[36:24] okay
[36:25] it trades above it you can really make
[36:27] it simple and say okay the low of the
[36:28] fair value got treat that like the same
[36:30] logic that you use for the relative
[36:32] equal highs
[36:33] doesn't that make it simple and easy
[36:35] that way you don't have to worry about
[36:37] how hard do i need to know you don't
[36:38] need to know that
[36:39] because you're waiting for something to
[36:41] happen what is that
[36:42] once it takes out the low of the fair
[36:44] value gap and trades in there you go
[36:45] back through that leg and see okay
[36:47] here's what there's that trigger
[36:50] that's that shift in the market
[36:51] structure you're waiting for then you
[36:53] have the displacement leg
[36:54] so once you have that you can go back in
[36:57] and look for the fairway
[36:59] okay so
[37:01] that's the two entry strategies
[37:04] for this model
[37:05] there's no
[37:07] other way of worrying about what does it
[37:09] look like this now visually this is what
[37:11] you're doing okay it's simple if it
[37:15] feels like it's not simple watch this
[37:17] part of the video a couple times and
[37:18] then go back and look at price action in
[37:20] live data and in old back testing go
[37:23] back and look at old moves and you'll
[37:25] see this logic is there okay
[37:27] it's algorithmic it repeats
[37:30] unfortunately today it didn't give me
[37:32] the setup to allow myself to sit down
[37:34] with you tonight and say okay this is
[37:35] what i did because i was going to trade
[37:37] it okay i was going to enter at the low
[37:39] run the highs go short and write it down
[37:41] that way too i was going to do it
[37:44] but
[37:44] nothing panned out
[37:46] it didn't mean that the models broke it
[37:48] doesn't mean that the models broke it
[37:50] doesn't mean that i can't find winning
[37:52] trades it just means that the market did
[37:54] not provide the structure to allow this
[37:57] to form
[37:58] does it result in a losing trade no
[38:01] because the logic wasn't utilized that
[38:03] would have put me in a losing trade
[38:05] it never formed
[38:08] this right here reverse the logic here
[38:10] apply it that's the homework apply this
[38:12] logic here
[38:14] does this appear
[38:17] in the fair value that i was drawing
[38:18] your attention to this morning on the
[38:19] community post
[38:21] no
[38:22] and no one can manipulate and say it was
[38:26] it just wasn't there folks
[38:28] so
[38:29] it's just a missed move and there's
[38:32] nothing you can do about it
[38:34] except for beat yourself up and say oh i
[38:36] wish i woulda coulda shoulda
[38:39] and that stuff doesn't make you money
[38:41] and it doesn't take any more money out
[38:43] of your pocket so don't do it
[38:45] don't waste time doing that it's toxic
[38:47] thinking so hopefully i don't need to
[38:48] bring up all this negativity anymore and
[38:50] address any of it like this because i'm
[38:51] never going to entertain it in a video
[38:53] again but i want to lay the foundation
[38:55] and
[38:57] provide my response to
[38:59] anybody that would think like this or
[39:01] say this whether they're trolling
[39:02] whether they are sincere whether they
[39:04] feel like they've been victimized okay
[39:07] you've done that to yourself if you
[39:09] pushed a button and you entered trade
[39:11] you did that
[39:12] nobody in this community
[39:14] including me chief of all of them
[39:16] never told you to buy or sell anything
[39:19] you're never going to have instructions
[39:20] where i'm telling you to buy or sell
[39:21] anything
[39:23] it's always going to be study this
[39:25] observe this watch this
[39:27] that's that's what i'm saying
[39:29] they're not code words for anything
[39:30] they're specific elements of study
[39:34] put your attention here watch and see
[39:36] observe
[39:37] is there any characteristics repeating
[39:39] with the logic that i teach that's not
[39:42] trading okay that's not trade advice
[39:44] that's not investing advice that's not
[39:46] money management advice it's just
[39:49] practicing reading price action
[39:52] and that's how i teach
[39:54] it might not be for you
[39:56] maybe you want me to drive around in
[39:58] lamborghinis and and lie to you about
[40:00] stupid stuff that ain't gonna work in
[40:01] the market
[40:03] that's just not what i'm gonna do that's
[40:04] not me
[40:05] i do things in the charts that make
[40:08] sense
[40:09] i teach it it's transferable knowledge
[40:12] but you have to be prepared
[40:14] to receive it
[40:16] study it practice it
[40:18] and endure all these times where you
[40:21] look for something to be there
[40:23] and it doesn't happen and then a move
[40:24] takes place that you've missed
[40:28] that's the test are you going to lose
[40:30] your mind
[40:31] because you missed a big move like today
[40:34] i used to do that when i was younger
[40:37] and it got me nowhere but backwards
[40:42] don't
[40:43] live in your losses
[40:48] missing moves is a loss
[40:51] taking a monetary loss in the market is
[40:53] a loss
[40:54] taking a demo trade that's a losing
[40:55] trade that's a loss
[40:58] the mental impact on that
[41:00] you have control over
[41:03] you can decide to amplify every bit of
[41:05] that
[41:06] or you can say you know what
[41:08] what can i take from this
[41:10] so that way i can never
[41:12] be hurt this much again by it because it
[41:15] will repeat
[41:16] but you have to be able to condition
[41:18] yourself so that way when these
[41:20] knocks
[41:21] and
[41:22] trips and falls and setbacks when they
[41:25] occur i've been here before
[41:27] that way it doesn't completely derail
[41:29] you
[41:30] that's an important lesson and
[41:32] unfortunately no one really touches that
[41:34] because they all pretend that they never
[41:36] make mistakes and they always catch the
[41:38] runs
[41:39] and i'm just not that kind of guy i'm
[41:41] honest i'm gonna tell you
[41:44] if that doesn't fit you again
[41:46] change the channel until next time
[41:48] be safe
