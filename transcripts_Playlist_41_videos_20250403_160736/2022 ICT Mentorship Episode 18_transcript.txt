[00:05] all right folks welcome back this is
[00:06] episode 18
[00:07] of the continuing series of the ict
[00:10] 2022 youtube mentorship all right so we
[00:13] are looking
[00:14] at the euro dollar
[00:18] and what you have here is how i have my
[00:21] trade layout this is what i work with
[00:23] while
[00:24] utilizing my charts through trading view
[00:28] and don't be intimidated because you may
[00:30] not be able to do this with
[00:32] your trading view uh there's a
[00:36] i think there's a membership level you
[00:37] have to have and again i'm not trying to
[00:39] promote i don't get anything for you
[00:41] signing up with tradingview i don't have
[00:43] any affiliate programs nothing like that
[00:46] i don't have any
[00:47] you know programs that i'm trying to
[00:48] pitch
[00:49] i just like the service okay i pay for
[00:52] it out of my pocket you don't have to
[00:53] owe me any favors so
[00:55] but
[00:57] i have it set up like this when i'm
[00:59] looking at the marketplace
[01:02] the upper left hand corner now you you
[01:04] can do this with individual charts and
[01:05] you'll see what i mean by having one
[01:08] laptop one screen
[01:10] if you do what i'm going to show you
[01:11] here today you don't need all these
[01:13] screens but
[01:15] i've been asked to show this both in my
[01:17] private group
[01:18] and in the youtube community
[01:21] what do my charts look like when i'm
[01:23] going through the motions of
[01:26] looking for trade setups and how do i
[01:28] navigate from higher time frame down to
[01:30] the lower time frame and how do i work
[01:31] with daily bias and what do i do with my
[01:33] charts to streamline the analysis from
[01:36] high time frame to low time frame
[01:38] i'm going to show you that in this
[01:39] lesson here
[01:42] all right so
[01:43] upper left-hand corner is always going
[01:44] to be the daily chart as you can see
[01:46] here daily now
[01:48] if
[01:49] you're looking for bias
[01:51] you're going to start your analysis here
[01:54] now you can do it with the chart
[01:56] maximize like this start working with it
[01:58] doing all of the business that you would
[02:00] expect to have
[02:01] in your chart and we'll do this here
[02:06] shout out to my mentorship group private
[02:09] group
[02:10] i mentioned this
[02:12] on wednesday's midweek commentary
[02:15] a little bit of hindsight
[02:18] done right
[02:19] so we
[02:20] have fair value gap there
[02:24] and notice that it has this high
[02:26] that low and a higher high many of you
[02:29] would see that
[02:31] as my bearish breaker
[02:34] it's not okay so
[02:37] look at this here
[02:39] which is lower
[02:42] is it
[02:44] this low here
[02:46] or
[02:47] the discount low of the fair value gap
[02:49] in other words this candle is high
[02:52] clearly it's this candle's high
[02:55] so i'm going to tell you something i
[02:56] told my private group last night because
[02:58] i can tell it to you now
[02:59] it's not advantageous to you
[03:02] it was advantageous for them because
[03:04] they knew about it
[03:05] yesterday but
[03:07] i'm showing you this because i have
[03:09] a lot of witnesses that i said this
[03:11] before it happened because i know some
[03:12] of you out here
[03:13] unless you were there watching it okay
[03:16] you just simply won't believe it and
[03:17] that's fine i'm not here to convince
[03:18] every single one of you you're either
[03:20] going to believe it or you're going to
[03:21] watch somebody else's channel as simple
[03:22] as that
[03:23] but
[03:24] the fair value gap in here
[03:27] i mentioned that we would likely draw up
[03:28] into that
[03:30] and then look for lower prices now
[03:33] let's step
[03:34] by step walk through
[03:37] a scenario using what i'm teaching you
[03:39] in this mentorship on the youtube
[03:41] channel okay
[03:42] i responded to a
[03:45] lady on the comment section of i think
[03:48] it was the most recent video so forgive
[03:49] me if it isn't that video but i know i
[03:51] mentioned
[03:52] uh
[03:54] a response to her question was more or
[03:57] less i'm gonna paraphrase
[03:58] it can i touch on or teach
[04:02] a specific
[04:04] approach to trading
[04:06] or can i mention rather
[04:08] a specific style of trading that if i
[04:11] only had to pick one way of doing it one
[04:13] style of trading
[04:15] that
[04:16] obviously hits all the time
[04:18] well there is no method
[04:21] that hits every single time okay
[04:23] everything that i trade with and teach
[04:26] is like everything else it's imperfect
[04:29] that means there's going to be losing
[04:31] transactions largely because of the
[04:33] operator
[04:34] me or whoever else is using it
[04:36] and you have to take ownership of that
[04:38] it takes a great deal of responsibility
[04:40] and
[04:41] i kind of lectured on that in my private
[04:43] group on wednesday
[04:45] it doesn't feel good to hear those types
[04:47] of woodshed
[04:48] lectures
[04:50] but it's something i needed when i was
[04:51] younger
[04:53] but
[04:53] if i was going to use one particular
[04:55] approach to trading like say i was
[04:57] starting completely over
[04:59] didn't know anything
[05:01] but i discovered like say this youtube
[05:03] channel
[05:04] knowing what i know
[05:07] about all the things that i can utilize
[05:09] in trading
[05:12] the reason why i stripped it all down
[05:14] and created the model
[05:16] like it is
[05:18] and you're going to see more of it being
[05:19] applied here today so it gives you like
[05:21] a a step-by-step approach i know some of
[05:23] you were asking can you just
[05:25] kind of like show me what it is i'm
[05:26] trying to do in the charts like what am
[05:28] i looking for what's what's a way of
[05:31] back testing you know how can i go
[05:33] through and look at old data i'm going
[05:35] to show you something here but it was
[05:37] also given to my community
[05:40] yesterday okay
[05:41] and if i see a bunch of comments in the
[05:44] comment section saying that it wasn't
[05:46] really done i'll just simply upload the
[05:48] video
[05:49] and prove everybody that says that wrong
[05:51] so i'm ready i'm ready for it so
[05:54] the long short is it's not a big deal
[05:56] it's not a huge trade but it's proving
[05:58] prognostication it's proving that number
[06:01] one i've already hinted that this thing
[06:02] was likely to go lower anyway
[06:04] and we've seen it go lower
[06:07] but
[06:08] utilizing the model
[06:11] this model here in the youtube 2022
[06:14] mentorship
[06:17] that to me
[06:18] is the easiest and i would just do this
[06:21] i wouldn't worry about doing anything
[06:23] with like
[06:25] uh central bank dealer's range okay i
[06:27] wouldn't worry about doing anything with
[06:28] asian range i wouldn't even worry about
[06:30] doing anything with
[06:32] the
[06:35] well
[06:36] there's a
[06:37] anything else unless i've mentioned it
[06:39] in this model
[06:41] i wouldn't even do any investment of
[06:43] time at all because this literally is
[06:45] the simplest way to work with intraday
[06:49] and
[06:50] daily order flow
[06:53] it's simple it really is this simple
[06:56] it doesn't feel sexy though i know some
[06:59] of you young guys are like yeah but wait
[07:01] till he starts bringing out all the
[07:02] really hard-hitting
[07:04] you know gadgets and such you're going
[07:06] to be floored by that no you don't need
[07:08] it i don't want my daughter inundated
[07:09] with all that stuff number one she's
[07:11] really not interested in trading so i'm
[07:12] trying to convince her that she can do
[07:14] this
[07:15] with something it's very simple it's
[07:17] streamlined
[07:18] so what does that mean by streamlining
[07:20] it and what is the step-by-step process
[07:24] because i already told you the bias i've
[07:25] had on this
[07:26] currency when i taught one tuesday i
[07:30] gave you a 4x lesson
[07:31] i showed you an example with the euro i
[07:34] said it's likely to draw into this low
[07:36] here now here's the wonderful thing
[07:39] we don't even need it to go down to that
[07:42] low to find profitability
[07:45] how's that
[07:46] how is that possible
[07:49] how are you able to
[07:51] responsibly handle
[07:53] daily bias
[07:55] work with a higher time frame and then
[07:57] frame out a setup
[07:59] using the logic that i'm showing you in
[08:00] this model let's do that now number one
[08:02] the bias
[08:03] is bearish
[08:05] so if a bearish bias is being
[08:07] implemented okay in other words you're
[08:09] using that in your analysis you're going
[08:11] through the charts looking for setups
[08:13] that would
[08:14] warrant a short sale
[08:17] on this particular market or this pair
[08:19] in forex
[08:20] what i'm showing you here
[08:23] all of this
[08:24] up to now if i make a transition to
[08:26] index futures trading i'll mention
[08:29] certain caveats when it comes to that
[08:31] but for now everything i'm saying in
[08:33] this video
[08:34] until i say otherwise is pertinent to
[08:38] forex
[08:39] okay so it's specific to 4x
[08:42] all right so
[08:44] bias is
[08:45] bearish
[08:46] and we're looking at a daily chart so
[08:47] you start your analysis there you have a
[08:49] fair value gap here
[08:51] so
[08:52] it can trade up into that and all you
[08:54] have to see is that candle traded to
[08:56] there now you can be greedy and try to
[08:59] trade all the way up into the middle
[09:00] point or deep into it maybe in complete
[09:02] closure
[09:04] i don't need that
[09:06] and we're gonna
[09:07] bring in the element of time of day
[09:10] and how that helps you decide
[09:12] what you're looking for and you don't
[09:14] really need to catch that high today
[09:16] either so i'm going to show you how to
[09:17] be forgiving with your entries
[09:20] the
[09:22] important thing is knowing what you're
[09:24] looking for ahead of time
[09:26] so that way you're not changing gears
[09:28] back and forth intraday
[09:30] chasing an impulsive price swing that
[09:32] may feel like oh i'm probably wrong let
[09:34] me chase this let me chase that
[09:36] when i showed the three months live
[09:38] trading account statements
[09:40] what some of you are not listening to
[09:43] when i say it in the video listen to the
[09:44] videos okay when i'm showing those
[09:47] statements
[09:49] i'm disclosing the fact that i'm getting
[09:52] questions by my students
[09:54] these folks have paid me
[09:57] okay they asked for me to show them
[09:59] things in a live account
[10:02] you are not privy to all of those
[10:05] conversations
[10:06] because you're not in that community
[10:08] so when they're asking me questions like
[10:10] what do you do if you get this this and
[10:12] this and this
[10:14] how would you work with that in in a
[10:16] real market i'm literally putting myself
[10:19] in a live account
[10:20] creating those very sim similar
[10:22] situations that they're asking me about
[10:25] and then
[10:26] moving out of those periods of either
[10:28] drawdown
[10:29] or
[10:30] how to overcome
[10:33] the
[10:34] anxious i don't want to take a trade i'm
[10:36] scared what happens if you take losing
[10:37] trades how do you overcome that
[10:40] a lot of those executions you're seeing
[10:42] is just simply me pushing a button to
[10:45] show that yes you can do those types of
[10:47] things to overcome initial fear
[10:50] it's going to cost you commission it's
[10:52] going to look like you have no idea what
[10:54] you're doing and there's people out
[10:54] there looking at these statements i've
[10:56] encouraged all of you to do it but it
[10:57] isn't going to mean anything to you
[10:59] unless you understand what i'm
[11:01] really illustrating there
[11:03] you're not the student that was spoken
[11:06] to in private with that live account
[11:08] showing that actual event unfolding
[11:12] so
[11:14] just know that there's a lot of things
[11:15] that are going on
[11:17] that
[11:18] are not necessarily your business okay
[11:20] the community here wanted to see a live
[11:22] account
[11:23] you see it on live account
[11:25] but working within a live account
[11:28] unless you do things like i'm going to
[11:30] show you here
[11:32] you're going to have this changing of
[11:35] direction intraday over and back and
[11:37] forth back and forth you're going to go
[11:39] up you're going to go down you're going
[11:40] to go back and forth
[11:41] and then it's gonna draw your account
[11:43] down or worse if you don't control
[11:44] yourself you'll blow the account
[11:47] so
[11:48] you have to commit to one direction
[11:50] that's your bias
[11:52] here's the thing
[11:53] your bias
[11:55] isn't going to be perfect and here's a
[11:57] news flash for you you as well i'm not
[11:59] always perfect with my bias either a
[12:01] bias is just an
[12:03] idea that you want to work within
[12:05] and employ your short sale when you're
[12:08] bearish or employ your long trade ideas
[12:11] when you're bullish
[12:12] and you're filtering out the other side
[12:14] of the marketplace unless you're proven
[12:17] clearly that you're absolutely wrong
[12:20] you just simply wait for these setups to
[12:23] form with that bias in mind
[12:26] now i know a lot of you are new and you
[12:28] want to see things taught to you that
[12:30] simply remove any chance of you losing
[12:33] there is no secret for that here
[12:36] nobody's going to teach that to you
[12:37] because it doesn't exist and frankly if
[12:40] someone had that i'll be real honest
[12:42] with you folks
[12:44] if i had a way that i would never lose
[12:47] i would have never came out publicly and
[12:49] became a teacher i would be the richest
[12:52] person you've ever met
[12:54] that's the god's honest truth that's
[12:56] exactly what would happen and if there's
[12:58] somebody out there that has some kind of
[13:00] a means of never losing
[13:04] they're doing that very thing they're
[13:05] never gonna talk about it they're never
[13:07] gonna teach it so
[13:09] you don't need to be perfect and i've
[13:11] proven imperfection still doubles the
[13:15] account
[13:17] it's simple
[13:18] and you can have a lot of losing trades
[13:20] and this is one of the things that one
[13:21] of my students asked they said what if
[13:23] your win rate is really really low
[13:26] can you still double an account
[13:29] yes because i was thumbing my nose at
[13:32] this idea that a risk to reward model is
[13:35] the essential for you to be net
[13:37] profitable that's not true
[13:39] i've proven that with a live account
[13:41] i have lots of things i'm going to show
[13:43] you with this td ameritrade account
[13:44] before the end of the year
[13:46] but just know that they're they're
[13:47] future lessons that i'm going to
[13:49] literally go through
[13:50] and show you not everything obviously
[13:52] because you're not i'm not obligated to
[13:54] show you everything that the other
[13:55] community is entitled to
[13:58] but i don't need to show you everything
[13:59] to see that account growing now
[14:03] the question is is what do you do
[14:06] if you're in a live account let's let's
[14:07] paint a picture for you okay
[14:10] say you're one of those individuals out
[14:11] there that have got caught up in the
[14:13] fever of all these funded account
[14:15] programs okay i'm not going to name any
[14:17] in particular because i don't have an
[14:18] affiliation with one i don't want an
[14:20] affiliation with any of them and i don't
[14:22] have any personal experience with my
[14:25] own trading with any of them okay so
[14:27] that way we know i'm not repping anyone
[14:31] there's no inside
[14:32] you know kickback for me none of that
[14:34] stuff
[14:35] but there's a number of them out there
[14:37] and my opinion of them is i have
[14:40] students that have gone through them and
[14:42] they are funded
[14:45] do
[14:46] i believe everyone should do that i
[14:49] don't personally believe everyone should
[14:52] uh but it is an avenue that you have to
[14:55] consider when you're in your own seat if
[14:58] you want to do that or not
[14:59] but let's assume that you've gone
[15:01] through the process and now you have
[15:03] passed whatever that
[15:05] you know
[15:06] i guess the challenge or whatever they
[15:08] call it to get funded and you found
[15:10] yourself with a let's say a hundred
[15:12] thousand dollar account
[15:14] in other words you have the ability to
[15:15] trade with what would be considered a
[15:17] hundred thousand dollars
[15:20] what process
[15:23] if it were me doing that okay that's i'm
[15:26] gonna speak in that
[15:28] perspective now i'm not saying you
[15:30] should do this notice what i'm saying
[15:32] here if it were me
[15:34] and i was starting out all over again
[15:38] i would use this model
[15:41] and i would go through the process of
[15:42] what i'm going to show you right now
[15:43] okay
[15:44] so
[15:45] bearish
[15:46] uh daily bias and i'm going through the
[15:48] daily chart and i'm looking at recent
[15:50] price action so we had
[15:53] this big drop down here
[15:55] drawing towards this low
[15:57] and then the next day we had this candle
[16:00] trade up here so that creates the fair
[16:01] value got
[16:02] so ideally
[16:04] you know what we've seen here we had one
[16:06] two three four
[16:08] five down days
[16:10] now there's likely to have a retracement
[16:14] because we've seen it come way down in
[16:17] terms of the range between this low
[16:19] and this high so what does that make
[16:21] that area down here
[16:23] premium or discount
[16:25] discount
[16:26] so
[16:28] as soon as this fair value gap forms we
[16:29] know that it's likely to see it
[16:32] rally up into this area here you know
[16:36] there's a short term little bounce
[16:38] that occurring
[16:41] and trading back to this candle's high
[16:43] is enough
[16:45] to set the stage for a new round of
[16:47] selling
[16:49] so you highlight your area on your daily
[16:51] chart
[16:52] and then
[16:53] look at what we have in terms of targets
[16:57] this is an ideal scenario that low
[16:59] but it's not likely to do that in one
[17:01] day can it do it
[17:02] absolutely but look at
[17:05] what is available in terms of targeting
[17:09] this day here
[17:11] it created the fair value gap so that
[17:13] means we can go in
[17:17] and note that low right there
[17:20] and we'll change it to blue
[17:22] here
[17:23] okay
[17:24] and we're going to put a little line
[17:25] segment here on this daily candle
[17:27] and we'll mark that one red
[17:29] okay so we have
[17:31] more or less a
[17:32] premium level that's being highlighted
[17:35] you can see it touches it but it
[17:36] actually goes above it just a little bit
[17:38] and that's all we'll need to justify a
[17:40] framework okay
[17:42] now
[17:43] let me recap real quick bearish bias
[17:47] we're likely to draw down to this low
[17:49] here why because we had one two three
[17:51] times like i mentioned on the video on
[17:53] tuesday or episode 17 if i'm not
[17:56] mistaken
[17:57] in this mentorship
[17:59] so it's likely to draw lower
[18:01] and dig into this low that's our draw on
[18:04] liquidity on the daily chart but is that
[18:06] your trade target
[18:08] no
[18:10] not for intraday trading
[18:12] so you frame your daily highs and lows
[18:15] previous daily high previous daily low
[18:18] so we have this day here
[18:20] you know yesterday's trading
[18:22] or what would be considered wednesday's
[18:24] trading
[18:25] and then thursday's trading we opened
[18:26] here we rallied up
[18:29] popped just above that short-term high
[18:31] and now because we've seen that
[18:34] we can target that daily low
[18:37] right here
[18:39] okay so this is the trading day on
[18:40] thursday we open rally up
[18:43] create a judas swing run back into this
[18:45] fair value gap
[18:46] and then expect it to sell off and then
[18:48] we can aim for that daily low why
[18:50] because anybody that went long in here
[18:52] who would want to do that there's always
[18:55] buyers and sellers
[18:56] okay so we're going to use previous days
[18:58] highs and lows like
[19:00] institutional mindset traders do there's
[19:02] lots of liquidity around daily highs and
[19:03] lows and high frequency trading
[19:05] algorithms attack previous day's highs
[19:08] and lows if you were back in the baby
[19:10] pitch days when i came in the scene 2009
[19:11] 2010
[19:13] that was the first lesson i started
[19:14] talking about is highlight the previous
[19:16] day's highs and lows and do that for the
[19:18] last three days
[19:20] if you do that you'll see a plethora of
[19:22] setups that you can do and that gives
[19:24] you liquidity pools that you can attack
[19:27] you there's always a fresh supply of new
[19:30] setups if you're looking at the last
[19:32] three days highs and lows it's always
[19:34] the case it's always going to be there
[19:36] you're never going to run out of trades
[19:38] ever okay
[19:40] so we have our framework here we have
[19:42] the actually let me change this blue
[19:48] to that green okay so we have premium
[19:51] and discount
[19:53] so
[19:54] these two levels are represented on the
[19:57] high and low
[19:58] of wednesday's trading which would be
[20:00] yesterday straight in other words your
[20:02] chart would have looked like this
[20:04] wednesday going into
[20:06] thursday before thursday started trading
[20:08] you'd have this so you would not mark
[20:10] your chart out like this so if we go up
[20:12] here
[20:13] and we enter this fair value gap that's
[20:15] your opportunity to go in looking for
[20:17] shorts
[20:19] then if it starts to go down you're
[20:21] targeting this low
[20:23] with the expectation why is it likely to
[20:25] do that because it may want to go down
[20:26] to this low
[20:28] but this gives you a nice range of
[20:30] profitability
[20:31] potential profitability
[20:33] so a range of we'll just call that
[20:35] 935
[20:37] to
[20:38] a low of what is it
[20:40] what's the low here
[20:46] 74. so
[20:48] 25
[20:53] 6 we'll call it 60
[20:55] 60 handles
[20:56] okay not bad that's a pretty respectable
[20:59] range can you get
[21:01] 25 pips out of that
[21:03] can you get 30 pips out of that how
[21:04] about 40 pips well we're gonna find out
[21:07] but this is the range of opportunity
[21:09] that exists looking at wednesday's
[21:11] trading and then thursday we open we
[21:14] rally up we bump that high like we would
[21:15] expect trading back into that fair value
[21:17] gap and then we watch price
[21:20] does it give us a setup what set up what
[21:22] i've taught you in this mentorship
[21:24] so we're going to drop down into
[21:27] the lower time frame if you have this
[21:29] layout like this so whatever you do in
[21:31] one chart it would appear in all the
[21:33] other time frames which is really nice
[21:35] this is one of the things that
[21:36] i'd like to use in trading view not that
[21:39] tradingview is the only platform because
[21:41] obviously you can do this with
[21:42] everything out there today but
[21:44] it's just really nice to be able to do
[21:45] this with all my students they can do
[21:47] the same thing
[21:48] but if you're working with one
[21:51] screen like a laptop and i'll answer
[21:53] this while i'm talking about it should
[21:55] you be trading on your phone no
[21:57] no you shouldn't can you manage a trade
[22:01] on your phone yes
[22:03] but entering a brand new position on
[22:05] your phone no
[22:07] you don't see enough data it's just too
[22:10] compressed
[22:11] and you need to be able to see
[22:13] the lay of the land okay you need to be
[22:15] able to open your chart up and really
[22:17] take in the information
[22:19] if you don't do that folks you're really
[22:20] just looking at a small little
[22:24] small little perspective really
[22:27] if
[22:28] you want to have advantages you you do
[22:31] it with a
[22:32] computer screen okay
[22:34] if you want to be handicapped
[22:37] then obviously try to trade on your
[22:38] phone okay
[22:40] i have not met anyone that has been
[22:42] consistently profitable and trading
[22:44] millions of dollars and they trade on
[22:46] their phone it just it doesn't work like
[22:48] that folks
[22:49] you got to be responsible you have to
[22:50] have some real estate and yes it
[22:52] requires a little bit of an investment
[22:54] but hey you don't need all kinds of
[22:55] things you don't need all the screens
[22:57] like i have and other people i have out
[22:58] there
[22:59] i'm showing you how you can do this at
[23:00] one screen one monitor so what would
[23:03] that look like obviously you can see
[23:04] everything i did on the daily chart is
[23:06] transposed
[23:08] onto the hourly chart down here in the
[23:09] lower left hand corner
[23:11] and
[23:13] it's transposed over here to the 15
[23:15] minute time frame so time frames our
[23:17] upper left is daily
[23:19] lower left is hourly and 15 minute time
[23:22] frame is only right the 15 minute time
[23:24] frame is my bellwether chart that's the
[23:27] one that i go to quickly
[23:29] i want to keep referencing that 15
[23:31] minute time frame throughout the day
[23:33] because the information i get from it
[23:36] which i'm going to show you
[23:38] is influential to me in terms of
[23:40] managing my position or hunting or
[23:42] stalking a new trade setup
[23:44] and also it helps me trust my intraday
[23:47] bias
[23:48] and i'll i'll explain that when we get
[23:50] into that specific time frame but let me
[23:52] go back for a second
[23:54] to the daily because i want to bring
[23:55] something up
[23:56] if you're
[23:58] using one screen
[23:59] okay
[24:00] you would obviously do this annotation
[24:02] here and then in this screen you would
[24:04] just simply change it to the hourly
[24:06] chart
[24:08] and then everything you did here
[24:10] would be transposed over to the trading
[24:13] view chart
[24:15] that would be on the hourly chart rather
[24:17] and then
[24:19] once you've done whatever breakdown and
[24:21] markups that you would have for your
[24:23] hourly chart
[24:25] then you would drop down to the 15
[24:27] minute timeframe and all of the
[24:28] annotations from the daily and the
[24:29] hourly would appear on your 15-minute
[24:31] chart as you'll see okay
[24:33] so let's go back to
[24:37] the layout
[24:39] and i'm going to maximize
[24:41] the hourly chart
[24:44] all right so i like to do these types of
[24:46] things bring it to the actual level i'm
[24:49] anchoring to
[24:50] because i have obsessive compulsive
[24:52] disorder so it is what it is
[24:55] it's a struggle folks so in here
[24:58] it's this imbalance on the daily chart
[25:01] but now we can see it also exists
[25:04] in the hourly as well so we have what
[25:08] this high
[25:09] and this high what are they
[25:12] they're relative equal highs
[25:14] anchored to
[25:16] that point right there okay
[25:18] so usually in my annotations i'm going
[25:20] into the chart
[25:23] and this is for the purposes of showing
[25:25] you how to back test and how you
[25:26] annotate your chart
[25:32] you toggle it
[25:33] to show on the top left
[25:36] and
[25:39] you can use whatever color you want
[25:45] and there you go
[25:47] so
[25:49] we had the annotations
[25:51] that would be on your chart for logging
[25:53] purposes for your study journal
[25:55] and then you would just screenshot this
[25:58] okay you might want to zoom in a little
[26:00] bit
[26:01] you know make the
[26:05] chart a little bit more aesthetically
[26:07] pleasing
[26:09] having something like that
[26:11] more you know more information zoomed in
[26:14] to a specific area
[26:16] and then simply go in and start working
[26:18] with
[26:19] the 15 minute time frame because this is
[26:21] all i would do
[26:23] with the hourly chart
[26:24] because the frame of reference is that
[26:26] daily fair value gap
[26:28] we have liquidity pull on the hourly
[26:30] chart we've already mapped out the
[26:33] 6th of april's low
[26:35] notice there's no lower low this low
[26:37] didn't go down to it and we start a new
[26:39] day on the seventh here at midnight new
[26:40] york local time
[26:42] what do i mean by new york midnight
[26:45] i'm going to answer that
[26:47] let's go to
[26:49] the 15 minute time frame here and as you
[26:52] can see we already have that little
[26:54] annotation
[26:55] updated on the 15 minute time frame so
[26:57] now here's the 15 minute timing frame
[27:00] and i apologize for all of you that
[27:02] would otherwise know how to do this but
[27:04] obviously it's a mentorship right
[27:06] there's a lot of people in the comments
[27:07] section that are asking for these types
[27:08] of lessons and once i go through this
[27:11] this episode we won't ever have to
[27:13] revisit it again okay so bear with me
[27:15] okay
[27:17] all right so now we have on the 15
[27:18] minute time frame
[27:20] we're going to annotate the daily
[27:22] dividers this all is a
[27:24] little vertical line okay and this
[27:26] little bar here is just my favorites bar
[27:29] and you can google that for setting that
[27:31] up these are the things i use most in
[27:33] trading view
[27:34] so when i expand the chart to maximize
[27:37] the full screen
[27:38] i highlight the little star button in
[27:41] the lower left hand corner
[27:43] just below the little link button if you
[27:44] click that link button any chart you
[27:46] have open that's the same symbol any all
[27:48] the annotations will be plotted and
[27:50] placed on all the time frames of that
[27:52] instrument or that pair or that market
[27:55] so in other words if like i was showing
[27:56] you with my trading layout upper
[27:58] left-hand corner daily hourly lower left
[28:01] hand and 15 minute time frame on the
[28:02] right it's the biggest chart
[28:04] hitting that little link button icon
[28:07] will
[28:07] again link all your charts together so
[28:09] whatever you're showing annotations on
[28:11] one time frame will appear on all of
[28:13] them that's how this is happening okay
[28:15] you can google that too and there's a
[28:16] lot of uh tips you can get off of
[28:20] youtube for a trading video most of my
[28:21] tips i actually got from my students
[28:23] which i appreciate because they're more
[28:24] fluent with this
[28:26] i came from mt4 and tradestation so
[28:30] i'm a work in progress with uh trading
[28:32] view
[28:33] so
[28:34] so you're gonna drop a vertical line
[28:36] here to delineate a new day at midnight
[28:40] what is the opening price at new york
[28:43] midnight
[28:45] that's this candle
[28:46] and you highlight that and this price
[28:49] right here
[28:51] that right there
[28:52] if you're looking at the time frame on
[28:54] the hourly that would be the opening
[28:56] price
[28:57] i'm interested in that
[28:59] on a 15 minute time frame
[29:03] or if i'm going to be scalping
[29:05] i'm going to use the five minute chart
[29:08] okay and i'll put two reference points
[29:10] on the five minute chart but for the
[29:12] sake of this discussion just know that
[29:14] that's the actual price i'm looking at
[29:17] and i'm drawing that out in time how far
[29:19] am i drawing it out 11 o'clock in the
[29:21] morning
[29:22] new york local time
[29:24] how do i know my charts gonna look like
[29:27] icts right that's what you're asking
[29:30] you toggle it to new york i don't care
[29:31] where you live
[29:33] i don't care where you're at in all the
[29:34] different time zones your trading view
[29:36] chart needs to be set to this
[29:38] if you do that your chart will match
[29:42] all the things i'm teaching
[29:43] and the things i'm teaching you to look
[29:44] for will be easier to find okay
[29:47] everything will be streamlined in terms
[29:49] of time of day
[29:51] all right so now we have the buy sell
[29:52] equity pull the daily denomination of
[29:55] midnight new york time
[29:57] and we're going to take a little
[30:02] line segment here
[30:04] and we're going to plot it right on here
[30:06] now i'm just going to just rough it
[30:07] because it's basically a little tiny
[30:09] indecisive candle i don't care the
[30:10] difference between the actual open and
[30:12] close it's very minute
[30:14] but i'm going to draw that on here and
[30:15] if you drag your
[30:17] your trend line over to the right if you
[30:20] hold down the shift button it'll keep
[30:22] your trend line straight
[30:24] okay just drop it there
[30:26] and i'll just make this
[30:29] a gray color here
[30:30] now you can annotate that but over time
[30:33] doing it you'll just know that that's
[30:34] what you're anchoring and showing this
[30:35] is the opening price at midnight okay
[30:39] now
[30:40] we have the relative equal highs here
[30:43] we rallied above them once it hits this
[30:46] do we get displacement
[30:49] now we get down to the nitty gritty okay
[30:52] we have a swing low here
[30:54] it breaks down below that and then once
[30:57] it does that does it create an imbalance
[31:00] is there a fair value gap
[31:03] hint nudge nudge
[31:06] you see that all right so we're going to
[31:08] annotate that
[31:10] so inside of this range
[31:12] here
[31:14] we have
[31:16] a fair value gap and i'm gonna highlight
[31:18] this we'll just use this color here now
[31:19] these are probably not the best colors
[31:21] you're probably
[31:22] cussing me right now saying why are you
[31:24] using these ugly colors ict that's
[31:26] something just to annoy you so that way
[31:28] you can get more attentive
[31:30] and pay attention because this is a long
[31:32] video already so
[31:34] we're looking at the
[31:36] market wanting to go higher first to go
[31:39] lower
[31:40] and here's that midnight delineation
[31:42] starting a new day
[31:44] we rally up
[31:45] and then we break down
[31:47] so what's the model teach
[31:49] trading when
[31:51] the new york session
[31:53] okay
[31:54] so we're trading the new york session
[31:57] in 4x it's seven o'clock in the morning
[32:00] to ten o'clock in the morning
[32:02] right there okay
[32:04] so ten o'clock in the morning
[32:06] and seven o'clock
[32:08] so we're looking for a setup that would
[32:10] be formed
[32:12] within that time frame
[32:15] now you can create killzone windows
[32:19] annotations on your chart
[32:24] there's lots of ways i've done this over
[32:26] the years you can do it whatever way you
[32:27] want to do it
[32:32] inside center
[32:34] and we'll make it
[32:36] black
[32:38] and
[32:38] [Music]
[32:41] there you go
[32:43] so the new york kill zone it runs up
[32:45] into that runs the highs
[32:47] and we want to see a displacement to the
[32:48] downside we get it right there
[32:51] okay
[32:52] so now you have this area here
[32:55] and then you would put your order in
[32:57] right there what time is that
[32:59] it's 10 o'clock
[33:00] so you put your limit order in to sell
[33:03] short right at that price right there or
[33:05] plus one pip
[33:07] period
[33:08] and your risk is going to be
[33:11] above this high the imbalance is really
[33:13] stretched out you can use that
[33:15] as your stop
[33:17] if you're really concerned you can put
[33:19] your stop above the swing high but
[33:21] whenever you have a big range like that
[33:23] my stop
[33:24] can place right there
[33:26] so your stop would be here
[33:28] and you're going to go short here
[33:30] that's the minimum expectation using the
[33:32] 15 minute timing frame but we're going
[33:34] to split
[33:36] the 15 minute time frame down into
[33:39] five-minute intervals
[33:41] okay so we're gonna look inside this
[33:43] range here and see if it's advantageous
[33:45] for us to go down into a five-minute
[33:47] chart and does it have a fair value gap
[33:50] in that all right so we're looking at
[33:51] the five-minute chart now and it's that
[33:53] shaded area here so it's using this
[33:56] specific candle or that low
[33:59] and we're looking inside this range
[34:00] right here
[34:02] okay so it's this decline we're looking
[34:05] at does it have
[34:06] fair value gap
[34:09] well
[34:10] we have this small one right in here
[34:13] see that we have this stretched out one
[34:15] here yes
[34:17] and then we have all this running here
[34:18] where it has a small little fair value
[34:20] got
[34:20] so now think about what's been shown on
[34:23] that 15 minute time frame we have a
[34:24] minimum threshold of at least reaching
[34:26] into this low
[34:29] okay remember i showed you on the 50
[34:31] minute timeframe that inbounds so it
[34:33] needs to get up into that
[34:35] okay so i'm answering the question that
[34:37] i saw or it really wasn't a question it
[34:39] was someone trying to make a point that
[34:42] was i showing something incorrectly
[34:45] by showing a higher time frame fair
[34:47] value gap because wouldn't the smaller
[34:49] time frame fair value got formed before
[34:51] the higher timing frame no it never
[34:53] works like that
[34:54] the higher time frame imbalances are
[34:56] going to be parent
[34:58] to
[35:00] the subordinate smaller time frames okay
[35:02] the parent
[35:04] okay is this 15 minute time frame
[35:07] imbalance
[35:08] so it needs to get above that
[35:11] but when it does that we have to look at
[35:14] the lower time frame below 15 minute
[35:16] time frame which is the beginning stages
[35:18] of our fine-tuned entry of five four
[35:20] three two and one time frames
[35:23] so here we have the five-minute chart
[35:26] we have an imbalance right here
[35:28] and then we have that smaller one right
[35:29] in here
[35:31] and all the way up to this price point
[35:32] here
[35:33] we could factor that in but it's not
[35:35] likely to get up there
[35:37] so we can look at what
[35:39] this
[35:40] level here
[35:41] that is the minimum expectation you can
[35:44] put a
[35:45] cell limit order there to go short or
[35:47] you can fine-tune this
[35:49] to rebalance all up to here
[35:54] right there in other words it would look
[35:56] like this
[35:57] this would be your imbalance on the
[35:58] five-minute chart
[36:00] and if it traded up into that
[36:02] right there
[36:04] okay you know what you could use
[36:06] any tank any
[36:08] specific price
[36:11] in this range here you can pick
[36:14] this is where the unique style for you
[36:16] comes in
[36:17] if you get greedy
[36:19] you may not get your fill
[36:21] so i'm teaching you the low threshold
[36:23] entry but that always will give you the
[36:25] highest risk
[36:27] but that higher risk in terms of number
[36:30] of pips not in terms of the amount of
[36:32] money because that part is always
[36:34] controlled by you the trader you can
[36:36] manage the amount of leverage you're
[36:37] using and it doesn't matter how many
[36:39] pips of risk you have
[36:41] the amount of allocation in terms of the
[36:43] leverage that you're using in the trade
[36:45] that's the most important thing and
[36:46] that's the most important thing that
[36:48] gets abused most of the time by traders
[36:51] because
[36:52] every time a trader gets in the
[36:54] marketplace
[36:56] their expectations are
[36:57] how can i make the most and they don't
[37:00] necessarily think about the other side
[37:01] of that sword because
[37:04] if the edge you're trying to chop with
[37:06] okay or swing
[37:08] if it makes contact with with your
[37:10] target then yes you are profitable but
[37:12] if it comes back and hits you in the
[37:13] head okay you're burying that axe right
[37:16] in your skull so that leverage is going
[37:19] to be
[37:20] counterproductive to you it's going to
[37:21] hurt you at that point it's not going to
[37:23] be
[37:23] beneficial to you it's going to harm you
[37:26] so
[37:27] i'm teaching you the low threshold entry
[37:30] but i'm also teaching you in addition to
[37:32] that i'm showing you how to build an
[37:34] additional perspective that helps you
[37:36] find
[37:37] the better entries that allows you to
[37:39] shorten the number of pips or points if
[37:42] you're trading with the index futures
[37:44] okay but long story short this would be
[37:46] your range you can work within and
[37:48] it trades up into
[37:50] that secondary fair value gap now some
[37:52] of you might say well what happens if i
[37:53] put a limit up here well that would be
[37:56] obviously a stellar entry but you don't
[37:58] necessarily need that okay
[38:01] why i like this one
[38:03] is because if you look at the 15 minute
[38:05] time frame
[38:07] it was like this
[38:09] that was the range okay so if we go up
[38:12] in that range to
[38:14] the upper end of it look over here what
[38:16] do we have all three of these candles
[38:18] here
[38:19] one two three
[38:21] the order block begins
[38:24] with this candle's low
[38:26] it's one two three candles making one
[38:28] consecutive
[38:30] bearish order block
[38:32] some of you
[38:34] are commenting in the section of the
[38:36] video saying
[38:37] i thought i understood order blocks now
[38:39] i'm confused because you're hearing
[38:41] people
[38:42] parrot
[38:43] what i've said in certain circumstances
[38:46] and they don't understand what an order
[38:48] block is okay
[38:50] this is why
[38:51] i get upset when people try to teach
[38:54] what they heard me teach about one or
[38:56] two times
[38:57] and the buzzword is what's being tossed
[38:59] around so that way people can sell their
[39:01] courses and get clicks on their videos
[39:04] you have no idea
[39:06] learning about order blocks from anybody
[39:08] else on youtube i'm gonna make it very
[39:10] plain and make a blanket statement right
[39:11] there i'm not trying to hurt anybody's
[39:12] feelings i know a lot of you out there
[39:13] that
[39:14] try to talk about order blocks
[39:16] you have a lot of respect for me
[39:18] but i'm trying to correct you because i
[39:21] know you have a large audience and some
[39:23] of you have a very large audience and
[39:25] you're doing things that are not
[39:28] accurate
[39:29] okay
[39:30] so
[39:31] i know you're watching my videos that
[39:33] way you'll correct what you're doing so
[39:35] that way your viewers won't be harmed or
[39:38] they won't use something that's done
[39:40] incorrectly and dubbed as my order block
[39:43] and if they have
[39:45] hardship or difficulty doing it it's
[39:50] not going to be a tribute to the
[39:51] concepts
[39:52] being affected because they are
[39:54] effective it's just
[39:56] they haven't been taught properly okay
[39:59] it's easy to talk about in hindsight but
[40:00] it's real hard to do it in real time
[40:02] unless you know what you're doing
[40:04] so the logic is we we ran up into this
[40:07] daily fair value gap that's what this
[40:09] level is up here this red line was does
[40:11] relative equal highs on the hourly chart
[40:13] remember that
[40:15] and
[40:16] you're probably going to need to watch
[40:17] this video a few times because i've gone
[40:18] through a lot already
[40:20] but i'm breaking down the market
[40:22] and this run here is the run into that
[40:25] imbalance and above the relative equal
[40:27] highs so this
[40:29] is the
[40:31] bearish order block it's the consecutive
[40:33] run on this time frame the five minute
[40:35] chart
[40:37] it does not need to get up into this
[40:39] last up closed candle before the down
[40:40] close because that's what everybody says
[40:42] in order block is it is not that
[40:45] notice it doesn't even get up to that
[40:47] does it
[40:48] why
[40:49] because what i'm showing you here what
[40:51] makes an order block
[40:53] valid
[40:55] it has to have an imbalance
[40:58] without the imbalance
[41:01] there is no order block
[41:03] that's why it's not supply and demand
[41:05] okay there are specific rules i'm going
[41:07] to cut through candles supply and demand
[41:10] requires fresh zones okay that's
[41:12] nonsense i have no
[41:14] affinity for anything like that i'll cut
[41:16] through fractals and go through and find
[41:18] something over here and still trade on
[41:21] it
[41:22] so it violates the supply and demand
[41:24] theory right there so i that's the
[41:26] distinction and why i laugh at people
[41:27] that say oh he's teaching really nothing
[41:30] new i'm really teaching you something
[41:31] that no one's talking about
[41:33] unless i talk about it first they're
[41:35] saying what i said
[41:37] and not to sound egotistical i'm not
[41:38] trying to be egotistical but i i want
[41:40] you to learn it correctly folks okay
[41:43] i only want to see you do it the right
[41:46] way
[41:46] because if you do it the right way you
[41:48] will find the results you're looking for
[41:50] if you don't want to do what i'm
[41:51] teaching you're not going to be
[41:52] consistent you're not going to find
[41:54] longevity and you're going to get
[41:55] frustrated and you're going to think
[41:56] that this stuff doesn't work because you
[41:58] didn't learn it properly from the person
[41:59] that created it
[42:01] the order block is all three consecutive
[42:04] candles the reason why this last up
[42:06] close candle is not even traded to is
[42:08] because the higher time frame parent
[42:10] imbalance that 15 minute time frame
[42:13] which is being shown here
[42:15] that range of that low and that candle
[42:17] is high here
[42:18] it stops there
[42:20] so there's no necessity for it to trade
[42:22] up into that last candle
[42:24] so if it trades up into
[42:27] this candle here the bottom one
[42:30] the last one of the three going up
[42:33] that's enough for me and take that over
[42:35] here and then we have this inbound so in
[42:37] my mind
[42:38] this imbalance is sufficient
[42:41] we don't need this one
[42:43] and you wouldn't expect that last up
[42:44] close cam to be traded too
[42:46] so
[42:47] this is the ideal scenario that i think
[42:50] the mentorship on youtube should be
[42:52] looking for now as soon as you have this
[42:54] this is one you settle in on what are
[42:56] you met with another little fair value
[42:59] got right above it so what were the
[43:01] rules that i gave you when it has that
[43:03] in the chart
[43:04] think
[43:05] it is going to be
[43:07] a likelihood that it could trade up in
[43:09] there but your limit order to enter is
[43:11] down in here because it might not get up
[43:13] here what am i trying to do i'm trying
[43:15] to teach you how to avoid missing trades
[43:18] because a lot of you're going to want to
[43:19] put an order up in here and yes it would
[43:20] have been filled on this instance but
[43:22] many times you're going to have an order
[43:25] placed at a really overzealous price
[43:28] point that if you nail it it's beautiful
[43:31] but they don't happen a lot
[43:33] it's fleeting it happens once in a while
[43:36] so i'm trying to give you something that
[43:38] allows you to operate consistently gives
[43:40] you lots of setups that will allow you
[43:42] to practice also back test like i'm
[43:44] showing you here this is how you back
[43:45] test because this has already happened
[43:47] but these are all the things that i'm
[43:49] teaching in this mentorship and i've
[43:50] talked about this level here in my own
[43:52] private group beforehand and you also
[43:54] knew about the bias being bearish on
[43:56] this pair from tuesday's trading
[43:58] or tuesday's episode in this mentorship
[44:00] on the youtube channel okay
[44:02] so we have a break in
[44:05] this low here
[44:06] so there's an internal shift in market
[44:08] structure it's bearish we have the
[44:10] imbalance here that's been refined down
[44:12] into the five-minute chart in concert
[44:14] with the bearish order block the lowest
[44:16] down closed candle we've talked about
[44:19] why we're not looking at the last closed
[44:21] candle before the down move so we're
[44:22] cancelling all that misconception
[44:25] and it runs up into the level with the
[44:27] rule i gave you if we settle in on a
[44:29] fair value gap and it has a small one
[44:30] above it expected it might trade up
[44:32] there so your risk has to incorporate
[44:34] that
[44:35] so that's the reason why i'm telling you
[44:37] your stop-loss could be here
[44:40] yes it might be a little bit too rich
[44:42] for some of you because you want to
[44:43] trade with
[44:44] one pip stop loss a half a pip stop loss
[44:47] there's a lot of guys out there trying
[44:48] to do ultra ultra short term stuff you
[44:51] might be able to pull it off once in a
[44:52] while maybe you know a series of trades
[44:54] but i promise you when you start putting
[44:56] down size on these trades
[44:58] you're not going to pull that off okay
[45:00] it just isn't going to happen so don't
[45:02] get used to trying to do it okay
[45:04] plus it's easy to do other things you
[45:07] can walk away from the charts and not be
[45:09] chained to it because
[45:11] if you have a small ultra short stop
[45:14] i don't care how good you are
[45:16] you're gonna sweat it you're gonna be
[45:18] expecting you're gonna get stopped out
[45:19] what happens if it stops me out
[45:21] i'm not worrying about getting stopped
[45:22] out i'm not worried about if the market
[45:24] moves to my stop i'm more interested in
[45:27] the market moving where i think it's
[45:28] going to go where is that that's this
[45:30] level down here that's the sixth of
[45:33] april's low
[45:34] okay yeah we went lower than that
[45:36] already here let me get this thing out
[45:38] of your way
[45:39] if you take this and move out of the way
[45:41] here we have the an early run at uh five
[45:44] o'clock or so in the morning it made
[45:45] that at 5 25 new york local time in the
[45:48] morning it swept the previous days low
[45:52] so the 6th of april was swept then we
[45:54] rallied up and we hit the level that
[45:56] what our bias
[45:58] called for in other words i'm looking
[46:00] for this level to be traded to before i
[46:02] go short so i'm not taking anything in
[46:05] london i'm not worried about anything in
[46:06] london because london didn't give me the
[46:07] initial rally higher into this area when
[46:10] does it go up here
[46:12] it's going up there at 9 30 in the
[46:13] morning new york local time
[46:15] so it hits that level it's at a really
[46:17] rich premium
[46:19] and i know my discount level i'm looking
[46:21] for for targeting so here's the
[46:23] framework the setup we have our market
[46:25] structure shift
[46:27] disqualified all these upper
[46:30] candles here the lower candle that's
[46:32] where you're going to aim for
[46:34] what's the order block that you trade
[46:35] for michael what's the one what's the
[46:37] right order block how do i pick the
[46:38] right order block i just answered it
[46:43] what is an order block it's a change in
[46:45] the state of delivery the algorithm
[46:47] changes its state of delivery as soon as
[46:49] we get below
[46:51] this candle's
[46:52] open
[46:53] the market starts delivering sell side
[46:56] and then it breaks this swing low so now
[46:58] we have changed gears internally any
[47:01] rally after that is just setting up
[47:02] another run to go lower so in other
[47:05] words this is a suspect rally
[47:07] okay so this is an intermediate term
[47:10] high
[47:11] swing high because it has the imbalance
[47:13] it should not trade higher than that
[47:15] high that's the reason why i'm telling
[47:16] you you can put your stop loss there
[47:18] see how the rules are coming together
[47:20] i'm not complicating it i'm literally
[47:22] telling you everything i've taught and
[47:25] i'm putting it into the chart
[47:27] everything
[47:28] was said before it happened and here it
[47:30] is it's the framework it's the logic and
[47:33] i'm teaching you with the great detail
[47:35] that you otherwise would have never
[47:37] learned so i'm taking you in over top
[47:40] the chart giving you the framework and
[47:41] giving you the logic i'm giving you the
[47:43] what if this what if that conditions
[47:47] okay i'm telling you how to negate
[47:48] certain order blocks that you would
[47:50] otherwise expect to see it trade to
[47:52] because of different youtube channels or
[47:54] other people trying to teach my stuff
[47:55] and they don't know what they're talking
[47:56] about okay they have no idea what
[47:58] they're doing
[48:00] this setup here gives us a nice
[48:02] opportunity to get short so you could be
[48:04] a seller here on a limit entry so you
[48:06] place your limit order here and you just
[48:08] walk away from it you let it go
[48:10] now what happens if it doesn't fill you
[48:12] by 11 30 pull the order
[48:16] that's it don't put it you know good
[48:17] till cancel just pull it because you
[48:20] want to be entering on the day that it
[48:22] creates this because relative equal
[48:24] highs if it doesn't drop off
[48:27] it could come up in a time of day where
[48:29] you won't really want to be there and it
[48:31] could fill you
[48:33] and then keep on running and take out
[48:34] the relative equal highs at a deeper
[48:36] pass and then stop you out so it's
[48:38] important to know why the kill zones are
[48:40] there kill zones are when you determine
[48:43] your entry and you place your orders and
[48:44] you walk away
[48:46] you don't need to have your entry filled
[48:50] inside that kill zone window
[48:52] your order idea and your order placement
[48:56] needs to be considered at that time if
[48:58] you can't derive a order placement for
[49:01] setup or trade entry by that time you
[49:04] have nothing to do
[49:05] and that's it you've basically
[49:08] taken no risk on and you have to wait to
[49:10] the next trading opportunity or trading
[49:11] day
[49:13] and the market obviously starts to break
[49:15] lower
[49:16] and then
[49:20] trades to it here
[49:21] at
[49:23] 245.
[49:25] so at 245
[49:27] it fills it
[49:28] and that's the end of that so
[49:31] not bad it's
[49:33] 10 20 30
[49:35] 40 pips
[49:37] so there you go 40 pips
[49:39] you don't get the very highest high
[49:42] and it ultimately goes a little bit
[49:44] lower who cares
[49:46] you you've structured a trade that makes
[49:49] sense
[49:51] and
[49:52] it's just a really nice
[49:53] run up in there
[49:55] and everything's delivered on the basis
[49:57] of the logic and the elements i'm
[49:59] teaching you in this youtube channel
[50:02] and you can't argue with it it's
[50:04] it's obvious it's so plain to see how
[50:07] these markets are being delivered
[50:09] and if you're one that likes to argue
[50:11] and say there is an algorithm or if you
[50:13] say that these concepts don't work and
[50:14] all that stuff it's because you want
[50:16] some excuse why you can't do it yourself
[50:19] and i don't want any of you to feel that
[50:21] way okay i don't get a high or
[50:24] you know
[50:25] get my rocks off because
[50:27] people
[50:28] stumble
[50:29] and not do well with this because i know
[50:32] why they're not doing well
[50:34] you're not doing the work that's
[50:36] required that means going through your
[50:38] charts and doing what i just did here
[50:40] every
[50:41] single day
[50:44] and
[50:45] being passionate about it
[50:46] looking at what it is that has been
[50:49] shown in price action what is it doing
[50:51] what is it not doing
[50:53] the things i've taught you in this
[50:54] lesson tonight is
[50:56] in my mind it's
[50:58] charter level
[51:00] teaching
[51:01] it literally is something that i would
[51:03] generally reserve for charter members
[51:06] only that means the people that have
[51:07] been with me for
[51:09] a year or more
[51:10] and they're under my tutelage in my
[51:12] private community so this is a lesson
[51:15] that literally
[51:17] would come from that type of
[51:21] student level
[51:23] but i'm applying it to what you're
[51:25] learning with this model
[51:27] it's applicable
[51:29] to forex it's applicable to
[51:32] bonds it's applicable to
[51:35] gold it's applicable but let me put this
[51:37] because i see a lot of people also
[51:38] saying can you show it in gold
[51:41] gold is
[51:42] one of those markets that is an event
[51:45] driven market
[51:47] okay and what that means is
[51:49] it usually requires some kind of
[51:52] geopolitical or
[51:56] something crazy
[51:57] causing it to move
[51:59] otherwise it's highly manipulated
[52:01] there's a lot of stop hunts and then
[52:04] consolidations it's very frustrating
[52:06] okay it's it's not a it's not a market i
[52:08] believe
[52:09] that
[52:10] someone should be aggressively
[52:12] short-term trading i don't think that's
[52:13] the ideal market there's plenty other
[52:15] markets out there that you can do that
[52:16] with
[52:17] and have better
[52:18] you know consistency and longevity now
[52:21] am i saying there aren't
[52:23] people out there that are making money
[52:24] consistently in gold no i'm not saying
[52:26] that i'm saying because i'm speaking to
[52:29] people with the expectation that you're
[52:30] just now learning how to do this i'm
[52:32] aware that there's a lot of you that are
[52:34] veterans that have been trading longer
[52:37] than the average person coming to my
[52:38] youtube channel
[52:39] but i have to speak in a language that
[52:41] is palatable
[52:43] for a new viewer
[52:45] otherwise i'm gonna speak to and this
[52:47] might be too lofty for a new viewer
[52:49] anyway but it hopefully it will intrigue
[52:51] them to see that there's a rhyming
[52:53] reason to everything i'm teaching and
[52:54] they repeat
[52:55] it keeps happening every single day
[52:58] these signatures repeat so
[53:00] the question is going to be is
[53:04] what are you
[53:05] going to do with this information are
[53:07] you going to just say okay well this is
[53:08] great but this is too much work so i'm
[53:10] going to look for something else that
[53:12] gives me a moving average crossover
[53:14] or some kind of a bell and whistle to
[53:16] put things on my chart to tell me what
[53:17] to do and then you're basically creating
[53:19] a religious trading style because you're
[53:22] trusting something other than price
[53:24] because
[53:25] what have i shown you here just price
[53:29] there's no indicators here i'm only
[53:31] putting these areas in here with this
[53:33] rectangle to highlight an imbalance
[53:36] i don't have these on my chart in time
[53:38] you won't either but in the beginning
[53:40] while you're learning it's important to
[53:41] annotate your chart so that when you log
[53:43] them in your study journal that way at
[53:45] the end of the week you go back and look
[53:46] at all the intraday price action then
[53:48] you look at how the weekly chart worked
[53:50] within that whole
[53:52] panoramic view
[53:54] of intraday daily price action how did
[53:56] it all fit together and by doing that
[53:59] you're literally getting snapshots of
[54:01] every individual day
[54:03] then the daily chart in the weekly chart
[54:05] and how it fulfilled its entire
[54:07] weekly range
[54:09] when was the high for when was the low
[54:10] formed what was the biggest day of the
[54:12] week what was the framework around that
[54:15] biggest day of the week of movement
[54:17] and then also breakdown obviously like
[54:19] we're showing you here where trade
[54:21] setups it doesn't make a difference if
[54:23] you didn't trade it
[54:24] everything anybody ever learns is always
[54:27] done by hindsight you want to be a
[54:29] doctor a surgeon guess what you're doing
[54:31] you're working in hindsight you're
[54:32] studying medical journals that about
[54:34] things that took place that you were not
[54:36] there okay you're studying hindsight
[54:38] don't let these
[54:40] goobers out there try to discourage you
[54:43] from studying because i'm teaching you
[54:45] how you are going to get better at this
[54:47] you do what i just showed you how to do
[54:49] right here
[54:50] and you do it every single day
[54:52] you're going to develop your own style
[54:54] of keeping notes in your charts i'm not
[54:55] going to do that here because
[54:57] i don't want to make a
[55:00] an example and feel like you have to
[55:04] do exactly what i said okay
[55:06] what do i mean by that
[55:09] it's
[55:10] to me it's fascinating to see people
[55:11] comment in the comment section of the
[55:13] videos or they'll send me an email
[55:15] or i'll listen to people that obviously
[55:17] are trained under me and they make
[55:19] videos on youtube
[55:20] i can hear my fingerprints or read my
[55:23] fingerprints in the way they talk
[55:25] they'll say certain things
[55:28] certain words certain
[55:30] expressions
[55:32] i can i can see my own fingerprints on
[55:34] that
[55:35] this part
[55:36] i always leave
[55:38] empty and i do the same
[55:40] way
[55:41] of teaching even in a private group
[55:44] because i never show them annotations
[55:46] outside of the things i'm showing
[55:47] because
[55:48] over here you might write an observation
[55:51] about something that you may want to
[55:53] further investigate
[55:55] that i might not even touch on in this
[55:57] discussion or lecture
[55:59] but it's important to you so you use the
[56:02] space in your chart to write those
[56:03] things down and then you come back to
[56:05] that chart on saturday at the end of the
[56:07] week or sunday if that's the day you're
[56:08] going to do it on
[56:10] and you revisit the entire week and you
[56:12] walk through the entire week of how it
[56:14] delivered how many pips did it move and
[56:16] how much risk would have been incurred
[56:19] in the trade
[56:20] so all those things work towards
[56:23] a
[56:24] model
[56:25] that you'll grow accustomed to trusting
[56:27] because you'll have
[56:28] back data
[56:30] and you'll have examples that you've
[56:32] trained yourself to see over time
[56:35] and by doing this your psychological
[56:37] makeup as a trader will be formed
[56:40] with these things in mind so that way
[56:43] when you're watching price action it'll
[56:45] leap off at the chart when it's forming
[56:48] and you'll remember something you saw
[56:50] hundreds or thousands of times before
[56:52] that generally repeat over and over and
[56:54] over again does every single day look
[56:57] exactly like this no
[56:59] but there's a lot of similarity to the
[57:00] things i'm showing you here that repeat
[57:03] so it's it's a matter of knowing what
[57:06] you're looking for if two
[57:09] bears
[57:10] are walking in the snow one's younger
[57:13] and one's older and they're walking in
[57:15] the snow will both footprints look
[57:17] exactly the same no
[57:20] but you'll recognize they're both bear
[57:21] prints and you'll recognize which one's
[57:23] larger or older and which one's younger
[57:27] so that's what it's like when you're
[57:29] looking at these signatures and price
[57:30] action
[57:31] they are
[57:32] generally
[57:34] very close to one another in terms of
[57:36] repeating the same type of way
[57:39] but they're not going to be so identical
[57:41] that they're indistinguishable to
[57:44] the next one like
[57:45] you'll be able to see that that's a
[57:46] different day of trading
[57:48] but you'll still recognize these
[57:50] repeating phenomenon that is so telling
[57:52] in the marketplace but you can't fully
[57:54] appreciate it right now because you're
[57:56] only now just becoming introduced to it
[57:58] and maybe you've watched some of my
[57:59] videos maybe you watched all my videos
[58:02] and you see when i do this and it
[58:04] resonates with you you're like man i can
[58:06] i get it because he's showing it to me
[58:08] but then you go out into the chart and
[58:10] you try to do it and it just feels like
[58:11] your chart doesn't is
[58:13] organized or it's not so obvious to you
[58:16] what you're looking for that's normal
[58:19] that's how it was for me for a long time
[58:21] in the 90s for a long time i struggled
[58:24] and floundered of trying to figure out
[58:27] what i'm supposed to be looking for
[58:29] i'm teaching you the things that repeat
[58:32] your job is to keep going into the chart
[58:34] annotating them and keeping a a running
[58:36] log a study journal of what the price
[58:39] action has done and what you're
[58:40] observing
[58:42] you can't get hurt because it's already
[58:43] happened the moves already happened so
[58:46] you're studying it so what you're
[58:47] creating is the greatest technical
[58:50] analysis book that you're ever going to
[58:52] own and you're doing it in your own
[58:54] words
[58:55] with your own work
[58:57] because when you buy a book what are you
[58:58] getting you're getting snapshots of
[58:59] something they're saying this is the
[59:01] important thing about this particular
[59:03] chapter or the theme of this particular
[59:05] book
[59:06] i'm showing you how you need to stop
[59:08] buying books
[59:09] there is no books out there except for
[59:11] the ones i put in that one video that's
[59:13] in my library
[59:14] honestly that's it no other books are
[59:17] necessary
[59:18] in trading in my opinion it's just it's
[59:21] the same garbage that's repeated and
[59:23] rehashed and people are just trying to
[59:24] do a cash grab
[59:26] you're not going to learn anything
[59:27] except for bad habits and
[59:29] flawed logic
[59:30] now
[59:32] when you've created a study journal with
[59:35] thousands of examples and you've been
[59:37] doing it for years
[59:39] you're going to be astonished
[59:41] of how much of a
[59:45] technical analyst you are years from now
[59:48] and you'll be able to see a lot more
[59:50] setups that you just don't see like
[59:52] there's several opportunities in this
[59:54] time frame or this fractal here on a
[59:57] five-minute chart there's lots of little
[59:58] trades in here i'm not going to go
[60:00] through and pick them all out because
[60:01] this is going to create a thousand
[60:02] different questions and you're going to
[60:04] miss
[60:05] or overlook the very thing i've shown
[60:07] you in this lecture
[60:09] but this is a model
[60:11] that obviously works in this time frame
[60:14] in this pair it's in 4x it's not highly
[60:18] specific only two futures
[60:22] notice that it's
[60:25] pretty clear isn't it
[60:26] it may not have been clear
[60:28] before i walked through it with you
[60:32] but you learned hopefully a great deal
[60:34] of things tonight you learned a little
[60:36] bit about quarter blocks what makes an
[60:37] order block based on the fair value gap
[60:40] how do you differentiate
[60:42] how you
[60:43] look at the order block how do you break
[60:45] it down how do you invalidate the
[60:47] certain parts of the order block how do
[60:49] you know it's not going to go in the
[60:50] upper half of the order block or the
[60:52] last up closed candle before it goes
[60:54] down i taught that tonight
[60:57] so
[60:58] hopefully this has been insightful to
[60:59] you and obviously we'll be back again
[61:02] next tuesday until i talk to you then
[61:04] enjoy your weekend and be safe
