[00:02] all right folks welcome back this is
[00:04] episode six in our ongoing ict
[00:06] mentorship on youtube for 2022
[00:10] and the market efficiency paradigm and
[00:12] institutional order flow will be our
[00:14] topic for this evening
[00:19] all right so how do we internalize price
[00:21] delivery
[00:24] first we do not trade patterns for
[00:26] patterns sake
[00:28] we do not trade indicator readings or
[00:30] momentum
[00:33] we look to enter longs where retail
[00:35] sells
[00:37] we look to enter shorts where retail
[00:39] buys usually when you hear
[00:41] me say something like that or someone
[00:42] that's been trained by me speak like
[00:44] that it sounds like well you know
[00:46] you're talking like you work for an
[00:48] institution you work at a bank you know
[00:50] you're you're trading retail too yes
[00:52] we are all operating
[00:55] through retail avenues to get to the
[00:57] marketplace
[00:59] what i'm teaching you is the internal
[01:01] dialogue
[01:03] of what we're doing we're looking at
[01:04] price
[01:06] we're not thinking
[01:07] like the collective that is commonly
[01:09] referred to as the retail trader because
[01:12] majority of retail traders lose
[01:15] they have a failed logic they don't have
[01:17] consistency they don't have
[01:19] well longevity
[01:21] so we want to try to think
[01:24] and engage differently with price
[01:28] that is opposed to the majority of what
[01:30] retail
[01:32] analysis concepts
[01:34] you whatever it is that you
[01:36] subscribe to as a retail trader
[01:40] you know all those things
[01:41] unless they're rooted in the basis of
[01:43] liquidity and overflow
[01:45] it's
[01:46] made up it's a religion and
[01:49] i'm not here to argue beyond that that's
[01:52] what i have come to to believe
[01:55] and that's how i operate and my results
[01:58] and the things that my students see
[02:01] speak for themselves
[02:04] we anticipate price seeking opposing
[02:07] liquidity
[02:08] okay so what does that mean
[02:10] well if you're looking at this diagram
[02:12] imagine
[02:14] if we could
[02:15] take
[02:17] price as a
[02:19] conceptual idea it doesn't matter what
[02:21] market it is but let's just say there's
[02:24] two camps
[02:26] there's the informed or smart money and
[02:28] that's represented by this small little
[02:30] circle over here
[02:32] and then there's a larger collective
[02:34] which is the speculative uninformed
[02:36] money there's a large influx all the
[02:39] time of new
[02:40] uninformed money coming in because
[02:42] there's a large influx of uninformed
[02:44] money going out because they lose their
[02:46] account they blow
[02:48] up whatever equity they have in your
[02:50] trading account it's gone because of
[02:52] lack of discipline and a flawed logic
[02:57] smart money traders when they look at
[02:59] the marketplace
[03:00] they're not looking at secret trading
[03:03] indicators
[03:04] okay
[03:06] there is no
[03:07] secret indicators
[03:10] just let me put that
[03:11] to bed right now now there may be
[03:14] traders that have tools
[03:16] okay that they like to measure price
[03:18] action with
[03:20] that's not like a stochastics
[03:23] it's not like an rsi it's not like a
[03:29] well anything you can find on a trading
[03:31] platform list of indicators okay
[03:33] those things are not reached for
[03:37] by informed money
[03:38] what they're specifically looking at is
[03:41] time and price
[03:43] the most important thing is time
[03:46] because time
[03:48] that is
[03:49] the most crucial element so time of day
[03:52] is vital when we're engaging price
[03:54] retail doesn't really have
[03:57] any understanding
[03:58] or affinity for time except for the fact
[04:02] that they have time now to trade because
[04:04] they're in front of their computer or
[04:05] they have time to look at their phone
[04:06] while they're at work and they're
[04:07] putting on trades okay that's the extent
[04:10] of time when it comes to a retail
[04:12] average trader
[04:15] time
[04:16] for a professional through the lens of
[04:18] smart money
[04:19] time is crucial because time
[04:22] of day there are specific elements
[04:24] in a daily range
[04:25] that
[04:26] really build the
[04:28] likelihood of volatility to come in and
[04:31] also
[04:32] when short-term reversals are likely to
[04:34] occur
[04:35] okay so
[04:36] i mentioned in previous lessons that
[04:39] there's algorithms
[04:40] that will start to gyrate
[04:43] and cause price to run at specific times
[04:46] of the day
[04:47] if you were watching the
[04:48] e-mini markets today you saw it happen
[04:50] at four o'clock
[04:52] that was one of the times i gave and it
[04:53] was relentless today
[04:57] smart money so that way i can make this
[04:59] real short and to the point
[05:00] smart money looks
[05:02] to
[05:03] cannibalize
[05:05] this group of trader
[05:08] so because they're typically wrong
[05:12] in their directional bias in their
[05:14] stop placement should they choose to use
[05:16] one because a lot of traders don't use a
[05:19] stop loss as a retail trader because
[05:20] they're afraid
[05:22] they may expect the market to go lower
[05:24] and they understand that the
[05:26] highs above where they're at if they're
[05:28] in a very small window of profitability
[05:31] unrealized profit means they're still in
[05:32] the trade but they don't have a stop
[05:34] loss in
[05:35] now logic dictates that they should have
[05:37] a
[05:38] buy stop in to protect their position in
[05:41] case the market screams against them at
[05:42] least it limits the amount of equity
[05:45] lost but
[05:47] they may look at an old high and say
[05:49] okay i understand that my stop should be
[05:50] above that but because of their infancy
[05:54] they have no idea where to put it above
[05:56] that high they don't want to put it too
[05:58] shallow because it might go up and hit
[06:00] it and stop out their trade prematurely
[06:02] and or
[06:03] they don't want to put it up too high
[06:06] and then it spikes through that reaches
[06:08] for them
[06:09] and then it reverses and goes in the
[06:10] direction they're holding so they take a
[06:12] big loss and get stopped out so those
[06:14] are the two
[06:16] conundrums that a retail trader falls in
[06:20] to that pitfall that trap
[06:23] and maybe you're nodding your head and
[06:24] smirking thinking man i was there a lot
[06:27] i know and i can admit back in the 90s
[06:29] 1992 1993
[06:31] that was what i was doing all the time
[06:33] you know i just didn't know what i was
[06:35] doing and i was falling victim to myself
[06:37] in just infancy not knowing
[06:39] but
[06:41] the smart money traders
[06:43] are not looking at price
[06:45] with
[06:46] give me a pattern to trade off of you
[06:48] know a bull flag
[06:49] a wedge pattern or something of that
[06:52] effect
[06:54] they're looking at
[06:55] liquidity
[06:57] what is the underlying narrative right
[06:59] now in the marketplace is it bullish is
[07:01] it bearish is the day's daily range
[07:04] going to go higher but how's it going to
[07:07] go higher is it likely to go lower at
[07:08] the beginning of the day first to sucker
[07:10] traders and going short
[07:12] run out sell stops they can acquire long
[07:14] positions at and then rally going into
[07:17] the close or maybe into the afternoon
[07:19] and that would be the extent of their
[07:22] plan of action
[07:24] and how does that speculative uninformed
[07:27] money
[07:28] and its liquidity that it provides how
[07:30] can they utilize that that's the market
[07:32] efficiency paradigm it's efficient
[07:34] for smart money traders to view the
[07:36] marketplace in that perspective
[07:39] versus
[07:41] technical analysis
[07:43] the mumbo jumbo things that traders put
[07:45] on their charts okay
[07:47] and you can lock me in there too because
[07:50] the times where i'm trying to use the
[07:51] logic that i trade with and if it fails
[07:54] i've done something wrong i've
[07:56] interpreted price wrong
[07:59] i thought something was in price
[08:01] and it wasn't there and it rolled over
[08:03] top of it and there it is that's a loss
[08:05] everybody's going to have a losing trade
[08:07] okay
[08:08] but
[08:09] i'm not
[08:10] looking at price
[08:12] with patterns
[08:13] on the sake of just trading
[08:16] for the pattern's sake in other words
[08:18] just because i think i see a pattern
[08:20] there
[08:21] because there's a misnomer that goes
[08:22] around trade what you see
[08:25] well just like the trend is your friend
[08:28] that trend is not your friend when it's
[08:30] at the end and it's reversing okay so
[08:33] there's always a rule to the rule
[08:34] there's always an exception to every
[08:36] rule okay and that's experience
[08:38] but what i've hopefully done in this
[08:41] model so far and i promise this is the
[08:43] end of the boring stuff we'll get into
[08:44] the nuts and bolts
[08:46] i'm stripping everything down
[08:48] and placing components
[08:51] at their logical place and order so that
[08:54] way you can go in the price
[08:56] immediately you don't need 18 months you
[08:59] don't even need four months
[09:01] it's immediate i've received a ton of
[09:04] feedback and i appreciate all that
[09:06] that you all can go into the charts and
[09:08] see these things right away and some of
[09:10] you actually started trading it i'm not
[09:12] asking you to do that i'm not trying to
[09:14] inspire you to do that
[09:16] you need to study it more but that's how
[09:18] quick
[09:19] and different all this is okay this is
[09:22] not your typical
[09:23] ict you know the stale
[09:26] boring stuff this is the things that
[09:28] really work in the marketplace so
[09:31] with that in mind let's continue
[09:34] so i want to give a little bit more
[09:35] specifics about the fair value got that
[09:37] we have the rules
[09:38] what it looks like so that way you
[09:40] understand exactly what it is
[09:42] and where it forms
[09:44] because this is going to repeat
[09:46] every single time it's going to be the
[09:48] same logic that i'm gonna show you here
[09:50] okay do not try to fancy dances okay and
[09:53] try to turn it into some kind of a
[09:55] mentorship course and rename everything
[09:58] with your name and and don't do that
[10:01] okay just
[10:02] take it for what it is
[10:04] i already know people are going to try
[10:05] to take this and copy it and make
[10:06] courses out of it okay
[10:08] i've already given it to you for free
[10:12] if it helps you
[10:13] then god bless you
[10:15] okay all i'm asking for is just
[10:17] appreciate the fact that i've taken the
[10:18] time to put it out here for you
[10:20] so the bearish ict fair value gap
[10:24] this is institutional order flow and
[10:26] it's a pattern that you can see the
[10:28] order flow
[10:30] actually coming into the marketplace
[10:32] when you look at like
[10:35] depth of market
[10:36] okay
[10:37] or if you study volume profile
[10:40] that's a religion okay what you're
[10:43] looking at
[10:44] is data yes
[10:47] but
[10:48] your interpretation
[10:50] is a private
[10:52] interpretation
[10:53] it's
[10:55] what you believe there may be a lot of
[10:58] other traders that have a similar
[10:59] mindset about that very thing but simply
[11:02] because you think that
[11:04] doesn't make it true
[11:06] it doesn't okay
[11:08] so what i'm trying to do is take my
[11:11] students
[11:12] into the marketplace with a chart
[11:15] a time-based chart okay there's some out
[11:17] there that will say time-based charts
[11:19] are useless that's because they don't
[11:21] know how to use a time-based chart
[11:23] because algorithms the first element
[11:24] they operate under is time
[11:28] hello
[11:29] quants
[11:30] so we're looking at
[11:31] what does a bearish ict fair value gap
[11:34] look like well if you
[11:36] take a look at this diagram it's rather
[11:38] crude i know
[11:40] but you have a run preferably above some
[11:42] kind of old high
[11:44] so the first candle is the high
[11:49] and the next candle
[11:50] is
[11:51] the extended low that goes below it
[11:55] the third candle is another continuation
[11:58] candle but the main important factors
[12:00] are this it's a three candle formation
[12:05] the first candle's low
[12:07] has to be traded below
[12:09] on the immediate following candle
[12:13] the next candle has to trade with an
[12:15] extended low as well that went below
[12:18] candle number two
[12:20] but does not trade with a high
[12:23] that trades back to candle number one's
[12:25] low
[12:25] what that creates is this small little
[12:28] gap where one candle only traded from
[12:31] the range of the candle number one's low
[12:34] to candle number three's high so that
[12:36] little space that's occupied right there
[12:39] what is actually occurring there is
[12:42] price
[12:43] is only being offered on the sell side
[12:46] there
[12:47] so imagine if you're painting your wall
[12:48] at your home okay
[12:50] and you take your roller you put it in
[12:51] the paint and you put the paint
[12:53] up against the wall
[12:55] and you roll down
[12:57] okay at first the first foot or so
[13:00] there's going to be a
[13:01] an ample amount of paint delivered to
[13:03] the wall from your paint roller
[13:05] but then as you keep rolling down
[13:07] towards the floor
[13:08] what will happen you'll start seeing
[13:10] these little pockets that look really
[13:12] porous
[13:13] okay
[13:14] what do you have to do to fix that you
[13:17] just change directions and start rolling
[13:19] the paint roller back up the same place
[13:22] you roll down
[13:24] that's exactly what price does
[13:26] there's an algorithm that delivers
[13:28] efficient market delivery
[13:32] you can argue with me all you want
[13:34] you're not going to convince me i know
[13:35] it
[13:37] if you go into price action with that
[13:39] market efficiency paradigm perception
[13:42] looking for this characteristic in price
[13:45] i promise you you will never look at
[13:47] charts the same way again it'll unlock a
[13:50] lot of things we're going to move the
[13:52] matrix
[13:53] and neo finally sees the matrix as it
[13:55] really is in binary code ones and zeros
[13:59] he has clarity well that same event as
[14:02] silly as it may sound ends up happening
[14:05] when you look at price action when you
[14:06] start looking at it from this
[14:07] perspective so let's go back into that
[14:09] analogy with this
[14:10] between this candle is low and this
[14:12] candle is high we only have cell site
[14:14] offered so that's like taking the paint
[14:15] and applying it to the wall and drawing
[14:18] down with the roller
[14:19] but now as you pull down there's little
[14:22] pockets
[14:23] right in here between this candle's low
[14:25] and this candle is high where price has
[14:28] not been efficiently offered
[14:31] for buyers
[14:34] why how's that working
[14:36] well you have sell side being offered
[14:38] here because the market's delivering
[14:40] lower prices it's offering continuously
[14:42] lower prices between this candle is low
[14:44] and this candle is high
[14:46] to efficiently balance out that little
[14:49] inefficient area
[14:51] at some future time the market's going
[14:52] to want to trade back into that
[14:56] area when it does
[15:00] and you're bearish
[15:01] that's a short signal okay you can go
[15:03] short and sell there with the
[15:05] expectation it's going to start to move
[15:06] lower
[15:10] optimal formations of the bearish ict
[15:12] fair value gap will be found after a run
[15:14] into buy side liquidity so
[15:17] it's not a matter of going into charts
[15:18] and looking for this little gap all the
[15:20] time
[15:22] this model i'm teaching you on this
[15:23] youtube channel
[15:25] is meant for you to look for
[15:27] periods where price runs above an old
[15:29] high then it breaks down
[15:32] and then you look for this pattern this
[15:34] is what it looks like
[15:35] you're not looking at anything prior to
[15:37] this candle has absolutely nothing to do
[15:38] with anything except for the fact that
[15:40] we treated above and on high that's a
[15:42] very simple logic isn't it and
[15:45] the run above a
[15:46] single high
[15:47] or multiple highs like a double top okay
[15:50] either one of those fits this criteria
[15:53] so what you're looking for is a pool of
[15:55] liquidity
[15:57] of buy stops resting above these highs
[15:59] that's buy side liquidity
[16:02] smart money will want to trade up into
[16:04] that and go short
[16:06] they may not be
[16:08] engaging above the high they may miss it
[16:10] just like any one of us that haven't
[16:11] been
[16:12] ready to take an order and place it in
[16:15] the marketplace they may miss that
[16:17] this is their
[16:18] saving grace right here this pattern
[16:21] that's what smart money is looking for
[16:22] they're looking for that right there
[16:24] and then once they see that they go in
[16:27] either with their limit order mark it in
[16:29] something to that effect
[16:31] and get short and the stock would be
[16:34] above the high
[16:35] okay there you go short and sweet done
[16:41] that
[16:42] is exactly what you're looking for for a
[16:44] fair value gap so when you're doing your
[16:46] annotations on your charts
[16:48] this is what you want to be doing
[16:50] all your back testing label
[16:52] number one candle
[16:54] the number two candle
[16:56] is always going to be where the gap
[16:57] resides
[16:59] and then the number three candle gives
[17:01] you the lower end the upper end of the
[17:03] fair value gap is going to be the low of
[17:05] candle number one
[17:08] the lower end of the fair value gap is
[17:09] going to be
[17:10] the high of candle number three and the
[17:13] difference between candle number one is
[17:14] low and candle number three is high
[17:17] that's the fair value you got
[17:19] so
[17:21] the easiest entry would be trading just
[17:23] above candle number three's high
[17:26] you can put a limit order right there
[17:27] and be done
[17:29] simple don't have to worry about
[17:30] guessing where to put your limit order
[17:32] in it's right there
[17:34] place your stop
[17:36] right above can number one
[17:38] or you can put it above candle number
[17:39] two
[17:41] but
[17:43] while you're learning how to use
[17:44] this that may seem like a lot of range
[17:48] you want a lot of range when you first
[17:50] start out i'm assuming that all of you
[17:52] are brand new you may not be but i'm
[17:55] teaching it with that perspective in
[17:57] mind
[17:58] some of you
[17:59] that have been with me for a longer time
[18:01] you know how to reduce that stop and i
[18:04] know hearing that by some of you that
[18:05] are new you feel like you're being
[18:07] slighted oh you're holding back no i'm
[18:09] protecting you because i know already
[18:11] some of you already are going out there
[18:12] trying to treat life money and you may
[18:14] be reporting you're doing good but
[18:17] you don't know what you're doing yet
[18:19] okay just
[18:21] trust me you got to practice and do a
[18:23] lot of back testing then demo it
[18:25] then you'll get it
[18:29] the bearish market structure shift
[18:31] what does that look like conceptually
[18:35] well you have the market trading higher
[18:37] short-term little retracement then it
[18:39] trades above an old high or the initial
[18:42] short-term high that it trades above
[18:43] here
[18:44] and then it breaks down
[18:47] once that low is broken
[18:49] that's when the new
[18:50] trade idea is now
[18:53] being birthed you don't even know where
[18:56] you're getting in at yet until you go
[18:58] through this process i'm going to show
[18:59] you right now
[19:01] the market will see a price delivery
[19:05] of a rally
[19:06] above an old high or highs
[19:08] and then quickly shift lower that's this
[19:10] right here
[19:12] now the significance i'm placing on the
[19:14] term quick is linked directly to the
[19:16] term displacement okay it's got to be
[19:19] energetic it can't be a little lethargic
[19:22] little move it's got to show a real
[19:24] willingness to want to go lower
[19:26] and preferably
[19:27] close
[19:29] below
[19:30] that
[19:31] if it does that that to me is a little
[19:33] bit more significant
[19:37] whereas if we
[19:39] just go through this low a little bit
[19:40] like a wick and come back up um
[19:43] that to me is not all that convincing
[19:45] i want to see that it has absolutely
[19:47] displaced and then the candle closed and
[19:49] then we look inside this range here
[19:54] so when you're looking at market
[19:55] structure shifts
[19:57] this is all time frames so don't think
[19:59] this is just the intraday version of it
[20:01] but i'm specifically dealing with
[20:02] intraday
[20:04] so when we create that high that
[20:06] high down to the low that breaks the
[20:08] short-term low here so now we have that
[20:10] shift in market structure there right
[20:12] below that low
[20:13] that is the displacement low
[20:15] this is your displacement high
[20:18] so what's the big deal about that oh
[20:19] you're just trying to add some words ict
[20:21] sound smart that way don't you
[20:24] no it's conceptual ideas being expressed
[20:27] so what you have in between that range
[20:29] that right there
[20:30] you're gonna be hunting your fair value
[20:32] gaps because that's exactly where it's
[20:33] going to form
[20:34] don't take my word for it every one of
[20:36] your examples are going to have this
[20:38] oh
[20:40] don't take my word
[20:42] that's
[20:43] the only thing to believe go into your
[20:46] charts and you will be convinced of it
[20:48] in short order
[20:50] period
[20:52] so if you're bearish
[20:54] and you see price run above an old high
[20:56] then it breaks below the old high and
[20:58] takes out a short term low
[21:01] prior to that run above
[21:03] that short term low being broken
[21:06] draw that out in time that's your
[21:07] displacement low
[21:09] and the high is your displacement height
[21:10] so that range between here and here
[21:12] that's displacement
[21:14] how do you know it's displacement how it
[21:16] closes down here below that low
[21:20] is it just a real short little drop
[21:22] below
[21:24] it might have a fair value gap but it
[21:26] also might be
[21:27] likely to go higher and create another
[21:29] high
[21:30] so that's this is the secret to it here
[21:33] knowing how we trade below that and if
[21:34] it's energetic a lot of movement big a
[21:37] big beefy bearish candle that closes low
[21:41] below this level right there okay if we
[21:44] have that as soon as we have that candle
[21:46] form
[21:47] start watching to see
[21:50] if it creates a fair value gap in
[21:51] between this low and this candle's
[21:54] high or that range okay
[21:56] that's exactly where the fair value gap
[21:59] to sell short will form
[22:00] if there is no fair value gap in here
[22:02] guess what you don't have a trade you
[22:04] wait
[22:05] or go to another market
[22:07] because one of them is going to be there
[22:08] every single trading day okay every
[22:11] single trading day
[22:14] this pattern forms
[22:18] are you telling yes i'm telling you just
[22:20] like that every single trading day
[22:24] this pattern forms
[22:27] every single day long and short
[22:30] but you have to look for it
[22:33] with this process
[22:35] okay
[22:38] everything i teach obviously is reversed
[22:40] the same way so i'll just go through
[22:41] this a lot quicker because this is
[22:42] already becoming a longer video than i
[22:43] wanted it to be but bullish ict fair
[22:45] value gap again institutional order flow
[22:47] pattern and it's three candles formation
[22:49] the
[22:50] candle here is number one the second
[22:52] candle here
[22:53] and the third candle there
[22:56] candle number one's high
[22:58] that is the low of the fair value gap
[23:00] candle number three's
[23:02] low is the high of the fair value gap
[23:05] candle number two is where the fair
[23:06] value gap will be formed
[23:10] so that is your favorite value gap and
[23:11] everything
[23:13] you would expect to see in form of a
[23:15] market run below an old low or multiple
[23:17] lows for sell side liquidity
[23:19] once it starts trading higher and takes
[23:21] out a short term high that's not being
[23:23] shown here okay cause i'm showing you
[23:24] the pattern itself this is what you're
[23:27] looking for okay this separation between
[23:29] three candles
[23:31] that's the criteria
[23:33] you have to blend in the logic of a
[23:36] market structure shift that's bullish
[23:38] so what does that look like you have a
[23:39] market trade below no low
[23:42] and maybe go a low another
[23:44] leg lower and create a run into sell
[23:46] stops
[23:47] once that occurs then you're looking for
[23:49] a run higher that takes out a short term
[23:52] high
[23:53] and it closes above it with an energetic
[23:55] displacement higher
[23:57] once you see that then you have a trade
[23:59] idea being birthed you don't have a
[24:01] trade entry yet until you determine if
[24:03] it has a fair value gap where does that
[24:05] reside
[24:07] between the displacement high
[24:09] and the displacement low
[24:11] in between
[24:12] right before the market structure is
[24:14] broken bullishly and the low that ran
[24:17] into the cell stops
[24:18] that is your range this is exactly where
[24:22] you're looking for a fair value guy
[24:25] so in that range
[24:27] that's where your bullish fair value gap
[24:30] resides if there isn't one there you
[24:32] don't have a trade
[24:34] is that not specific and clear it's
[24:37] perfectly illustrated there's no
[24:39] ambiguity to it it's exactly the logic
[24:42] you're going to use going forward it
[24:44] does not change it doesn't mutate into
[24:46] anything you don't bring something else
[24:48] into it you don't add something else
[24:50] that some other educator has taken my
[24:52] stuff and twisted it up and try to make
[24:53] it sound like something new and they've
[24:54] created themselves no
[24:58] this is what you're supposed to be doing
[25:00] if you do anything other than this
[25:02] you're not going to get the results
[25:03] you're looking for and you're not going
[25:05] to find
[25:07] my ict fair value got
[25:09] okay
[25:12] all right so let's go into the price
[25:13] action you survived you made it here
[25:17] so here we have the 15 minute timing
[25:19] frame from today this is the e-mini
[25:22] nasdaq and this is a 15-minute timing
[25:24] frame this is where i tell you to start
[25:25] this is your bellwether chart
[25:28] naked chart okay pause the video
[25:31] and look and see if you see anything of
[25:33] any importance which swing high
[25:36] would you anchor
[25:38] where is there a
[25:40] stop run on buy stops
[25:43] when you're ready to listen to the rest
[25:44] of the video unpause the video
[25:50] some of you never pause the video
[25:53] alright so we have 8 30 marked here okay
[25:56] very specific right element of time 8 30
[25:59] why because there's news that comes out
[26:00] okay
[26:01] employment data came out today
[26:03] so at 8 30
[26:05] the market
[26:07] from that point on here look to the left
[26:09] what do you see what's the first swing
[26:10] how you come to right there
[26:12] is that hard
[26:14] was that
[26:15] was that complicated
[26:17] no very simple
[26:19] so this high here
[26:22] draw that out in time and you'll get
[26:24] this right here
[26:25] okay
[26:26] but watch
[26:30] with this run right there on a 15 minute
[26:32] time frame
[26:34] what do you do with it
[26:35] well you start stripping down from a top
[26:38] down five minute four minute three
[26:41] minute two minute one minute
[26:43] so once you have this level on your
[26:45] chart on a 50 minute time frame
[26:48] you drop down to your five
[26:50] everything's transposed from the 15 to
[26:52] the five minute you can see it trades
[26:54] above it here
[26:55] and the market starts to trade lower
[26:57] when it's trading lower in here
[27:00] you're going down into what
[27:02] the four minute
[27:06] here we have here is there a fair value
[27:07] gap in here yet
[27:10] nope there's one right there
[27:12] see that
[27:13] right there
[27:14] so we traded below this swing low
[27:16] there's a fair value got right there you
[27:18] can enter there right on this candle's
[27:20] high
[27:21] you can go short there what's the rules
[27:25] do you remember what the rules were
[27:28] you can put your stop above
[27:30] this here or the swing high
[27:32] there's a swing high right there
[27:37] candle number one
[27:39] or the swing high
[27:42] does it hit your stop
[27:43] no this might be more than you're
[27:45] willing to absorb
[27:46] but there's micros
[27:48] you're only trading
[27:50] two dollars per handle there
[27:52] it's not twenty dollars per handle okay
[27:54] or four ticks
[27:55] it's two dollars for each tick or 50
[27:57] cents each tick so that's not a lot of
[28:00] money being risked there but
[28:05] i want to go down and really fine tune
[28:07] it so i'm dropping down through
[28:10] all the time frames five four
[28:13] three
[28:14] two one and if i'm being completely
[28:16] honest with you i have those charts all
[28:18] open
[28:19] at the same time across my desk
[28:21] so i'm constantly referring to all of
[28:23] them now you can do that
[28:25] cycling through rather quickly
[28:28] and just look for the form
[28:33] in the two-minute chart
[28:35] you don't have a fair value gap in here
[28:36] until there as well same entry and you
[28:39] can put a stop there as well
[28:42] and on the one minute chart
[28:45] we have the run here
[28:46] the break below
[28:49] the short term low here
[28:53] fair value gap
[28:55] straight up into that look how many
[28:56] times it gives you a chance to get in
[28:58] this candle that's one
[29:00] two
[29:01] three
[29:04] then it continues even lower so you're
[29:06] getting a really really tight entry
[29:07] there
[29:08] now
[29:10] some of you gonna say oh yes guys talk
[29:12] about hindsight
[29:15] i got you covered
[29:17] i actually went in and traded this today
[29:19] on trading view
[29:21] and you'll see me entering right here
[29:24] and writing down and taking out my
[29:28] exits
[29:29] below
[29:30] an old low but i'm going to also teach
[29:32] you
[29:33] how you can
[29:34] use the model here and use the exit
[29:37] strategy i use today
[29:39] for external range liquidity
[29:41] oh something new so let's go over to
[29:43] trading view
[29:44] all right so i'm going to kill two
[29:45] bursts of one stone here
[29:47] i don't
[29:48] use the replay button this is going to
[29:50] be the first time you've ever seen me
[29:52] use it but it's only for the
[29:54] purpose of teaching
[29:56] how you if you can't watch live data
[29:59] okay
[30:00] just
[30:01] use this i guess is the best thing you
[30:03] can i guess have
[30:05] as an alternative
[30:07] also i'm not sure if i mentioned this in
[30:10] the past but if you are going to
[30:12] tradingview.com and you're pulling up
[30:14] the symbol
[30:16] nqh2022 and you're going into a
[30:18] one-minute chart
[30:19] the data is delayed here and to be quite
[30:22] honest which i don't recall if it's 10
[30:24] minutes or 20 minutes or i don't know
[30:25] exactly i don't remember what the delay
[30:27] was but i pay the four dollar a month
[30:29] subscription rate to get the e-mini data
[30:32] and
[30:33] i also have a professional account so
[30:35] i'm not sure if that four dollars a
[30:37] month is because i have a professional
[30:39] account
[30:40] or if it's just four dollars for anyone
[30:42] so you'll have to investigate yourself
[30:44] to see if that's something you want to
[30:45] do
[30:46] you don't need to have that data while
[30:48] you're learning okay
[30:50] you can use this function here so while
[30:53] i do have real time data because if i
[30:55] didn't you'd see like a little orange d
[30:57] up here letter d
[31:00] that would uh basically communicate to
[31:02] anyone that would see the chart that
[31:04] it's a delayed data
[31:06] this is live data and i have it scrolled
[31:09] to this morning
[31:10] for february 3rd 2022
[31:14] and i have my chart delineated with the
[31:16] 15 minute high with that level and
[31:19] i'll show you this and then we'll zoom
[31:20] back out to a 15 minute chart you can
[31:22] see everything as it was because i'm
[31:23] going to show you there was actually a
[31:24] trading
[31:25] entered on this today
[31:27] but
[31:29] you want to have a vertical line dealing
[31:30] needed on trading the way you do that is
[31:32] simply go in here
[31:34] pick the vertical line and drop it right
[31:36] there at 8 30
[31:38] and there it is okay
[31:40] so
[31:41] for the replay button and i feel weird
[31:44] just doing this because i just don't do
[31:46] it but i have to do it because i know
[31:48] students
[31:49] need this resource while they're
[31:50] learning okay
[31:52] but i i don't use this my mentorship
[31:55] that paid me to get education knows i
[31:58] never even use this okay but i'm showing
[32:00] you so that way you can back test and
[32:02] practice and look at price action in a
[32:04] way where it means something more than
[32:06] just looking at a static chart
[32:08] all right so
[32:11] it started at the 8 30 hour our line
[32:14] here is at that 15 minute high so what
[32:17] we're expecting is a run above that high
[32:19] okay
[32:21] and i'll keep it kind of quick i don't
[32:23] want to spend too much time with this
[32:25] so clicking the play button
[32:28] we're running above a short term high
[32:29] right here there's a fair value got
[32:31] right there hit that now watch it should
[32:32] sell off that's not what i want i want
[32:35] to use this high back here but if you're
[32:36] a scalper you could take that low out
[32:39] right there and that would have been a
[32:40] trade there as well but for the daily
[32:42] range which is much more significant
[32:47] i'm using the 15 minute high i'm bearish
[32:50] one day i'm expecting lower prices
[32:52] because we've already went up a lot on
[32:54] the daily chart
[32:56] so now if you're waiting all day you
[32:58] might look at this and say oh i missed
[33:00] it there's nothing for me to do don't
[33:01] think like that okay because the equity
[33:03] market opens at 9 30 stock markets start
[33:07] getting really busy and volatile around
[33:08] that time frame
[33:11] and we're coming up on it in a few
[33:12] minutes here
[33:16] and usually not always but usually the
[33:18] first
[33:19] run at 9 30
[33:21] is opposite
[33:23] to what the real move you want to be
[33:25] doing not every time now here here's a
[33:27] 930 volatility look how crazy it gets
[33:31] okay it's creating a low
[33:34] with another low here so there's what
[33:35] what's building underneath that
[33:37] sell stops traders are being induced
[33:40] into thinking long trades go long go
[33:43] long go buy and get in there and go high
[33:46] buy low sell high right
[33:48] but it's it's sloppy in here
[33:51] but it's keeping these lows over here
[33:53] intact
[33:57] above these highs that's where my
[33:59] interest is okay
[34:01] so i don't have a trade until we get up
[34:04] above this level there
[34:06] and this is on a one minute chart
[34:16] okay small little shallow run
[34:18] we want something that's going to push
[34:19] through it
[34:22] no favorite value got filmed anyway
[34:26] okay i just paused it right there now
[34:28] look at this initial poke above that
[34:31] high that we've drawn a line on it went
[34:34] above it
[34:35] it went down yes did it create
[34:39] any fair value gaps in it no every
[34:40] candle overlaps there's no gaps there
[34:42] okay there's also no swing low taken out
[34:47] so there's nothing in here yet
[34:49] now we have a higher high running above
[34:52] this high and the high we're looking at
[34:53] on the 15 minute timeframe which is
[34:54] denoted by that horizontal line
[34:57] right there now we have the likelihood
[35:00] we if we're watching it live we're
[35:02] waiting to see does it
[35:04] break lower
[35:06] if it breaks lower
[35:08] where is there a swing low
[35:10] right there
[35:11] so if we can trade down below that swing
[35:13] low
[35:14] and as soon as it does that
[35:17] look in the highest high that forms
[35:20] and that low
[35:21] see if there's a fair value got the
[35:23] forms
[35:28] right there
[35:31] we went below it
[35:34] after taking out the high
[35:36] here's your number one candle
[35:39] the number two candle
[35:41] and the number three candle
[35:42] so there's your gap right in here
[35:45] so if it trades back this candle's high
[35:47] plus
[35:49] i don't know one handle
[35:51] or
[35:52] one tick maybe two ticks whatever
[35:55] whatever you believe is an ideal entry
[35:57] for you the easiest one to is just go
[36:00] one tick
[36:01] above that and removes all the doubt and
[36:04] there's no guesswork there there it is
[36:06] and where's your stop loss going to be
[36:07] above the high of candle number two
[36:10] or you can use above
[36:12] candle number one which creates a swing
[36:14] high okay whichever one you can afford
[36:17] and allows you
[36:19] to put the trade on
[36:21] some of you are going to look at to say
[36:22] oh this is too much risk okay then don't
[36:24] take the trade i'm just i'm giving you a
[36:27] model that works
[36:34] boom right there that candle
[36:37] if you had a limit order right there
[36:39] that would trip you in going short and
[36:41] your stop would have to be above here
[36:48] another one right there there's your
[36:50] second entry right above this candle
[36:51] here that's entering that's your limit
[36:54] order getting in go short
[36:56] same stop
[37:03] third
[37:04] opportunity
[37:06] almost completely closes in all that
[37:07] range right there see that
[37:11] right there
[37:13] if you see that live it feels like it's
[37:16] going to keep going higher because this
[37:18] candle at one time when it was at the
[37:19] high was all green and bold
[37:24] you need to trust and train yourself
[37:26] to look at this pattern as it's forming
[37:28] because once you see dozens of it
[37:30] occurring
[37:33] it changes your perspective you don't
[37:35] get scared in fact it's
[37:38] fascinating to anticipate okay it went
[37:41] here so now
[37:42] it's going to go lower so at that point
[37:46] right there at that entry
[37:48] from this candle's low to this candle's
[37:50] high where's about 50
[37:52] about right here right
[37:54] so
[37:55] before we go any further where do we
[37:57] take our profits
[37:59] well you have a fair value gap right
[38:01] there right
[38:02] you see that
[38:03] same thing just going up candle number
[38:05] one
[38:06] it's high kindle number two
[38:10] and number three the low the range
[38:12] between candle number one's high and the
[38:14] third candle is low that's your favorite
[38:16] value gap so if you're selling short up
[38:19] here
[38:19] you can buy it back below here because
[38:21] you're below 50 of the range that it
[38:24] range
[38:25] from high to low you're at a discount
[38:28] down here so there's your first target
[38:30] remember those equal lows down here i
[38:32] was telling you about what's below that
[38:34] sell stops
[38:36] so you want to be taking profits here
[38:41] and or here this is ideal okay
[38:46] let's go back and watch the rest of it
[38:54] right there that's it
[38:55] these are minute candles so you're
[38:57] selling short here or maybe you entered
[38:59] on the first one here so that's minute
[39:00] one so one minute two minute three
[39:02] minute four minute five minutes six
[39:04] minutes seven eight nine ten eleven
[39:06] minutes
[39:08] and you have
[39:09] 10 20 30 40 50
[39:13] we'll call it 60
[39:15] we'll just call it 60. 60 handles
[39:19] in minutes
[39:20] okay
[39:23] that's
[39:25] literally over a thousand dollars
[39:27] in a matter of time that would probably
[39:30] be
[39:31] longer spent for someone that smokes a
[39:33] cigarette
[39:36] think about that
[39:39] if you are going to hold it
[39:53] focusing below these lows down here okay
[40:15] trust the bias
[40:20] that type of move right there is
[40:21] intended to upset traders and get out
[40:24] and if they trailer stop lost too short
[40:27] and aggressively they get knocked out
[40:28] right before the big move comes down
[40:30] takes out the
[40:31] lows down here
[40:32] so we're looking at
[40:36] right in here well let's look for 14
[40:39] 680.
[40:54] there it is
[40:56] now
[40:57] is that a lot of time
[41:00] getting short here
[41:01] weathering some of this you already took
[41:03] first partial down here
[41:05] so even with this pulling back your stop
[41:08] stays here
[41:10] you use the first partial
[41:12] to
[41:13] kind of like quench that desire to roll
[41:15] your stop don't do that
[41:17] if you do that you're probably gonna get
[41:18] stopped out because you don't have the
[41:20] understanding or the experience to know
[41:21] where to place a protective stop while
[41:23] it's being trailed
[41:26] once it takes this low out down here and
[41:28] if you want to hold on to position then
[41:30] you can roll your stop to here
[41:32] but not before why because you've taken
[41:34] out a significant intermediate term low
[41:37] this low
[41:38] that is high on a one minute chart
[41:40] that's an intermittent term
[41:42] price swing
[41:43] so it's taken out here
[41:46] but it's also a full target
[41:48] for selling short up here and getting
[41:50] out down here so what was the
[41:53] rough price level we used
[41:55] well let's look at the high here
[41:59] 14 we'll just call it 14 800 just for
[42:03] sake of the math
[42:04] so
[42:05] 100
[42:08] 100 handles is 14 700 and then we have
[42:13] the 80
[42:15] fourteen thousand six eighty so
[42:17] 120
[42:19] handles
[42:20] that's a significant price move
[42:23] using exactly what i've taught in this
[42:25] model
[42:27] now
[42:28] for those out there to
[42:30] say oh this
[42:32] replay button he uses the replay button
[42:34] that's the first time and make sure you
[42:37] remember the date
[42:39] because that's the first time you see me
[42:40] ever do
[42:42] market replay on trading view
[42:44] so if you look at this area in here
[42:47] i'm going to show you paper trading
[42:49] account oh i said we were going to talk
[42:50] about that
[42:52] here is the account history
[42:55] here you go the time
[42:59] put a shorter on let's take a look at
[43:02] where that actually occurs on the chart
[43:06] and i'll show you the execution
[43:09] right
[43:10] there two
[43:13] minis
[43:19] fourteen thousand seven ninety two and a
[43:21] half and i think i was reading that
[43:22] wrong down here because i was showing
[43:24] you the exit
[43:25] yeah
[43:28] close the short position yeah i read it
[43:29] wrong sorry
[43:30] so the entry price here
[43:33] selling short two minis at 14 792 and a
[43:36] half
[43:37] using the favorite value
[43:38] got holding on to it
[43:43] first partial here
[43:46] fourteen thousand six seventy five and
[43:49] then the limit order i had here
[43:52] was fourteen thousand six forty seven
[43:55] so
[43:57] how does that look on the grand scheme
[43:58] of things
[44:04] getting short here with that logic below
[44:06] the cell stops
[44:08] down here and in the limit order there
[44:10] and
[44:11] hopefully you've got something from this
[44:13] and you've seen that there is
[44:15] obviously
[44:17] more to it than just fluff
[44:20] it keeps repeating how many examples
[44:21] have you seen already since i started
[44:23] teaching this it's there and these are
[44:25] the two
[44:27] this is the first
[44:28] uh order covered and this is the second
[44:30] one okay
[44:31] don't look at this and say oh my gosh
[44:33] he's got 52 return and one day on first
[44:36] trade
[44:37] that's nothing
[44:39] that's nothing but i don't want you
[44:41] thinking that's what you can do okay
[44:43] don't think that please don't think that
[44:45] at all all i want you to do is practice
[44:46] on
[44:47] this logic
[44:49] it's a simple process
[44:51] so now
[44:53] in closing
[44:55] i revisited the idea of
[44:58] this high to that low that's your range
[45:00] okay
[45:01] if you put a fibonacci on that
[45:05] man i tell you i wish i had this stuff
[45:06] and i was coming up
[45:09] god coming in here for free look at this
[45:11] so we have 50
[45:13] that's your equilibrium so everything
[45:15] above that price level because this low
[45:17] to that high that's our price run
[45:20] and
[45:22] 50
[45:23] below it is discount so there's your
[45:25] little fair value got right there you
[45:26] see that
[45:27] that right there
[45:29] that's your target
[45:31] going short there
[45:33] but this is internal range liquidity
[45:35] because it's internal
[45:37] relative to this low and this high that
[45:39] range so it's in the middle of that
[45:41] range which makes it internal range
[45:43] liquidity
[45:44] what is the stops below these lows down
[45:47] here
[45:49] external range liquidity
[45:51] so
[45:52] partials
[45:54] internal range
[45:57] external range
[45:59] your trade
[46:02] very simple logic isn't it
[46:04] is there a lot of moving parts
[46:05] did i confuse you
[46:07] simple isn't it
[46:10] you may still have questions because you
[46:12] may be entirely brand new to charting
[46:15] and trading that's normal
[46:18] but by practicing and following along in
[46:19] this in this video series it's an
[46:21] ongoing mentorship it's not going to
[46:22] stop next week okay
[46:24] this
[46:25] will help you understand but i have to
[46:27] give it to you in bite-sized pieces
[46:29] because i give you too much
[46:31] you know it's
[46:33] not going to be meaningful to you
[46:35] but the logic hopefully even if you
[46:36] don't understand what i'm
[46:38] drawing you to in your own chart like
[46:41] you can't find it yet on your own chart
[46:42] i'm showing you exactly where it forms
[46:45] and is every example i've shown you
[46:47] happening in the time of the day
[46:49] the same way each time and is it
[46:52] performing as i taught it
[46:54] yes
[46:56] that's a model that's a trading plan
[46:59] that's an executable idea
[47:02] that you can go in and engage with a
[47:03] demo account
[47:05] and over time
[47:06] you get good at this
[47:08] you determine what you want to do with
[47:09] it i'm never going to say go and trade
[47:12] live money with it
[47:13] but
[47:14] i already have people already that have
[47:17] been trading for a while
[47:19] they're a little bit more versed than
[47:20] some of you if you're brand new it's
[47:22] okay but
[47:23] traders that have been doing live fun
[47:25] trading for a while
[47:28] this really resonated with them
[47:30] and they could see it and it wouldn't
[47:31] enter this week and they were catching
[47:32] trades
[47:33] real trades
[47:35] and
[47:36] like i said i don't want the credit for
[47:38] that
[47:38] but
[47:39] i already know this stuff works it's
[47:42] sending me emails telling me that this
[47:43] is amazing and it's great
[47:45] please don't do that you don't need to
[47:46] do that i already know it works i'm
[47:48] giving it to you so that way you can be
[47:51] fascinated by it okay this is just one
[47:53] model
[47:54] of dozens that i have and this is the
[47:56] stripped down version so hopefully
[47:59] you find insight and
[48:02] obviously you know benefit from
[48:03] following it and if you don't
[48:05] you know
[48:06] i'm sorry i didn't scratch that itch for
[48:08] you i'm sure if you study other things
[48:10] in my youtube channel you'll probably
[48:11] find something else that tickles your
[48:13] fancy until i talk to you next tuesday
[48:16] enjoy weekend and be safe
