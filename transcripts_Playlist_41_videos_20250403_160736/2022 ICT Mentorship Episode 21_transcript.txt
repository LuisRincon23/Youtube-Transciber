[00:05] all right folks welcome back
[00:07] this is our
[00:09] 21st
[00:11] episode
[00:12] of the
[00:14] 2022 free ict youtube mentorship
[00:18] little
[00:19] tongue twister there
[00:21] so we're looking at the
[00:23] hourly chart on the dollar index why are
[00:26] we here why are we looking at this
[00:28] well i'm looking at this because i want
[00:29] to show you the relationships between a
[00:32] risk on and risk off market
[00:35] if you've been following along in the
[00:36] comment section and if you haven't paid
[00:38] attention or even noticed
[00:40] all my videos
[00:42] in this mentorship the comment section
[00:44] is open okay so
[00:47] you're welcome to
[00:49] make your
[00:50] appreciation known you're welcome to
[00:53] you know
[00:54] prompt me with specific questions that
[00:56] you want to see me kind of like
[00:59] touch on without
[01:01] making uh
[01:02] you know too much of a long-winded
[01:04] request for it
[01:06] i can kind of get a feel for what you're
[01:07] looking for and i'll work those ideas
[01:10] into the lessons that we can
[01:12] hopefully get everybody's understanding
[01:13] on the same page
[01:16] i may not respond to your post i mean
[01:18] not
[01:19] you know
[01:20] directly answering sometimes if it's
[01:22] short and easy i'll do that but if it's
[01:23] a question i see a lot of across the
[01:25] other videos as well
[01:27] i use the videos to kind of like answer
[01:29] it so it's important to take notes
[01:31] because usually
[01:32] you'll find that the questions you have
[01:34] are answered in the progression through
[01:36] this mentorship if you're coming here
[01:38] later than 2022
[01:40] all right so one of the questions i got
[01:43] and i get this a lot for people that
[01:45] have not been trained by me
[01:47] the idea of
[01:48] using the dollar index is it useful like
[01:50] when i look at the forex market like if
[01:52] the dollar is going higher obviously
[01:54] that's going to put pressure
[01:56] on the foreign currencies and it'll be
[02:00] less likely for them to have sustained
[02:01] rallies they're more likely to have
[02:04] sustained declines so dollar up foreign
[02:06] currency down dollar down foreign
[02:08] currency up
[02:10] the reason why that's occurring is it's
[02:11] a risk on risk off scenario
[02:14] dollar if it is going up as we have here
[02:17] this is a risk off scenario okay risk
[02:21] off scenario implies that
[02:23] generally every other market or asset
[02:26] class will start to
[02:28] decline
[02:30] and this is treated as like a flight to
[02:32] quality okay or a safe haven
[02:35] so money pours into the dollar
[02:37] and it pours out of
[02:39] risk assets that would be like foreign
[02:41] currency
[02:42] that's why i've been telling you to look
[02:44] at the euro dollar to go lower and make
[02:46] a new low on this daily chart and
[02:49] today it did it
[02:50] and now it's random
[02:52] then also this applies as well to the
[02:57] stock market and index market
[03:00] so obviously i'm kind of like
[03:02] pushing
[03:03] the index futures in this mentorship on
[03:06] youtube
[03:07] but it's applicable obviously everything
[03:09] i'm teaching here is universal so it
[03:11] works in everything now i'm not
[03:12] co-signing crypto as a reminder i do not
[03:14] trade cryptocurrency i have absolutely
[03:16] zero experience trading cryptocurrency
[03:18] outside of a demo account or a paper
[03:20] trading account i've never done anything
[03:22] with it i've never opened up a crypto
[03:24] account
[03:25] i have no interest in ever going into
[03:27] that asset class and
[03:29] there it is okay i see a lot of you
[03:32] asking that in the comment section so
[03:33] i'm going to try to throw this out there
[03:35] every now and then as a reminder because
[03:37] i don't do anything with that asset
[03:38] class a lot of students that trade them
[03:41] and they swear by my concepts work in
[03:43] there but i personally
[03:44] don't do it okay so
[03:47] there's that
[03:48] i am a forex and futures trader so that
[03:51] way you guys can know what my specialty
[03:53] is and
[03:54] i want to show you this chart here and
[03:56] remind you of what i mentioned in the
[03:59] previous week
[04:01] in our meetings together in episodes i
[04:03] said that we would likely see the dollar
[04:05] index
[04:06] drop down if i was making the market for
[04:08] the dollar i would see it go down to
[04:11] around 99.92
[04:13] can go back and listen to the videos and
[04:15] obviously
[04:16] you'll see it it's there and hear it
[04:18] then i said i would run the relative
[04:20] equal highs and start to run it higher
[04:22] i gave you the objectives of
[04:25] relative equal highs and mentioned like
[04:27] 102 103 and you know even my private
[04:30] mentorship group knows there's
[04:31] objectives as well and we have it here
[04:34] okay
[04:35] so
[04:36] i'll leave it up to you whether or not
[04:37] you find this
[04:39] inspiring or not knowing that this was
[04:41] likely to occur for a london setup and
[04:42] then rally higher
[04:44] i want you to look at the relationship
[04:46] between this price move here
[04:49] and go back into commentary where i was
[04:51] referring to that daily bearish order
[04:52] block
[04:53] on the index feature okay so i was
[04:56] talking about the
[04:57] the low of the daily order block
[05:00] the open of the order block
[05:02] and the mean threshold halfway and then
[05:04] the high of the order block being the
[05:05] less likely level be traded to and i'll
[05:08] talk about that when we get into the
[05:09] e-mini s p portion of this episode but
[05:11] for now let's take a look at what the
[05:13] relationship looks like with the dollar
[05:16] versus the e-mini s p
[05:18] so this is the june contract for 2022 of
[05:21] the e-mini s p futures market and you
[05:24] can see as the dollar creates its
[05:25] important low that i called publicly you
[05:27] guys know it i've said it i explained it
[05:30] to you in detail
[05:32] as this dollar was going higher
[05:34] what was going on in the e-mini s p
[05:38] see that inverted relationship there
[05:40] that's why i could go back and listen to
[05:41] the recording when i was talking about
[05:43] that bearish order block on the e-mini s
[05:46] p i said that we're going into may and
[05:49] it's usually a seasonal decline and i'm
[05:51] going to be looking for signatures to
[05:54] warrant
[05:55] downward pressure
[05:56] in this particular asset class and
[05:59] reaching for those relatively equal lows
[06:00] on the daily chart
[06:02] hello look at your chart folks this is
[06:05] this is what it's like to be mentored
[06:07] this is what it's like to know what's
[06:09] likely to occur with tools that make
[06:11] sense there's nothing ambiguous here
[06:14] there's nothing
[06:16] you know splattered across the chart
[06:18] it's just simple sound logic
[06:21] okay
[06:22] i'm hopefully
[06:24] inspiring you to simplify which
[06:27] many on the outside looking at what i do
[06:29] will make
[06:30] snipe remarks like oh he over
[06:32] complicates things and i'm not
[06:34] complicating anything
[06:35] these are very simple ideas and it helps
[06:38] you build the idea of bias
[06:40] it gives you intermarket relationships
[06:42] and intermarket analysis
[06:44] to give you
[06:45] the the trust okay why did i feel you
[06:49] know confident to publicly say
[06:51] that 99.92 level well i explained that
[06:54] why did i think it was going to rally
[06:55] from there because i'm bullish on dollar
[06:57] why did i hint that we're going to be
[06:58] going lower into the e-mini s p e
[07:01] relative equal lows and as we enter into
[07:04] may that's a seasonal tendency
[07:06] so all those factors came together
[07:09] and my experience of almost 30 years was
[07:11] used
[07:12] to hint at something
[07:14] for you to study and if i'm right or if
[07:17] i'm wrong you get to be a judge okay you
[07:19] get to see and weigh me in the balances
[07:22] i've laid it out there in your hands
[07:24] you see right now in this chart what i
[07:27] was forecasting
[07:29] the reasons why i was doing it why i
[07:31] said what i said and why it looks like
[07:33] it does in your chart today
[07:37] all right so here's that daily chart and
[07:39] here's that bearish order block i was
[07:41] referring to and the high i said is the
[07:42] level we don't look for it to be traded
[07:44] to
[07:45] and you can see we didn't even get to it
[07:47] there okay so we route up into the order
[07:49] block and then we had the weakness that
[07:51] was expected as we go into that may
[07:53] month and we're reaching into these
[07:54] relative equal lows
[07:56] that's the next draw on liquidity but
[07:58] for now again just keep your
[08:00] study inside this order block
[08:02] that's taught in this youtube channel
[08:04] okay
[08:06] so while it's not a
[08:08] main factor in the model i'm teaching in
[08:12] the
[08:13] mentorship for youtube here
[08:15] i leaned on that as a basis for my
[08:18] analysis why i felt this was likely to
[08:21] go lower
[08:22] that's the order block that's the one
[08:24] that makes
[08:25] the
[08:27] likelihood
[08:29] of the market turning in this area and
[08:32] then going lower and attacking the south
[08:34] side below here
[08:37] below the relative equal lows here is
[08:38] next and then this low here so
[08:40] ultimately we're looking for a run below
[08:42] here for the cell side now it might want
[08:44] to go down below here and give a little
[08:45] bit of a retracement if it leaves this
[08:47] portion open
[08:48] that might want to
[08:50] rally from going under here up there i
[08:52] don't think it would do that personally
[08:54] but it could happen
[08:56] but it's likely to you draw into that
[08:59] old low here
[09:00] now how we trade once we get there
[09:04] that'll be interesting because i don't
[09:05] know if it's going to accelerate
[09:07] violently to the downside or if we're
[09:09] going to have a sharp retracement higher
[09:12] i don't know that okay i don't care to
[09:14] know that right now i'm just looking for
[09:16] and submitting to the idea that we're
[09:18] going to keep drawing down on the daily
[09:20] chart each daily candle should be
[09:22] expanding lower
[09:24] and reaching into this area okay that's
[09:26] what i'm expecting that's my ideal
[09:28] scenario
[09:30] now
[09:31] if you look at the daily range here
[09:33] today
[09:34] we had a little bit of movement above
[09:35] the previous day so we rallied above
[09:37] monday's high
[09:38] and then failed
[09:41] and accelerated to the downside
[09:43] fell short of just running below these
[09:45] relative equal lows but i still believe
[09:46] that's where we're likely to go
[09:50] a little bit of consolidation in here
[09:52] dropped and we had a nice rally in here
[09:55] now admittedly
[09:56] listen closely folks because this is one
[09:58] of those times where
[10:00] i didn't get it right and i have no
[10:02] problem telling you
[10:04] i was expecting this to rally just a
[10:06] little bit higher and maybe flirt with
[10:09] that 4320 level i thought that we could
[10:11] get one more spike up into that and then
[10:13] i was expecting to roll over
[10:15] and go lower that did not happen okay so
[10:19] let's go into the lower time frame 15
[10:21] minute time frame
[10:24] here is the midnight hour new york time
[10:27] and the opening price there notice we
[10:29] only had one two little
[10:31] moves above that
[10:33] and that's a really anemic movement for
[10:35] what i was expecting a little bit more
[10:37] pronounced
[10:38] rally higher i wanted to see a little
[10:39] bit of judith swing about 20 handles 15
[10:42] handles to that effect like that and
[10:44] then break down and create something
[10:45] like this okay but we didn't get it so
[10:49] some of you
[10:50] may be asking and i believe it was
[10:52] michelle
[10:54] in the comment section
[10:55] mentioned that uh
[10:57] it didn't appear that power three was in
[11:00] effect today it actually was but
[11:02] sometimes it's really really small
[11:04] little movements like this and it may
[11:06] not be useful to you
[11:07] but what happens is when you enter the
[11:10] london session which we do here
[11:12] at three o'clock in the morning it
[11:14] breaks down relative to new york local
[11:16] time okay so three a.m new york local
[11:19] time there's a lot of folks in the
[11:20] comments section that are referring to
[11:23] and confused about daylight savings time
[11:25] and such
[11:26] all of that is resolved if you simply
[11:28] just listen to the instructions i gave
[11:30] every single time i mentioned the time
[11:32] aspect
[11:33] if you use
[11:35] this little area down here on trading
[11:36] view and toggle it to new york
[11:39] and all you do is by clicking it a
[11:40] window will pop up scroll to where it
[11:42] says new york you highlight that one
[11:45] click it and then you're set you don't
[11:46] have to worry about it don't worry about
[11:48] daylight savings time don't worry about
[11:50] you know
[11:51] anything as long as you are aware of
[11:53] what local time is in new york set a
[11:55] clock on your computer that always
[11:57] tracks the local time in new york 24 7
[11:59] 365 days a year if you do that you'll
[12:02] never have any confusion about what you
[12:04] should be doing relative to time okay
[12:07] so if you have
[12:09] a small little movement like this
[12:12] it can throw you off if you're expecting
[12:14] like i was i wanted to see a little bit
[12:16] higher rally so in the morning i was
[12:18] looking for maybe a little poke above
[12:21] here didn't happen we broke down
[12:26] retraced back in bearish order block
[12:29] and the imbalance
[12:31] and spent a little bit of time here and
[12:33] then rolled over right before the 9 30
[12:36] opening okay and i'm going to talk a
[12:38] little bit about the 8 30 and the 9 30
[12:41] what times
[12:43] you know are useful what are they
[12:45] beneficial
[12:46] to your analysis and what
[12:49] you should be concerned about okay
[12:50] because there's a lot of questions about
[12:52] that
[12:53] but ultimately we moved into the lunch
[12:56] hour had a little bit of retracement
[12:57] here broke down once more and then
[13:00] aggressive selling really aggressive
[13:02] selling into the pm session into the
[13:05] close of the day
[13:09] if you look at the
[13:11] opening price
[13:12] at midnight local time
[13:14] new i'm sorry new york midnight local
[13:16] time that's what this here is
[13:19] that's the opening price
[13:21] this price is useful for trading the
[13:24] london session that's two o'clock and
[13:26] five o'clock in the morning new york
[13:27] local time
[13:29] and
[13:30] it helps me
[13:32] frame the power 3 for the daily range if
[13:34] i'm bearish i'm looking for something to
[13:36] rally above
[13:38] that opening price in london that's my
[13:40] ideal scenario i'm looking for that
[13:42] personally as you can see we really
[13:44] didn't get much of that today it was
[13:46] extremely heavy and just wilted and went
[13:48] lower
[13:49] sometimes that's going to happen folks
[13:52] and in
[13:53] this instance i missed a setup i don't
[13:56] get in what i'm thinking i'm expecting
[13:58] to see so
[14:01] i'm human
[14:03] you're human you're going to look at
[14:04] something in the chart and you're going
[14:06] to have something that is your favorite
[14:07] model uh whatever pattern is you're
[14:10] looking for and it may not even be my
[14:12] stuff you know say you're just here
[14:13] casually watching
[14:14] you're probably not in your head saying
[14:16] yeah i've had lots of instances where i
[14:17] was looking for my particular setup and
[14:19] it didn't materialize and it went the
[14:21] other way without me
[14:22] you're going to miss moves you're going
[14:24] to misinterpret it you're going to read
[14:25] it wrong that's
[14:27] going to happen that's why you have to
[14:29] use a stop loss that's why you have to
[14:30] be controlled about how many times you
[14:33] go into the marketplace and you also
[14:35] have to have some measure of flexibility
[14:37] and that comes with experience you're
[14:39] not going to always be able to see that
[14:41] this isn't going to go up for you
[14:43] initially it's just going to just wilt
[14:45] and go the other direction so
[14:48] when we get into the 8 30 hour and i
[14:50] have the lines really light here because
[14:52] i want to be able to show where the
[14:53] highs and the lows were on the
[14:55] respective candles so this is the 8 30
[14:58] and this is the 12 8 am
[15:00] midnight candle in new york
[15:03] so this is new york
[15:05] and this is
[15:07] midnight new york so there's a
[15:08] distinction here
[15:10] the beginning of the day
[15:12] this is where i look for
[15:15] the daily range power 3 setup and or
[15:19] the
[15:21] ideal scenario from bear so i want to
[15:22] see something rally above that opening
[15:23] price if i'm bullish i want to see it
[15:25] decline below that opening price okay
[15:28] that's pretty much the basis for the
[15:30] opening price at midnight
[15:33] it may not be a factor for you
[15:36] like it is here it's not much of a use
[15:39] you know for anything except for
[15:42] well here it opened and it just
[15:44] basically
[15:45] went lower from there
[15:48] at 8 30 the same thing i look for those
[15:50] types of scenarios now i'm looking for
[15:52] weaker prices i'm looking for it to
[15:54] trade lower
[15:55] and does it rally above
[15:58] the 830 opening price
[16:00] it never does it's too heavy it just
[16:03] wilts okay keeps going lower
[16:05] now
[16:07] the opening price at 8 30 i use that for
[16:10] again power 3 for the new york session
[16:13] the same thought process i'm using for
[16:16] the opening price at midnight in new
[16:18] york time
[16:20] that opening price fund bears i want to
[16:21] see a move above that's what i dub a
[16:23] judas swing a false rally or a suspect
[16:26] rally i usually like to fade those types
[16:28] of moves as it goes up i sell right into
[16:29] it it's scary for someone who doesn't
[16:31] understand what you're looking at
[16:32] but if you know what you're looking for
[16:34] and it takes a lot of experience and
[16:36] learning and back testing and seeing
[16:38] things
[16:39] you'll be able to do those types of
[16:40] things over time
[16:42] but that same element of trying to look
[16:45] for a short above that opening price in
[16:47] new york when i'm bearish i would expect
[16:50] the same thing to happen for the new
[16:51] york session
[16:52] a rally above that opening price at 8 30
[16:55] and then decline so i'm looking for
[16:57] something to rally above that and fade
[16:59] it but it isn't doing it today so now
[17:01] look what's occurring here this is
[17:03] really important that you understand
[17:04] this part of it
[17:06] you know that i've been bearish i've
[17:07] made it public knowledge here
[17:10] did we rally above the opening price at
[17:11] midnight no
[17:14] did we rally above the opening price at
[17:15] 8 30
[17:16] no
[17:17] and we're bearish
[17:19] what does that indicate to you
[17:22] obviously with the benefit of hindsight
[17:24] it's extremely bearish it can't even
[17:27] rally to a short-term premium above the
[17:30] opening price at key levels
[17:32] and time
[17:34] so
[17:35] we have extremely heavy bearish market
[17:39] so it's not going to give us these
[17:41] stunning little short-term rallies that
[17:43] we can feed
[17:45] it's just going to stay heavy and
[17:48] either you get in
[17:49] where you can find small little pockets
[17:51] of imbalance
[17:52] or you miss the move entirely
[17:56] now as it happens today
[17:57] my wife went on a trip i had to take her
[18:00] to the airport i was only able to
[18:02] capture two thousand dollars worth of
[18:04] movement
[18:05] in the s p e-mini
[18:07] that's the only thing i could capture
[18:09] when i got back
[18:10] i didn't participate in the afternoon
[18:12] and looking at it now
[18:14] i missed a really really huge
[18:16] opportunity there was no trading
[18:18] whatsoever in the afternoon my money was
[18:21] made short on e-mini s p
[18:23] in the morning session
[18:25] and that's all i had for today
[18:28] if i would have just held on to what i
[18:30] had in the morning you know i could have
[18:31] done around twelve thousand dollars
[18:33] today alone
[18:35] but i didn't hold on to it i had other
[18:37] things to take care of
[18:38] and that's that's the reality of things
[18:40] you know real life creeps in it's going
[18:42] to happen
[18:43] but
[18:44] for those of you that are trying to
[18:46] learn these concepts
[18:48] these types of movements
[18:50] are going to be very frustrating in the
[18:52] early stages of your development because
[18:54] you're going to feel like
[18:56] they're changing something they're aware
[18:58] of this it's this stuff goes on a lot it
[19:02] happens in the futures markets like
[19:04] commodities like corn soybeans
[19:06] gold
[19:07] oil
[19:08] um
[19:10] stocks
[19:11] sometimes the markets are just simply
[19:13] too heavy and they're not going to rally
[19:15] for you
[19:16] okay to short into
[19:18] it doesn't mean that they've changed
[19:19] anything it doesn't mean that the
[19:21] concepts don't work it just means that
[19:22] this is a market that is extremely
[19:24] bearish and when it's extremely bearish
[19:27] you have to trade it differently
[19:29] and
[19:30] i'll show you what i mean by that here
[19:32] and i'm not trying to inspire much
[19:34] outside of the mentorship but i know
[19:36] some of you have asked this in the
[19:38] comment section plus it helps my own
[19:40] personal group to understand this as
[19:42] well so it'll be a little bit of a
[19:44] refresher for them
[19:47] all right so here's the london open
[19:48] setup
[19:50] this was the move that set up
[19:52] the only real sound entry in my opinion
[19:55] that took place today
[19:56] here
[19:57] this displacement fair value gap
[20:00] rallies up bear shoulder block fair
[20:02] value gap runs into it and then you hold
[20:04] it because at the micro structure shift
[20:06] below the short term low the imbalance
[20:09] we went back up in this inbounds here
[20:11] remember when i taught you about this
[20:13] this one here
[20:14] can be traded two on a spike it can get
[20:17] up in there but your entry is on the
[20:19] lower fair value gap do you see the
[20:21] logic working here
[20:22] you are going to use a stop that's going
[20:25] to allow for the market trading up into
[20:26] this one so you may not like that much
[20:29] risk you may not be able to take this
[20:31] trade
[20:32] that's all part of this game but you can
[20:36] trade a micro
[20:38] or maybe you could i shouldn't say that
[20:39] you can i don't know what all of your
[20:42] your risk parameters are what you can
[20:45] work with in terms of margin but while
[20:48] you're learning in paper trading
[20:49] obviously you you can use anything
[20:51] because it's all hypothetical money
[20:54] and you're learning the skill set
[20:56] but the rules are still sticking to what
[20:58] i gave you in terms of the logic if you
[21:00] have two fair value gaps you're using
[21:01] this as the entry and you're using this
[21:03] as the risk
[21:06] don't always assume that you can get up
[21:07] here and get the best entry because it
[21:09] never went there see that
[21:11] so it's things like this this is what i
[21:13] refer to as a signature in price action
[21:16] these are algorithmic things that repeat
[21:19] but you have to have the discernment and
[21:22] experience and know when it's likely to
[21:24] occur when it isn't likely to occur
[21:27] so anyway let's talk a little bit about
[21:28] the 8 30 time period and 9 30.
[21:32] all right so here's 8 30. i've
[21:35] got the inbounds here after 8 30 now
[21:37] normally with the model i'm teaching you
[21:40] to look for something to the left prior
[21:42] to 8 30. some kind of short term high we
[21:44] want to see it rally up
[21:46] and using the opening price at 8 30
[21:48] which is here we want to see it rally
[21:50] above that run some stops then break
[21:52] down and create this type of scenario
[21:53] where it has displacement
[21:55] and a imbalance it rallies back up into
[21:58] the imbalance and sells off
[22:00] the model doesn't exist
[22:03] in today's price action on the
[22:04] five-minute chart
[22:05] it doesn't give it to you there okay so
[22:07] i'm going to give you
[22:09] coaching if you will to kind of like
[22:12] show you what was in price and some of
[22:14] the things i was looking at to help get
[22:16] in sync with the move
[22:18] but i didn't ride the whole thing out
[22:19] okay and
[22:21] believe me i'm looking at this today
[22:23] wishing i just would have had at least
[22:25] one of the two contracts i had on
[22:28] one still and just let it run and i
[22:30] could have done you know about eight
[22:31] grand or so
[22:33] but i didn't do it okay i was leaving i
[22:35] was taking my wife to the airport and
[22:37] it's just better
[22:38] if you're not going to be in front of
[22:40] the charts and anything can happen
[22:42] you have to get delayed out there
[22:44] phone doesn't connect with the you know
[22:46] the broker
[22:47] it's just better just to be away if
[22:49] you're not going to be paying attention
[22:50] to the marketplace
[22:52] just simply completely close the entire
[22:54] position also i'll throw this in here
[22:56] too uh
[22:57] shortly before i started doing the
[22:59] recording here
[23:00] i saw a question do i ever hold
[23:02] overnight in these current conditions i
[23:05] stopped holding overnight like 24 hours
[23:09] years ago we had a lot of things going
[23:12] on in the world that changed my
[23:14] trust
[23:15] just like i used to hold things over the
[23:17] weekend and expect continuation going
[23:20] into the opening on sunday and monday i
[23:22] no longer hold over the weekend so i am
[23:25] 100
[23:26] in a session
[23:28] or a day
[23:29] and out before the close like i'm not
[23:32] holding 24 hours i'm not holding 12
[23:34] hours you know i'm not doing those types
[23:36] of positions typically my trade is
[23:38] anywhere between 90 minutes to two hours
[23:41] maximum that's about the
[23:44] the length of time that i'm holding and
[23:47] i'm i'm looking to take mine and get out
[23:50] and then reassess things because there's
[23:52] just too much risk right now in the
[23:53] marketplace all asset classes
[23:56] and things are now starting to get a
[23:57] little wild and it could get a little
[24:00] bit more wilder
[24:02] okay
[24:03] but the five-minute chart has the
[24:05] imbalance in here we saw that run
[24:07] and
[24:09] the model i want to see it run above the
[24:11] opening price at 8 30.
[24:14] the opening price at 8 30 is the new
[24:16] york sessions
[24:17] opening price
[24:18] now don't get confused with the new york
[24:20] midnight candles opening price because
[24:23] the new york
[24:24] association in the name
[24:27] new york session
[24:29] is
[24:30] the 8 30 to 11 time period
[24:33] new york local time
[24:35] so i'm looking for this framework to
[24:38] offer power 3 which is a fractal element
[24:41] of
[24:42] accumulation manipulation and
[24:44] distribution that's what power three the
[24:46] three things that is empowering you is
[24:48] understanding those three elements
[24:50] accumulation what's accumulating short
[24:53] positions okay
[24:55] why because it's bearish so smart money
[24:57] would accumulate short positions then
[25:00] anticipate manipulation above the
[25:02] opening price they would assume more
[25:05] short positions there
[25:07] then
[25:09] it starts to go the other direction and
[25:11] they distribute
[25:12] their short positions
[25:14] at some important low that's that we're
[25:17] able to forecast then obviously it's
[25:19] relative to
[25:20] those
[25:22] daily equal lows and old daily lows and
[25:25] projections with the fib all those ideas
[25:27] come to mind in concert with in
[25:29] agreement as well
[25:30] with time of day okay so we're looking
[25:32] at a movement down into
[25:34] around the lunch hour beginning at noon
[25:37] okay creates the important low there we
[25:38] have a retracement during the lunch hour
[25:40] one more time it punches above the high
[25:42] here then it breaks down
[25:45] consolidate start street one two three
[25:47] and then you can expect continuation
[25:49] going into the afternoon session
[25:53] we're not gonna talk about the afternoon
[25:54] session because honestly i wasn't
[25:56] participating in it and it is what it is
[25:58] i'm familiar with this morning because i
[26:01] had some
[26:02] horses in the race today okay so we'll
[26:05] start getting a little bit more detail
[26:06] here here we have the
[26:09] four-minute chart
[26:10] the imbalance here this is one again
[26:13] that is not rallying above the opening
[26:15] price at 8 30. now it's showing 8.28
[26:19] but that's because i'm showing a four
[26:20] minute chart so don't let that confuse
[26:22] you but the opening price again never
[26:24] got traded above
[26:26] at the 830 candle so whatever that
[26:28] opening price is at 8 30 you extend that
[26:30] out in time and you want to see that
[26:32] rally above
[26:34] now
[26:35] when you have this
[26:37] expectation
[26:38] the other aspect of time
[26:41] is the 9 30 opening
[26:43] that's when the equity market or stocks
[26:46] themselves start trading their new york
[26:49] session
[26:50] so what happens at 9 30 what am i
[26:53] expecting at 9 30 well no number one 9
[26:55] 30 is just when the opening occurs and
[26:58] there's initial volatility now it can be
[27:01] whip saw where it can go up and down
[27:02] real short term
[27:04] and go both directions in a small range
[27:07] sometimes it could be a really large
[27:08] range and clear both sides of the buying
[27:11] cell
[27:12] and then
[27:15] whatever the real move is going to be
[27:16] for the day
[27:17] we wait for that to unfold
[27:19] today we can see at 9 30 it just starts
[27:22] to run lower
[27:24] it doesn't give us a rally at all so it
[27:26] just starts to speed up what's already
[27:28] in motion from three o'clock in the
[27:30] morning during the london open session
[27:34] so
[27:35] at 9 30 all it does is just start to
[27:37] accelerate down
[27:41] okay and the same ideas being shown on a
[27:43] three-minute chart
[27:45] you can see here that a little imbalance
[27:47] gets a little bit more refined trades up
[27:48] into it rather handsomely
[27:51] breaks down and here's another
[27:53] everybody got with a bearish order block
[27:55] now this is one in here where it's
[27:57] useful because
[27:59] you have a little bit more insight as to
[28:01] what it's doing it's too heavy it's not
[28:03] likely to rally
[28:05] there's no reason to look to go long
[28:07] start looking for reasons to get short
[28:09] and anytime you get an imbalance and
[28:12] we're above those relative equal lows on
[28:13] the daily chart because it's going to
[28:15] draw down into that that's the that's
[28:17] the heaviness
[28:19] objective okay why the prices keep going
[28:23] lower lower lower lower is because
[28:25] they're gravitating towards those
[28:27] relative equal lows on the daily chart
[28:30] okay so go back to the chart where i
[28:32] mentioned in this video and showed the
[28:33] daily chart i had that little blue line
[28:36] that's where price is being drawn to
[28:38] okay the algorithm is marching
[28:42] every minute every hour
[28:44] every day to that level
[28:46] how long does it take to get there i
[28:48] don't know that but i mentioned in my
[28:50] group
[28:52] that i didn't want to see it happen like
[28:54] we're seeing it right now
[28:55] because it's
[28:56] it's too fast and it doesn't give a lot
[28:58] of opportunities to get in with it and
[29:01] ride it so you either have to have
[29:03] entries like this
[29:05] which unfortunately isn't scalable
[29:08] with
[29:09] the model i've shared publicly but i do
[29:12] have obviously
[29:14] opportunities to go over it like this
[29:15] and show you that how you can still use
[29:18] the idea of the fair value you got to
[29:20] get in with it
[29:22] but you're going to have to leave out
[29:23] the element of
[29:24] a rally above the opening price at 8 30
[29:27] and 9 30 just creates a lot of
[29:29] volatility okay
[29:31] the initial surge in the new york
[29:34] session
[29:35] as the stocks
[29:38] begin to trade basically
[29:41] so
[29:42] as a recap here before i go into the
[29:44] next slide
[29:47] midnight
[29:48] new york time
[29:50] that opening price i used that to trade
[29:53] the london open session that's two
[29:54] o'clock to five o'clock in the morning
[29:56] and also to help frame the idea like say
[29:59] i sleep through london which is ninety
[30:01] percent of the time what i do today like
[30:03] i don't do a lot of london session
[30:04] trading and
[30:07] because of that when i wake up and i'm
[30:09] looking at the market around seven
[30:10] o'clock in the morning or so i'm looking
[30:12] at what has happened overnight and did
[30:14] we create a scenario that i would be
[30:16] looking to trade if i was awake during
[30:18] london
[30:19] if it happens then i know that i'm
[30:21] really built in
[30:23] with an advantage
[30:25] on the daily bias because if i'm bearish
[30:28] and it creates a rally above the opening
[30:29] price
[30:30] midnight time in new york
[30:32] and it creates that rally that little
[30:35] judas swing that explained many times
[30:37] already
[30:38] and it starts to decline and i'm below
[30:40] that around seven o'clock in the morning
[30:42] i know that i'm likely to create another
[30:44] little short term rally
[30:46] but it would be above ideally above the
[30:48] opening price at 8 30. but it may not do
[30:51] that
[30:52] and price just remained heavy below both
[30:55] opening prices at midnight new york
[30:57] local time
[30:58] and 8 30 new york local time
[31:01] so everything was extremely
[31:04] bearish and it was just so heavy it
[31:06] could not mount any meaningful rallies
[31:11] many times in my early development i got
[31:13] crushed on days like this where it felt
[31:16] like okay it's too
[31:18] too low now it can't just keep going
[31:20] lower so i'm going to try to buy it now
[31:24] because
[31:25] you know indicators told me they were
[31:26] oversold
[31:29] 1992 1993 1994
[31:32] i blew account after account after
[31:34] account doing that
[31:36] and it's frustrating
[31:40] now obviously with three decades of
[31:42] experience behind me i know what it's
[31:43] trying to do and where it's trying to
[31:45] get to
[31:46] and it's getting there in
[31:49] a really fast rate of speed
[31:51] now obviously you can get there a lot
[31:52] faster than that but i don't i don't
[31:54] want to do that because it gives no real
[31:57] opportunity for me to engage and
[31:58] participate in and it doesn't give you
[32:01] as the student to engage also with your
[32:03] demo or paper trading account to
[32:05] practice
[32:06] but as real life sometimes is
[32:09] it's unfair okay it doesn't give us what
[32:12] we want sometimes our expectations and
[32:14] our wants are
[32:16] denied
[32:18] and in today's climate that is not
[32:20] popular
[32:22] that's why this market and trading these
[32:24] markets is very very difficult
[32:27] especially for like the millennials okay
[32:32] that ideal
[32:33] perfect always come exactly as i
[32:35] expected
[32:37] sometimes is denied
[32:39] and either you
[32:41] accept that and navigate the markets
[32:45] within perfection
[32:47] and without the ideal scenario for your
[32:49] model
[32:51] or
[32:52] you're comfortable with just letting go
[32:54] and not doing anything and being
[32:57] accepting
[32:58] when it comes to big moves and you can't
[33:00] participate in it there's lots of moves
[33:02] folks over the last 30 years that i
[33:04] missed that were huge
[33:05] big huge moves
[33:07] for instance bitcoin i called that thing
[33:10] i called that thing at 7 500
[33:13] to 20 000.
[33:15] and then right before 20 000 i said it
[33:17] wasn't going to 20 000. it was 19 700.
[33:20] and i said it's going to go to 6 000.
[33:21] and everybody laughed and went down and
[33:23] i said i was going to go down 3 000 but
[33:24] it went down to like 32
[33:26] and then
[33:29] i think a couple times i i had it wrong
[33:32] publicly and then i said that we would
[33:35] go to 20 000.
[33:38] by christmas
[33:39] i think it was uh 2020
[33:42] and then i said thirty thousand modern
[33:43] years and i was off by about 18 hours
[33:47] it went to 30 000 on the second i
[33:48] believe it was on january
[33:50] 2021 and then i said 55 000
[33:54] and 66 000 that was about as far as i
[33:56] could see it go and we went just a
[33:58] little bit above 66 000
[34:00] and hasn't been doing much since
[34:03] but i didn't do anything with that with
[34:05] real money so i missed a huge run in
[34:08] something that would have otherwise
[34:09] paid out a lot of money
[34:12] and i've missed a lot of moves in the
[34:13] futures markets and a lot of commodities
[34:16] i missed a lot of stock moves you know
[34:18] while i was teaching forex there's a lot
[34:21] of stock movement and index futures that
[34:23] i didn't participate in
[34:25] guess what
[34:26] it's okay
[34:28] i'm able to still find trades
[34:31] i'm not starving
[34:33] and that's the the reality you're going
[34:35] to have to come to terms and
[34:37] the grip
[34:38] with
[34:40] you have no way of participating in
[34:42] every single move
[34:44] and don't think that you're going to
[34:45] find every big move you're not going to
[34:47] participate in every single price swing
[34:49] you're not going to folks
[34:51] i miss moves you're going to miss moves
[34:53] and it's okay it's part of this game
[34:56] this business is going to still run and
[34:58] do the same things we're looking for all
[34:59] the time and you're not going to
[35:01] participate in every move
[35:03] okay so give yourself
[35:05] the
[35:06] permission okay
[35:08] to be human
[35:09] you're going to do it wrong sometimes
[35:12] you're going to see it for something
[35:14] it's not and you're gonna miss that big
[35:16] move
[35:18] i had a little piece of this today but i
[35:20] didn't get the whole thing
[35:22] i wish i would have but i didn't
[35:25] and it's okay i forgive myself for being
[35:27] a good husband taking my wife to the
[35:28] airport i know this is all too much
[35:30] stuff and you don't care some of you
[35:31] like to say those things in the comments
[35:33] get to the point the point is
[35:35] you do this
[35:37] you're going to have these elements
[35:38] creep in and how are you going to deal
[35:40] with it you're going to get mad and go
[35:41] on the social media
[35:43] you know blurry out and curse and say
[35:45] these markets suck
[35:47] no that's not what you should be doing
[35:49] you should just reason with yourself
[35:51] ahead of time say okay i'm not going to
[35:53] be able to do everything
[35:55] i'm not going to participate in every
[35:56] single move and this is what happens
[35:59] sometimes
[36:00] it doesn't mean the model is broken i
[36:02] promise you
[36:03] and over the next couple weeks you're
[36:04] gonna see the model delivering like it's
[36:07] done in the past
[36:08] and it's fine
[36:10] it's gonna there's gonna be times when
[36:11] the market shifts in and out
[36:13] and the market structure is just too
[36:15] overwhelmingly bullish or too
[36:17] overwhelmingly bearish in this instance
[36:21] you know the bearishness i gave you guys
[36:23] just was a lot more bearish than the
[36:25] model would permit for entry but you can
[36:28] see there's fair value gaps in here you
[36:29] can use to participate dropping down to
[36:31] two minute chart let's see again refined
[36:33] in real nice here
[36:35] and then once more in here
[36:38] and then
[36:39] drop down into that noon time creating
[36:41] an important low
[36:43] which is what i taught you
[36:45] in this mentorship already and that two
[36:47] minute imbalance you can see on one
[36:49] minutes right here
[36:51] and here
[36:52] really nice delivery there
[36:54] and these are just simple little
[36:56] imbalances to get in sync with what is
[36:58] already in motion
[37:00] not needing to see it rally above the
[37:02] 830 opening price because
[37:04] it's not likely to
[37:06] so it takes a little bit of courage to
[37:09] get in here and trade these types of
[37:10] setups
[37:12] but that's what you do or you don't do
[37:14] anything
[37:15] and you just tape read you watch it when
[37:17] it doesn't it's okay i would like to see
[37:19] it drop here
[37:20] and into the drop yes and you study that
[37:23] and give you another fair value gap in
[37:25] here that's not highlighted and it
[37:26] rallies up to a fair shoulder block and
[37:28] sells off and your stop is above here
[37:30] and just because it goes down lower
[37:33] it doesn't mean jam your stop loss to
[37:35] here because that's what happens
[37:37] you need to have time
[37:40] and price behind you before you start
[37:42] moving your stop loss
[37:45] and ultimately trades obviously lower
[37:47] into that noon time all right so i think
[37:49] that's going to be it
[37:51] uh the next
[37:53] episode on thursday i'm going to show
[37:55] you a couple things inside the trading
[37:57] platform on tradingview
[37:59] that i think are useful
[38:01] it that answers a few things and one of
[38:04] those students made mention that
[38:07] could i literally go in and show how to
[38:10] set up the fibonacci
[38:12] so i thought it was kind of simple
[38:14] already but
[38:16] obviously some of you are really really
[38:17] new and you're not familiar with the
[38:19] tradingview platform so i'm going to add
[38:21] that at the end of the video on thursday
[38:23] coming up okay so that way it's at the
[38:25] end and anybody that already knows how
[38:27] to do it they don't have to go through
[38:28] and watch all that stuff but i'll give
[38:29] you another teaching and lesson
[38:31] obviously on thursday
[38:33] and until i talk to you then
[38:35] be safe
