[00:05] all right so we're gonna be doing a
[00:07] quick little ditty on institutional
[00:09] order flow
[00:11] i'm gonna be trading against daily bias
[00:19] okay and going along here and it's on
[00:21] the basis of
[00:23] the cell stops or cell side like already
[00:25] being taken we've already traded into a
[00:26] fair value gap around that 4 000 level
[00:31] and i'm
[00:32] treating with the idea that it could run
[00:34] up here and take out the buy stops
[00:36] above the high of the day
[00:38] it doesn't need to do that
[00:41] to be profitable
[00:43] so my draw liquidity is here
[00:50] and
[00:57] noting the buy side liquidity will
[01:01] take in
[01:05] clear
[01:06] profitable shorts
[01:14] all right
[01:15] so this is kind of like the
[01:18] the idea okay the draw on liquidity
[01:22] now it doesn't need the trade here to be
[01:24] profitable that's just my best case
[01:26] scenario
[01:28] so what i want to do now is draw the
[01:31] buy side and sell side liquidity pools
[01:34] and i'll show you the framework
[01:39] for the logic of why i'm entering where
[01:41] i'm entering it
[01:42] and i want you to take a look at the
[01:44] chart first and see if you understand
[01:46] what i'm
[01:47] capitalizing on
[01:53] pause the video
[02:00] all right
[02:02] this here
[02:04] is the sell side liquidity
[02:08] so the market has dropped below those
[02:10] relative equal lows i bought those cell
[02:12] stops
[02:14] so cell side is taken
[02:20] okay so you can see that here
[02:22] and now what i'm going to target
[02:24] even though i think it could go but it
[02:27] may not really get there it can go to 40
[02:29] 51 and take out the high of the day but
[02:32] let's say i'm wrong
[02:34] what am i going to aim for this is what
[02:36] i'm going to take the bulk of my
[02:37] position off
[02:39] at
[02:40] and i got to make this
[02:43] show on top of the line
[02:55] okay
[02:56] and put it on top
[03:00] all right so i'm reaching for that
[03:02] now the bulk of my position i'm going to
[03:04] try to pyramid
[03:05] and build this this is a little bit
[03:07] bigger than just the four
[03:08] contracts but we'll see what i get
[03:15] now try not to worry about that profit
[03:17] and loss
[03:19] that's that's the distraction
[03:22] pay attention to the price
[03:26] so we dipped inside that fair value gap
[03:30] just to the left of us
[03:32] and we went below to take out the
[03:34] relative equal lows that's noted here
[03:35] for the south side liquidity
[03:37] being taken
[03:40] so i'm looking for expansion to the
[03:41] upside
[03:43] retail sees that as a bear flag
[03:45] okay so they're thinking lower prices
[03:48] i'm not
[03:51] even if i'm wrong about it not going to
[03:52] 4051 i'm confident that we're going to
[03:54] go up into
[03:57] the buy side liquidity that's needed in
[04:00] blue
[04:02] okay so far price looks
[04:04] nice it's respecting
[04:06] the unbind narrative i'm acting upon
[04:14] now i want you to also monitor how i
[04:16] manage my stop loss
[04:19] even though i'm trading against the
[04:21] daily bias
[04:22] the fact that we traded down three times
[04:24] intraday
[04:26] and took out yesterday's low
[04:28] by doing so uh
[04:30] that lack of follow-through
[04:33] kind of like bolsters i'm gonna do two
[04:35] more
[04:40] here trading on to the order block
[04:47] okay so now i have six contracts long
[04:49] and i'll move my stop up just a little
[04:51] bit
[04:52] underneath that low right there it
[04:54] should not trade back down into that if
[04:57] it does i'm wrong and that's fine
[05:00] why do i feel confident about placing my
[05:01] stop loss there because if you look
[05:03] where i have my stop it's basically
[05:05] inside of
[05:06] the lower end of that fair value gap and
[05:08] the old short term high around 9 30. so
[05:12] i have market structure supporting the
[05:13] idea
[05:14] and
[05:15] we've already taken cell side liquidity
[05:16] out we're back inside the range
[05:19] between where my stop loss order is and
[05:22] the short term high i have noted for buy
[05:24] side liquidity
[05:26] so bicep liquidity is the next draw on
[05:28] liquidity i'll take four of the
[05:30] contracts off
[05:31] so
[05:33] i'm going to annotate what we're doing
[05:34] here we're just bumping the order block
[05:37] there
[05:38] straighten this line out here
[05:41] okay hold down shift when you're
[05:43] dragging your trend lines and treating
[05:45] view it'll automatically straighten them
[05:46] out
[05:48] and that is an order block
[05:52] bullish order block is what i'm
[05:53] annotating here
[05:55] so you can see this is all
[05:58] being done as it happens
[06:02] i can shoot bubble gun
[06:04] and walk at the same time
[06:07] all right and
[06:10] that's what i'm looking for i'm looking
[06:11] for that type of movement
[06:15] so that way we understand what i'm
[06:17] internalizing
[06:19] what am i seeing what's likely to pan
[06:21] out that's what i want
[06:23] so now i'm going to study see if price
[06:24] does in fact deliver
[06:27] with that premise in mind
[06:29] again if i'm lucky it could expand up
[06:31] into that 40 51 in the quarter but i
[06:34] don't need it to because the bulk of the
[06:36] position which is now six contracts i'm
[06:38] going to take four off above that buy
[06:40] side liquidity
[06:42] should i get the opportunity to do so
[06:43] and i'll do it on the basis of a market
[06:45] order
[06:48] all right so far we're getting some
[06:50] response off that order block
[06:52] level i've annotated
[06:58] ocd is
[07:00] flaring i like things the way i like
[07:03] them folks
[07:04] all right nice little caffeine bar there
[07:07] caffeine bar is something i named
[07:10] big
[07:11] green candles
[07:13] if i'm bullish i want to see that i'm
[07:16] embarrassing i see it i don't like it
[07:30] so i'm just being a little facetious
[07:32] here
[07:33] you don't see
[07:34] that type of stuff called before it
[07:36] happens that precise
[07:39] but it's okay i'm gonna give you
[07:43] some more evidence here today
[07:51] now this is what you want to do also if
[07:52] you're practicing reading order flow
[07:55] tape reading
[07:57] you don't have to necessarily put a demo
[07:58] account position on i'm doing it just
[08:01] simply because a lot of people like to
[08:02] see it
[08:06] okay this is me just making sure you
[08:08] understand that i see this before it
[08:09] happens
[08:13] not speaking in
[08:15] waffles where it's hard to tell what i'm
[08:18] saying what i'm expecting it's very very
[08:20] specific
[08:22] nothing ambiguous is being hinted at in
[08:24] here
[08:28] okay so cell side has been taken this is
[08:30] now being dimmed so that way the focus
[08:33] is on the
[08:34] the levels that are more pronounced in
[08:37] color
[08:40] now see there's two down closed candles
[08:43] the higher candle
[08:45] of the two
[08:46] i'm going to draw an older block on
[08:50] it can drop down into that pick up
[08:52] momentum from there and then the
[08:54] algorithm will likely reprice
[08:57] higher to the bicep liquidity
[09:00] or around that 40 36 level
[09:04] so i'm allowing for and preparing myself
[09:06] should it trade down into that level
[09:10] it might just touch the higher wick of
[09:12] the two down closed candles i'm
[09:14] anchoring to i'm using the uppermost
[09:17] opening price as
[09:19] kind of like the level i'm looking for
[09:21] but
[09:22] that small little wick
[09:24] high
[09:26] it might just touch that and be enough
[09:28] or may not even touch it at all
[09:31] but when you're watching order let me
[09:32] make this a little bit more thicker so
[09:34] you can see it
[09:36] be able to track what price is doing
[09:41] now this is one of those instances where
[09:46] you're looking for price to
[09:49] kind of like
[09:50] drive higher you want to do it in like
[09:54] big candles speed
[09:57] delivery right to where you're looking
[09:58] for
[09:59] traders are now trying to go short
[10:00] because
[10:01] they looked at that imbalance the 8 30
[10:04] the quick sudden drop the market has
[10:06] come back and rebalanced that now it's
[10:08] starting to drift lower people that
[10:10] follow imbalances and things like that
[10:11] because they've gotten real popular
[10:13] lately
[10:14] that
[10:15] idea they're trying to sell short on i'm
[10:18] going against that and i'm targeting
[10:20] them okay so that's a that's a buy right
[10:22] there
[10:26] some
[10:28] order block right there
[10:31] all right i would adjust that line but
[10:34] i've already outlined what i'm saying
[10:36] here it's basically touched the
[10:39] little wick
[10:41] so if i wanted to add one more which i
[10:44] guess i could i could buy one here just
[10:46] to prove the point but
[10:48] it is what it is let's assume that this
[10:50] is all we're going to build on
[10:52] i want to see it rally higher from here
[10:55] notice i'm not in a hurry to rush my
[10:57] stop-loss up
[11:02] very nice price delivery there so think
[11:05] about what's being shown here the down
[11:07] close candles are supporting price
[11:10] we're seeing expansion
[11:12] and
[11:14] where is the bull's-eye
[11:18] get ready turn 50 my eyes are not what
[11:19] they used to be folks
[11:22] i'm sure if it was a rattlesnake i'd be
[11:24] bit by now
[11:29] uh there it is i should have checked my
[11:31] most recent ones at the top
[11:33] all right so we'll put that right here
[11:35] that's our bullseye okay
[11:43] and i can bring my stop-loss up to break
[11:45] even i'm actually going to get that a
[11:47] little bit higher
[11:49] now you can see the profit and loss for
[11:51] these guys that like to see those
[11:53] numbers flashing
[11:57] all right so i'm going to take four off
[11:58] when it runs above that high and then
[12:00] i'll
[12:02] consider moving my stop up and see if i
[12:03] can get lucky the rest of the day i have
[12:04] things i have to take care of
[12:06] administrative things and
[12:08] video production so should we get this
[12:10] run up
[12:12] above i'm going to close four at market
[12:19] okay just sitting here waiting for it to
[12:21] deliver
[12:24] and again those odor blocks were drawn
[12:26] real time you saw it happen i've
[12:29] outlined it gave you the logic
[12:31] and we'll see if we can get
[12:33] some magic
[12:35] there we go
[12:43] so i'm going to
[12:48] show you the executions here
[12:51] and we can see the
[12:53] the business
[12:56] okay and
[12:59] i'll leave it up to the market to decide
[13:00] whether or not it wants to go up here
[13:02] and take the 40 51 and a quarter level
[13:04] it doesn't need to at this point i've
[13:06] booked over five hypothetical thousand
[13:08] dollars in
[13:09] this example here reading order flop
[13:12] and that will be it for this one i
[13:14] believe
[13:15] and i'll just change this color here
[13:18] because now it's been fulfilled
[13:24] and my typical
[13:28] sarcastic ribbing
[13:32] gotta be me
[13:37] so here is the final here is the buying
[13:41] four
[13:42] four thousand six and a quart and a half
[13:45] and then buying this here
[13:48] so the initial was buying the fair value
[13:50] gap sales ops then the order block then
[13:53] selling four above
[13:55] here
[13:56] and i moved the stop loss up
[13:59] and it tripped me out right there on the
[14:01] final two
[14:02] so hopefully you found this insightful
[14:05] until next time
[14:07] be safe
