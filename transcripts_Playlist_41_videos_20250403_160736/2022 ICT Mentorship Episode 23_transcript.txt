[00:06] all right folks
[00:07] and take a look at the e-mini
[00:10] micro
[00:11] nasdaq 100 index
[00:14] and i'll show you the imbalance we're in
[00:16] here this is the initial one
[00:18] you can always imagine
[00:19] it could stab up into the second one
[00:21] which it's
[00:22] really a sense it's just done now
[00:24] so that could be a cell
[00:25] i'd like to see it come down here first
[00:28] now outline this as i go
[00:31] this is kind of like the end of the road
[00:34] for
[00:35] the drop down before it runs tuesday's
[00:37] highs that's what i'm thinking this is
[00:38] fomc
[00:39] i'm waited a few minutes for it to do
[00:42] its initial shakeout
[00:45] so this is the end of the race lower
[00:47] that's the little checkered flag here
[00:48] notice i have that so it's not like
[00:51] me talking
[00:53] after the fact you can see i'm doing
[00:55] everything here
[00:57] there's where we're looking for it to
[00:59] drop down in
[01:00] and run out the tuesday highs that i was
[01:03] mentioning on
[01:04] my community post
[01:06] so we're looking for the trade down in
[01:08] there now it could sweep
[01:10] a little bit below that because
[01:12] to the left of that imbalance that i'm
[01:14] highlighting in
[01:15] turquoise
[01:17] there's a cell side of the pretty pool
[01:18] resting
[01:19] just below it but
[01:20] for now i'm just focusing there so it
[01:22] could drop down
[01:24] into that level now there's a couple
[01:26] ways to use this information you can do
[01:29] a trade here with your demo account
[01:32] compliance reasons
[01:34] and
[01:35] look for it to run out the short term
[01:36] low
[01:38] and or
[01:40] wait for it to
[01:42] potentially trade up into the higher
[01:43] time frame
[01:45] fair value gap
[01:46] and the reason why you could potentially
[01:48] wait for that is because it's fomc it
[01:50] has like a
[01:51] knee-jerk reaction kind of like non-farm
[01:53] payroll there's a initial leg then
[01:56] another leg then
[01:57] like a fake out leg and then a real
[01:59] setup comes which is what i'm outlining
[02:01] here in that blue shaded area
[02:04] so i'm noticing
[02:06] that it's likely to draw down here so
[02:08] i'm drawing this outside we can see the
[02:10] diagram is dropping okay
[02:13] the idea is to drop down here first is
[02:15] the quick move i'm looking for
[02:17] then the run through tuesday's high
[02:25] all right so it should start dropping in
[02:27] here
[02:29] i don't want to see it go too much more
[02:31] than that because
[02:32] that would upset the fair value you got
[02:34] that is
[02:35] not yet traded into i think that's going
[02:38] to be the
[02:39] the next real drop
[02:42] so right here's where i'm thinking
[02:43] initially there's cell side resting
[02:45] right below that low so you could be a
[02:47] short here
[02:52] and your stop would be right above that
[02:54] most recent green candle to the left of
[02:56] where we're right now
[02:58] and you can see there's no replay button
[03:00] being used here the candles are painting
[03:01] the replay button is dim it's not even
[03:06] a thing with me
[03:07] that's not true now is it i did recently
[03:09] in the mentorship video use the replay
[03:11] button but i felt awkward and i just
[03:13] wanted to do it just to be funny
[03:16] so here is the
[03:17] drop down in here
[03:19] now i can revisit the bottom and under
[03:20] that
[03:21] fair value gap and bump it kind of like
[03:23] a support resistance idea
[03:25] and that would be a shorting opportunity
[03:27] if it were to do that
[03:30] and again this thought would be placed
[03:31] at the high
[03:32] of the most recent green candle to the
[03:35] left
[03:44] right there see that
[03:46] that's a short right there
[03:53] okay the market is
[03:57] likely to keep dropping in here i'm
[03:58] looking for that little bullseye that
[04:00] blew bull's-eye right below that
[04:01] short-term low
[04:03] and that blue line if you notice when i
[04:04] first started the recording here that
[04:06] was really just an order block
[04:09] so it could bounce there
[04:12] a little bit
[04:15] but ultimately my interest is
[04:17] from where we are now down into that
[04:20] checkered flag area
[04:23] and it doesn't look like i got enough
[04:25] room so i'm
[04:26] gonna probably have to move that over to
[04:29] the right a little bit
[04:30] and again
[04:32] the mindset is we're dropping down
[04:34] okay even though it's it really
[04:36] initially just ran the tuesday high but
[04:38] it's done shallow
[04:40] okay the vocabulary i'm using here is
[04:44] running
[04:45] the tuesday high
[04:46] not sweeping
[04:48] the tuesday high
[04:50] the difference between sweeping would be
[04:52] like what it's done here that will be a
[04:53] sweep that's a real shallow little run
[04:55] above that red line that's tuesday's
[04:57] high okay so it swept that and we're
[05:00] coming back down
[05:02] post fomc so kind of like look at this
[05:05] move here we're making and if it can
[05:07] drop down to that blue shaded area it
[05:09] might just if i'm wrong it might just go
[05:11] down to that little bull's eye and then
[05:13] run higher from there i'm hoping it
[05:15] doesn't do that i want to see it trade
[05:16] down into that blue shaded area a little
[05:18] checkered flag is because that's like
[05:19] the end of the race for bears
[05:21] they get into that
[05:23] then it should start the real move
[05:25] higher running
[05:26] tuesday high
[05:28] running tuesday's high means it runs
[05:29] right over top of it and it just doesn't
[05:30] look back
[05:32] sweeping is where it just goes above or
[05:33] below a low or high you know i mean like
[05:36] if we're going to sweep by side that
[05:38] means it's going to go up a little bit
[05:39] and then go down and reverse
[05:41] okay
[05:42] if i'm saying we're going to run an old
[05:44] high
[05:45] for relative equal highs that means
[05:46] we're going to run through it and
[05:48] continue
[05:52] so that way there's a little bit of an
[05:53] understanding here what i'm saying when
[05:54] i say that
[05:55] i try to pick my words carefully so that
[05:57] way you understand the distinction
[05:58] between
[05:59] what i'm expecting as a sweep and
[06:01] reverse back into the range or expansion
[06:04] move where
[06:06] i think if we can get down here and i'm
[06:07] going to scrub this over because you can
[06:09] see we're getting running out of space
[06:11] here it might take a little bit more
[06:12] candles
[06:13] than i first
[06:15] thought
[06:16] oh let me get this back here
[06:20] there we are oh there it is
[06:22] this thing i'm telling you
[06:25] i look like a noob
[06:26] i see these are new
[06:28] all right so
[06:31] we'll see if we can drop down into that
[06:35] and i had to make another video
[06:38] for my mentorship group so i got to get
[06:40] started on that one
[06:42] so
[06:43] here's a bearish order block it can come
[06:44] back and hit that and
[06:46] resume going lower
[06:51] all right
[06:52] not bad not bad
[06:55] let's see if she loves me
[07:01] you can see no replay button
[07:04] everything's dynamic here
[07:14] all right about to run into that
[07:16] cell side liquidity pool
[07:23] just anchor this here so we can see
[07:25] visually when it drops below it
[07:28] change the color here's a little bit
[07:31] lighter than that one
[07:35] oops too light
[07:37] okay that's good enough that way you can
[07:39] see it i'll take this off here
[07:43] all right
[07:45] and there you go
[07:48] now i'll come back to this in a moment
[07:54] all right as you can see the market did
[07:56] in fact trade down look at the bodies of
[07:57] the candles respecting that blue shaded
[07:59] area really really handsome price
[08:01] delivery
[08:02] and it dipped down a little bit below
[08:04] but that's fine i'm not worried about
[08:06] being that accurate the main thing is
[08:07] going down into that area it turns
[08:10] and then runs tuesday's high look how
[08:11] much more dynamic that is
[08:13] now
[08:15] what i did was i took the low
[08:17] at
[08:18] the turn after it made it to run into
[08:20] that little blue shaded area once it
[08:22] started rallying and it took out the
[08:24] swing high around that thirteen thousand
[08:27] six
[08:28] i'm sorry thirteen thousand one fifty
[08:31] basically crossed back over where the
[08:32] fair value gap is the larger one that
[08:34] drop down into
[08:35] once it trades above that then i'm gonna
[08:37] use the high initially at the 2 o'clock
[08:40] hour down to the low
[08:41] post
[08:43] 230 that range i'm using the fibonacci
[08:46] to
[08:46] expand up to a target and it came up to
[08:49] 13437 even
[08:51] i'm just waiting for it to hit that and
[08:53] once it does then i'll go into
[08:55] the
[08:57] fibonacci and i'll show you you know
[08:58] what this looked like how i measured it
[09:00] and all that
[09:02] but hopefully you can see that it's
[09:05] done the majority of the move which was
[09:08] outlined on the community tab before i
[09:10] obviously did the video
[09:13] i did the video here
[09:14] you know marking it up that we can see
[09:16] it wasn't a replay thing it wasn't
[09:18] something after the fact
[09:20] it's something that i'm teaching you all
[09:22] here now the question mark at the bottom
[09:24] lower left hand corner
[09:27] what that is anchoring is the high that
[09:28] was formed
[09:30] at two o'clock or what would be shown is
[09:32] 1400 here on the chart
[09:34] down to that low where the question mark
[09:36] is so what you're doing is you're going
[09:37] to get measurement of the range okay
[09:39] where's 50 of that
[09:41] below 50 is where that fair value gap is
[09:44] that's in turquoise
[09:46] so that's the target it's dropping down
[09:47] into it so it's a matter of looking at
[09:49] this
[09:50] and really there's technically
[09:53] oh there's one
[09:55] two
[09:56] three
[09:58] four
[09:59] five
[10:00] six
[10:02] seven eight
[10:04] there's eight trades in this
[10:07] this whole entire thing so
[10:09] um once it trades this level here
[10:12] i'm looking forward to hit that and then
[10:14] i'll go in and kind of show you some
[10:16] things about what i'm referring to that
[10:18] as the eight setups
[10:20] and this might not be the real setup
[10:22] that you would be looking for it might
[10:23] be something one of the eight that i'll
[10:25] show you
[10:26] but that's the unique
[10:29] idea that i want you to adopt as a
[10:30] student of mine i don't want you all
[10:32] thinking well we all have to have the
[10:33] same setup no you don't have to have the
[10:35] same setup in fact you're not
[10:37] you're going to come to the conclusion
[10:38] that
[10:39] you know the things that you're looking
[10:40] for
[10:41] are going to be much more important
[10:44] when it's uniquely
[10:46] selected not me pushing you into a mode
[10:49] saying this is how it's going to work
[10:50] every single time just for you because
[10:53] it's not going to work that way
[10:54] so you have to find a way to
[10:57] grow comfortable with the concepts and
[11:00] how that applies to the present market
[11:02] conditions
[11:03] and how you select your setup
[11:05] and i'll show you eight of them in here
[11:06] that way you'll know that this is what
[11:08] you're looking for
[11:10] and it fits your criteria and you may
[11:12] not take any of the other seven
[11:15] out of the eight
[11:16] but the main one here is obviously the
[11:18] one i highlighted it's the one that is
[11:20] the highest form of analysis that we can
[11:22] see
[11:23] exactly where it's going to draw to
[11:24] before it turns around so you can couple
[11:26] what i've shown you here with what i've
[11:28] out outright came and
[11:30] told you basically that i'm looking for
[11:32] the drop down at fomc at two o'clock
[11:34] once it drops down into that usually
[11:36] around
[11:37] 2 30 it
[11:39] finished its initial leg where it prices
[11:41] in whatever it's going to do either high
[11:43] or low and then starts to rally so you
[11:45] can see it's pretty much close to that
[11:47] in terms of algorithmic delivery
[11:49] just a little bit past 2 30.
[11:52] we're about ready to hit that target
[11:53] here and there she is all right so let's
[11:57] dim that out and i'll take you over to
[11:58] the fib portion and i'll explain
[12:00] everything to you that way
[12:02] all right so now obviously
[12:04] i'm going to take you back in
[12:06] i'm going to use the fib here and what
[12:08] i'm doing is anchoring it to the
[12:11] high
[12:13] down to the low now this is the most
[12:14] extreme
[12:15] now usually i'll use the highest open or
[12:18] close and the lowest opener close in the
[12:21] price swing when it's not expected to
[12:23] have a whole lot of volatility because
[12:25] it's
[12:26] the fomc
[12:27] it's more likely to be much more
[12:29] volatile that means the extreme of the
[12:32] ranges should be considered that means
[12:34] now i'm going to use the wix you get
[12:35] asked a lot all the time you know
[12:37] in the comments like you know why does
[12:38] itc use the wix and why does he use the
[12:40] bodies and what does he differentiate i
[12:42] just taught you okay so
[12:45] i'll show you two
[12:47] forms of that
[12:48] and actually i'm gonna do this backwards
[12:50] didn't i yep i did
[12:53] i'm going to draw it from the
[12:55] low
[12:56] up to the high i'm looking for upside
[12:58] objectives okay so
[13:00] low up to high here's one objective
[13:03] here's two objectives
[13:05] and now
[13:06] we're just falling short of that one
[13:08] okay so that's kind of the extreme
[13:09] target for me today
[13:11] but if you look at the
[13:13] body to body it'll make a whole lot more
[13:16] sense in a moment
[13:17] there's that target i was looking for
[13:21] right there
[13:23] in the earlier portion of the recording
[13:25] okay
[13:27] very very gap initial one here drops
[13:29] down hits the order block which is that
[13:31] blue line here it bounced up into the
[13:33] fair value got this is what i was
[13:35] suggesting this is going to be the mean
[13:37] one so let's see
[13:38] run on liquidity drop down
[13:42] start to drop even lower hit an order
[13:43] block
[13:45] then rallies up hits the fair value gap
[13:47] that sets the stage for the decline down
[13:49] into the area i highlighted in advance
[13:52] said this was the end of the road for
[13:53] the bears
[13:54] it starts to rally comes back down in
[13:57] rallies once more
[13:59] takes off takes out tuesday's high much
[14:01] more meaningfully
[14:02] and rallies again
[14:04] pulls back into an imbalance here
[14:05] rallies again
[14:07] pulls back into an imbalance here after
[14:09] taking our target and even continues to
[14:11] go higher from there okay so let's take
[14:13] a look at some of the trades you got
[14:16] the run here
[14:19] ahead of fomc that i would not count
[14:22] okay
[14:23] that's that's a setup but that's a
[14:25] gambler's setup before the fomc
[14:27] announcement
[14:29] so we have the drop down
[14:31] then the fair value gap here so that's
[14:33] trade one
[14:34] the return back to the fair bag up here
[14:36] that's tree two
[14:38] drops down in
[14:39] below here you would close your short if
[14:41] it's a scalp
[14:43] here is a long idea as a scalp to take
[14:45] us up into i said look what you're
[14:47] resting above this high here
[14:49] and then into the fair value that says
[14:51] the short down into the objective i was
[14:52] looking for now right away some of you
[14:54] are thinking man i'm not spiderman
[14:57] how do you expect me to take all these
[14:58] trades i'm not folks i'm not any one of
[15:00] these things that i'm outlining here
[15:02] could be a specific setup that fits your
[15:05] unique model okay that meets the
[15:08] criteria that you're looking for
[15:10] then it drops down here that's a buy and
[15:13] you can share this here as an order
[15:15] block there
[15:16] rallies up and it comes back down into
[15:17] the order block these two down closed
[15:19] candles here because now this is where i
[15:21] said we were going to turn
[15:23] and i said that we're going to run
[15:24] tuesday's highs
[15:25] now sweep them like this
[15:27] it's going to run them okay so we ran
[15:29] right over top of them here so it
[15:31] rallies up comes back down in
[15:33] retracement rallies again small little
[15:36] imbalance you can be a buyer there
[15:38] rallies
[15:39] and again here
[15:40] this is one that i
[15:42] didn't obviously mention or you see
[15:44] because i stopped recording as it ran
[15:46] through here on our objective okay
[15:49] and i think that is going to be it so i
[15:51] i don't want you thinking this is an
[15:54] invitation for you to try to trade fomc
[15:56] or like a non-farm payroll event
[15:59] they're very very risky extremely risky
[16:02] but they're really fun to go back into
[16:04] and study from a hindsight perspective
[16:06] or if you can watch it live
[16:07] it's a wonderful case study that we can
[16:10] look at how liquidity is taken how it
[16:13] runs to the other extreme of the range
[16:15] and how it starts to deliver
[16:17] institutional order flow
[16:18] all down close candles should be
[16:20] supporting price as it goes up and
[16:22] running out to stays high in a much more
[16:24] meaningful manner
[16:26] hopefully you found this one insightful
[16:27] until next time be safe
[16:41] you
