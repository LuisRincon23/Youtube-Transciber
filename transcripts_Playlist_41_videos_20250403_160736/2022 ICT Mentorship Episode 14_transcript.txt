[00:01] all right so i'm going to do a execution
[00:04] i got requested to show how i
[00:06] use this model
[00:08] here you got there we had a market
[00:10] structure shift to the upside i'm
[00:11] looking for a gap fill
[00:13] from friday's close
[00:16] so i'm going to go long here
[00:18] 12 micros
[00:21] of the mini nasdaq
[00:23] or i'm sorry micro nasdaq futures
[00:26] contract
[00:27] so i'm going to
[00:30] look for price to drop down into that
[00:33] fair value gap
[00:35] and look for a run above fourteen
[00:38] thousand one sixty
[00:40] right now i have my initial interest at
[00:42] fourteen thousand one eighty
[00:44] i'm thinking fourteen thousand two
[00:47] twenty
[00:48] is possible today there's my limit entry
[00:55] okay and i'll show you where we're at
[01:01] so there's the
[01:03] closure of the fair value gap
[01:05] now i'm watching price i'm going to see
[01:06] it start expanding on the upside
[01:09] i'm not watching the number underneath
[01:11] that profit okay that's not what i'm
[01:13] watching i'm watching the candles
[01:16] is it constantly going towards
[01:18] that small little fair value gap around
[01:21] fourteen thousand one
[01:23] twenty two
[01:24] fourteen thousand one
[01:26] thirty eight or so
[01:28] i wanna see it go through that
[01:31] now they can start to consolidate in
[01:33] that area
[01:34] and reaccumulate for new longs kind of
[01:37] like a pausing maybe like think like a
[01:39] bowl flag that's kind of like what i
[01:40] anticipate forming between
[01:42] 14 1 20 14
[01:44] [Music]
[01:46] 140 in that area
[01:48] similar to what we just watched right
[01:49] there so far the expansion on the upside
[01:51] solid it looks good
[01:57] i'm thinking i might take the limit
[01:58] order up to
[02:00] 14220 but we'll see how we trade above
[02:02] the short term high
[02:04] made prior to 10 o'clock in the morning
[02:07] little run above new equity high
[02:14] nice placement on the entry that's
[02:16] probably random
[02:20] all right by side sitting right around
[02:22] that
[02:23] 14160 level that's in the crosshairs
[02:25] right now
[02:26] typically you'll see it usually
[02:28] consolidate around here maybe small
[02:29] little retracement gets everybody
[02:31] thinking it's time to sell short
[02:33] remember resistance ideas from retail
[02:36] are going to see that 160 and say okay
[02:38] i'm gonna
[02:38] get short because it went down from
[02:40] there the last time so i'm not thinking
[02:41] that i'm thinking it's gonna like swat
[02:43] bust through the door
[02:45] and run up into that 14 180 i might
[02:48] adjust that in here
[02:50] okay so
[02:51] that's kind of like my best case
[02:53] scenario and this is what i'm going to
[02:55] try to take six contracts off above here
[03:01] so
[03:02] i'm thinking if it runs there i'll take
[03:04] six off to fund the position
[03:07] roll the stops to even
[03:09] and then see if i can get that limit
[03:11] order at fourteen thousand two twenty
[03:15] smaller consolidation around that fair
[03:16] va gap level as i mentioned before
[03:26] reaching into an order block now
[03:28] looking at e-mini s p micro just to get
[03:31] a feel looks like it wants to run as
[03:33] high as well
[03:34] so it kind of like gives me fuel or
[03:36] confidence that this is going to run up
[03:38] into that level so i'm going to take my
[03:40] six contracts off
[03:49] and i'm gonna change my mind and close
[03:52] it here because
[03:54] it's getting real close to the closure
[03:56] of that gap i might be wrong but uh just
[03:58] for
[04:00] general principles 14220 i think is
[04:03] doable
[04:07] all right there's the business limit
[04:09] order filled
[04:11] again i'll hover over top the entry so
[04:13] you can see it
[04:17] all right there is your entry
[04:20] and that's not bad it's the low candle
[04:23] that's what i like to show you guys
[04:25] there's the limit order exiting there
[04:27] so
[04:29] hopefully found this insightful
[04:31] james
[04:33] there's your example
[04:34] until next time be safe
