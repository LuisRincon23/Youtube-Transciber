[00:16] all right folks welcome back
[00:19] this lesson
[00:20] is going to be on
[00:22] forex
[00:23] and how we can apply this model to the
[00:26] fx market
[00:27] now if you are a longtime
[00:31] student of mine
[00:33] a lot of the things i'm going to talk
[00:34] about in here are going to be very
[00:36] familiar to you
[00:38] i promise you the things that
[00:40] the newer students that just found this
[00:42] channel
[00:43] are going to feel like they're stuck on
[00:46] majority of it is in the free lessons in
[00:50] this youtube channel okay so
[00:53] i'm going to count you to go through
[00:54] those videos and you'll get your answers
[00:55] there okay
[00:57] all right so
[00:59] if we're looking at the
[01:00] euro dollar and i'll let you know that's
[01:02] what this is this is the daily chart for
[01:03] euro
[01:04] i want you to take a look at how price
[01:06] moved above
[01:09] these relative equal
[01:10] highs right here
[01:14] now once it did that
[01:17] this took
[01:20] the buy side or buy stops
[01:23] out of the marketplace here
[01:25] then it started going lower
[01:27] what would it likely be reaching for
[01:30] next
[01:31] well it took buy side out
[01:34] here
[01:35] what do you think is resting below here
[01:39] sell stops or sell side liquidity
[01:42] now just to the left
[01:45] notice these two little devils here
[01:49] relative equal lows
[01:51] and
[01:53] with this one and this one we have
[01:56] two areas of sell side liquidity
[02:00] notice this candle here which happens to
[02:03] be monday's trading
[02:05] or yesterday's trading this
[02:09] low did not take out that low yet notice
[02:11] that
[02:13] so we have unfinished business
[02:16] below here and potentially below here
[02:19] so if this is a daily chart
[02:21] even though we've come
[02:24] from this high and had three
[02:26] consecutive down close candles
[02:29] what is the bias
[02:31] the very next candle
[02:33] what's the bias going to be
[02:36] bearish we're anticipating bearishness
[02:39] going in
[02:40] so let's take that and flush that out a
[02:42] little bit more
[02:44] so here is
[02:45] your chart that would be annotated
[02:49] and you have this level in your chart
[02:50] while you're learning it's important to
[02:52] have these types of things on your chart
[02:54] over time
[02:56] all you need is a pad and something to
[02:58] write with and you'll write down the
[02:59] levels
[03:00] majority of time
[03:02] the only time i'm showing a level on my
[03:04] chart is for teaching purposes i like to
[03:07] keep my chart clean
[03:08] and that way i'm not
[03:10] forcing that bias if i see something
[03:12] that would allow me to
[03:15] like negate
[03:17] the whole premise that i went into the
[03:19] market with
[03:20] and either reverse or move to the
[03:22] sidelines i want that clarity
[03:25] now i say that and some of you purists
[03:28] in here that just simply want to do
[03:30] everything i say and hang on every
[03:31] single one of my words
[03:33] don't
[03:35] avoid or
[03:38] don't
[03:39] try to do it without having annotations
[03:41] like having levels drawn on your chart
[03:44] because you need to train yourself to
[03:46] see it
[03:47] and what i mean by that well having
[03:48] these
[03:49] relative equal highs
[03:51] highlighted
[03:52] your buy stops would be resting above
[03:54] here and the market will go just above
[03:56] that a little bit and then once those
[03:57] buy stops are taken for anyone that's
[03:59] short
[04:01] they're getting knocked down
[04:02] in a loss
[04:04] and that flood of orders to be buying at
[04:06] the market
[04:08] is counterparty to individuals that want
[04:10] to sell short
[04:12] so smart money is selling short up here
[04:15] with the expectation it's going to go
[04:16] below this low here below here and
[04:20] potentially below that low down there
[04:24] so today's trading we had
[04:26] the open it rallies up a little bit
[04:28] then careens through the short term low
[04:31] here
[04:32] and below the relative equal lows here
[04:34] not by much we'll see it but it's still
[04:37] there
[04:38] now
[04:39] what level
[04:41] on the downside after this day close if
[04:44] we're looking for lower prices what
[04:46] could be expected to draw to obviously
[04:48] below here and below here but what price
[04:50] level
[04:53] 109 big figure so the big figure numbers
[04:57] okay or the zero levels
[04:59] they're very influential because there's
[05:01] lots of liquidity
[05:03] that is used around those levels a lot
[05:05] of commerce
[05:07] a lot of business transactions that come
[05:08] in just for the sake of simplicity 0 0
[05:11] level to 20 levels the 50 levels and the
[05:14] 80 levels
[05:15] so i dub them institutional price levels
[05:18] i teach that in the free videos in this
[05:20] youtube channel too
[05:24] all right so we're going to drop down to
[05:25] an alloy truck but before we get into
[05:26] that i'm going to revisit the
[05:29] swing trading idea that i taught
[05:32] highest up close or opening
[05:35] in this retracement up and the lowest
[05:38] open or close is here
[05:40] so i left the highlighted
[05:42] candles so you can match that up on
[05:44] yours
[05:45] and then we have this old low
[05:47] so below this olaf it goes below that
[05:50] how many
[05:51] pips can it go below that
[05:53] well
[05:55] we have
[05:57] the big figure 109 right
[06:00] remember the previous chart here watch
[06:03] over here
[06:04] that's essentially the 1.09
[06:07] big figure
[06:09] so do we have any levels in here on the
[06:11] fib that
[06:13] correspond to that well we have 1.0919
[06:16] that's possible
[06:17] then we have 1.09
[06:20] that's another level that's possible
[06:22] and we have
[06:24] 1.0901
[06:28] essentially almost the big figure right
[06:30] so we have a standard deviation
[06:33] from this swing to here
[06:35] if this is broken these are only true
[06:39] if this low is broken okay
[06:41] so this is a falcon point
[06:44] and this is a fulcrum point
[06:46] so how do we know which level we're
[06:47] going to aim for well we have those
[06:49] relative equal lows at the 109 big
[06:52] figure level
[06:54] and then we have
[06:55] our fib
[06:57] calling for these levels down here in
[06:58] the lowest one without going through
[07:01] 1.09 is this one here
[07:06] all right on the hourly chart with our
[07:09] buy side liquidity pool level here the
[07:11] market trades up into that area
[07:13] absorbing all of that liquidity then
[07:16] breaking down
[07:18] takes out a short-term low here
[07:21] and here
[07:22] and here
[07:23] retraces up in
[07:25] breaks lower
[07:27] then we go into today's trading the
[07:29] fifth
[07:31] prior to
[07:32] the day starting we know that it's
[07:34] likely to draw below here and then down
[07:36] to that 109 big figure
[07:38] have a lot of convergence around that
[07:40] 109 big figure
[07:43] at the beginning
[07:45] of the day at midnight new york local
[07:47] time
[07:48] that's going to be right in here
[07:50] if we see
[07:52] the market rally up which is what we
[07:53] want to see we want to see a protraction
[07:55] in the marketplace where it starts to go
[07:57] against the expected direction of the
[07:58] move intraday
[08:00] so if we're bearish and we're looking
[08:02] for that 109 level to be treated to and
[08:05] attack the liquidity below here
[08:07] preferably we want to see it rally first
[08:09] that's the judas swing okay that mark of
[08:11] protraction is what we're looking for
[08:13] for manipulation part of
[08:15] my concept power three which is
[08:18] accumulation manipulation distribution
[08:21] okay so
[08:23] once the day begins at midnight we're
[08:25] anticipating a move up what's it gonna
[08:28] be trading up into this imbalance in
[08:30] here
[08:31] okay so once it does that
[08:34] it kind of like forms the daily high and
[08:36] then the rest of the day you're gonna be
[08:37] looking for distribution throughout the
[08:39] day looking for lower prices
[08:44] so inside that little shaded area we're
[08:46] going to use that
[08:47] going forward
[08:49] so let's drop down to a lower time frame
[08:53] 15 minute time frame here is that
[08:55] imbalance that doesn't look that
[08:57] clean on a 15 minute time frame but the
[09:00] hourly is what we're framing it on okay
[09:03] so the market trades up into that
[09:05] here is the midnight new york local time
[09:08] candle on the 15 minute time frame
[09:11] chart
[09:12] opening price is here extended out
[09:14] throughout the day
[09:16] that is your midnight new york
[09:18] candle
[09:19] opening price
[09:23] preferably
[09:24] if we're selling short we want to see
[09:27] price trade above
[09:29] this
[09:31] opening price
[09:33] this is where smart money is
[09:34] accumulating short positions
[09:37] see that
[09:38] so the algorithm goes higher
[09:41] once more higher once more higher and
[09:44] then again right here
[09:45] and then
[09:46] begins its descent into the daily range
[09:48] low
[09:50] now what's occurring here
[09:52] this is not buying and selling pressure
[09:54] the algorithm is offering constantly
[09:56] price above this opening price
[09:59] now every single time it rallies up just
[10:01] because it does that doesn't necessarily
[10:03] mean that it's a time for you to get in
[10:05] but when you couple that with time
[10:08] of day
[10:09] and
[10:10] price
[10:11] it becomes a lot better
[10:15] notice we have an imbalance in here so
[10:17] the fair value gap there
[10:19] and
[10:20] price runs up during
[10:22] the new york open kill zone
[10:24] okay so i dubbed this specific time of
[10:26] day between seven o'clock in the morning
[10:28] new york time to 10 o'clock in the
[10:29] morning
[10:30] this is specific to 4x
[10:33] okay these times are specific
[10:35] to fx payers
[10:37] if you're going to trade an index don't
[10:39] worry about that
[10:40] you can work with the 8 30 to 11 o'clock
[10:43] in your local time
[10:45] but for 4x the algorithm is going to
[10:47] operate on these specific elements of
[10:49] time
[10:51] so if we're looking at this in balance
[10:52] here the market runs up and it
[10:54] overshoots the imbalance a little bit
[10:55] but what's it really go to
[10:56] the last closed candle which is a
[10:58] bearish order block how do we know
[10:59] there's a bearish order block
[11:01] because we have
[11:03] the imbalance here
[11:05] and it's trading back up into after a
[11:07] nice move lower so this displacement
[11:10] fair value gap lasts up close candle
[11:12] touches it there's your bearish order
[11:14] block
[11:18] dropping down into a five minute chart
[11:20] everything being as it was on the 15
[11:23] that's that order block here just being
[11:26] shown on a five minute chart but i'm
[11:28] adding now the annotation of the new
[11:29] york open kill zone seven o'clock in the
[11:31] morning begins here at the end of that
[11:33] line segment and ten o'clock is here
[11:36] so everything underneath this
[11:38] end the trend line here
[11:40] and below this part of it this all is
[11:43] during the new york open kill zone so
[11:46] you're hunting your setup for forex
[11:48] payers within that little block of time
[11:51] so during this time you're hunting your
[11:53] setup what price are you looking for
[11:55] preferably at or just above the opening
[11:57] price at midnight
[11:59] now
[12:00] if you are a
[12:02] new york session trader
[12:04] you want to refer to the opening price
[12:06] at midnight but then you want to
[12:08] recalibrate at 8 30
[12:10] and we'll look at that in a moment but
[12:11] for now
[12:12] just notice
[12:14] looking at this
[12:15] particular day on the economic calendar
[12:18] we had a high impact news driver at 10
[12:21] o'clock in the morning it was the ism
[12:23] services pmi number
[12:25] now
[12:26] before you want to start sending me
[12:28] emails
[12:29] or start sending me essay questions in
[12:32] the comments section of this video
[12:34] about
[12:35] what does the ism pmi number do what's
[12:38] it i don't care what these numbers are
[12:41] really
[12:42] discussing i don't care i don't care
[12:44] about the raw data i don't care what the
[12:46] expectation is i don't care
[12:48] okay
[12:49] what i'm expecting is the volatility in
[12:52] the marketplace at or around these
[12:54] specific times because the algorithm is
[12:56] going to use that injection of
[12:58] volatility
[12:59] to facilitate
[13:01] trades
[13:04] now is it trying to give you good trades
[13:06] no
[13:07] it's trying to move
[13:10] and rebook and reprice to levels to
[13:12] allow those in the know
[13:15] to participate
[13:16] it's a rigged game
[13:18] you're not supposed to be in it
[13:20] not consistently profitable let's say
[13:22] that way
[13:22] but
[13:23] for those that are in the know they're
[13:25] looking for these types of signatures
[13:26] and price action so they know what
[13:28] they're looking for in terms of when
[13:29] they're going to operate
[13:31] so as a technician
[13:32] they're looking for a specific element
[13:34] of time
[13:35] which is encapsulated with this segment
[13:37] right here seven o'clock to ten o'clock
[13:39] so that little bracket of time
[13:42] right there on a five minute chart
[13:44] you're hunting your setup
[13:46] what is the thresholds that make it high
[13:48] probability well if you're going short
[13:49] or looking to go short you want to be
[13:50] above the midnight opening price
[13:53] that's here extended out in time
[13:56] but now once we hit this order block
[13:58] here that was during the early stages of
[14:01] the new york open right around the seven
[14:04] o'clock
[14:05] hour
[14:07] the market drops
[14:10] and then retraces back into
[14:12] that
[14:15] news driver here at 10.
[14:17] so what's happening here is look closely
[14:19] with this swing low
[14:22] it went below this low here
[14:24] and then it rallied back up
[14:27] once more above the opening price at
[14:29] midnight does it take out this high
[14:31] no
[14:33] why doesn't it take out this high
[14:35] because it has an imbalance here
[14:38] that imbalance tells you this is an
[14:39] intermediate term high if we're bearish
[14:41] it shouldn't take this high out now
[14:43] again
[14:44] i mentioned this
[14:46] in a recent video i think if i'm not
[14:48] mistaken it was episode 12.
[14:51] i'm going by memory so please don't
[14:53] roast me in the comments section if
[14:55] that's the wrong one but it's basically
[14:56] what i'm talking about intermediate term
[14:57] short term and
[14:58] long term highs and lows or swing highs
[15:01] and lows
[15:04] a imbalance or a fair value gap
[15:07] associated with a swing higher swing low
[15:10] in this case this is imminent term high
[15:12] not because it just simply has a
[15:14] imbalance but because the narrative is
[15:16] we're expecting lower prices
[15:18] and
[15:19] it went above the opening price at
[15:21] midnight
[15:23] and the imbalance there when it retraces
[15:25] back up into this fake run ahead of the
[15:29] news driver at 10 o'clock the news if
[15:31] you will
[15:32] this movement here is only running right
[15:34] back up into the bearish order block
[15:36] last up close candle the body we don't i
[15:39] don't like to use these long tails and
[15:41] wicks i'll refer to them but i'd like to
[15:43] prefer
[15:45] to
[15:46] annotate if i'm going to show it in my
[15:48] examples or look to price returning back
[15:50] to
[15:51] the body of the candle
[15:54] right there
[15:55] so
[15:57] this return into that order block sets
[16:00] the stage for another move lower we get
[16:02] a swing high
[16:04] lower high to the
[16:06] right of this candle and a lower high to
[16:09] the left of it here so we have three
[16:11] candles making a swing high so we start
[16:13] looking for displacement and movement
[16:15] lower
[16:16] but looking closer
[16:19] after we had that
[16:21] shift in market structure here on a
[16:23] five-minute chart it retraces back up
[16:26] fair value gap
[16:28] parish order block and news this is the
[16:31] wild card okay when you have high impact
[16:33] news drivers this is going to many times
[16:36] scare you out of the trade or stop you
[16:38] out in the words if you went short back
[16:39] here and you started trailing your stop
[16:41] loss this is what that's designed to do
[16:43] take you out
[16:44] so if you're short back here or here or
[16:46] here
[16:48] how are you protecting the trade you're
[16:49] putting a buy stop above recent swing
[16:52] highs
[16:52] so they're
[16:53] jamming it up against that back above
[16:55] the opening price
[16:57] because your buy stop is going to flood
[16:58] the market with buyers
[17:00] willing to pay a higher price than it
[17:01] was here before it runs higher and
[17:04] you're going to buy
[17:06] or those individuals that have their
[17:07] stops they're going to buy
[17:09] the counterparty side of the smart money
[17:11] that wants to sell short
[17:13] because every buyer has to have a seller
[17:14] every seller has to have a buyer
[17:16] so that's what's occurring here but
[17:18] inside this shaded area
[17:22] i want to show you how this model is
[17:23] applicable here in fx
[17:27] so here's the four minute chart we were
[17:29] just looking at five so we start
[17:31] stripping down this price leg
[17:34] here and we're looking for any fair
[17:35] value gap
[17:38] do you see it
[17:41] pause the video look for it
[17:46] all right i'm about to show you this
[17:48] candle is low this candle is high
[17:50] there's your fair value cup isn't it
[17:52] interesting it just goes right up into
[17:53] there closes that in
[17:55] then and only then the market starts to
[17:57] aggressively run below the short term
[17:59] low here and then reaching into our
[18:01] objective down here at that 109
[18:03] big figure
[18:05] now it doesn't quite get to 1.09
[18:08] even
[18:09] but it does get to our fibonacci
[18:11] extension for the standard deviation it
[18:13] does get down to the old relative equal
[18:15] lows on the daily chart which is what
[18:17] that blue
[18:18] line is and look at the bodies
[18:19] respecting that level not much movement
[18:22] below it
[18:26] now for all of you raw dogs out there
[18:28] okay this is too much michael you're
[18:31] over complicating it
[18:33] you're confusing me michael you're
[18:35] talking about the midnight candle for
[18:36] the opening price and now you're talking
[18:37] about the 830 which one do i use why do
[18:39] i use it this that i don't think all
[18:41] right if you're gonna be trading fx
[18:45] you're gonna be using the 8 30 in the
[18:47] morning
[18:47] for new york session trades
[18:49] but
[18:50] refer to the new york open at midnight
[18:53] as well
[18:54] if the opening price is lower at the 830
[18:58] than that of the opening price at
[19:00] midnight
[19:01] use the lower one
[19:04] reason why is you want to set the
[19:06] minimum threshold for a due to swing or
[19:08] market protraction to the upside when
[19:09] you're bearish
[19:10] and obviously everything that i just
[19:12] said would be reverse if you're bullish
[19:14] you'd be looking for a move below the
[19:15] opening at 8 30
[19:18] to go long after it moves below it but
[19:20] we're focusing primarily on the shorting
[19:22] opportunity here in hindsight so that
[19:24] way you can
[19:25] get a better feel for how to use this
[19:27] model
[19:28] with fx so there's a subtle little
[19:31] group of nuances that you have to be
[19:32] aware of when you're looking at fx
[19:34] but it's not terribly you know
[19:37] harsh it's pretty easy to
[19:39] work with
[19:41] so we have the market
[19:43] trading above the opening price here
[19:45] market protraction due to swing it
[19:47] rallies up
[19:48] and then
[19:50] breaks down in here now this run here
[19:54] above the opening price
[19:55] does it have a fair value gap
[20:00] here's the four minute chart
[20:03] opening price now doesn't look the same
[20:05] because we're looking at a four-minute
[20:06] chart so it was anchored on a
[20:08] five-minute chart
[20:11] it rallies up
[20:13] you break lower
[20:15] fair value got right there
[20:17] trades up into it hammers it beautifully
[20:20] and then displacement trades lower
[20:22] down into that 109.
[20:25] was it one point zero nine zero one
[20:28] something or other i can't remember i
[20:29] thought i had but it hit it
[20:31] and
[20:32] i think the low of the day was 1.0901
[20:36] so
[20:38] not bad i mean it's
[20:40] pretty close to perfect right
[20:42] but
[20:43] by itself
[20:44] you don't want to try to aim for just
[20:46] that level okay because that's the best
[20:48] exit strategy you don't want to do that
[20:50] you want to fluff up your exits with
[20:54] a couple pips i like to teach my
[20:55] students three to five pips
[20:57] and if you're thinking a target is going
[21:00] to be like for instance we'll say
[21:02] 1.0900 level
[21:04] okay if that's what you think it's going
[21:06] to trade to
[21:07] put your limit order to cover your
[21:09] shorts if you're short
[21:11] at
[21:12] 1.0905
[21:14] okay
[21:15] you're not going to get the best exit
[21:17] that way but you have a spread that you
[21:19] have to incorporate when you're working
[21:20] with 4x and fx pairs
[21:23] sometimes and i've had a lot of this
[21:24] happen over the years as a fx trader
[21:26] where
[21:28] my limit order was a little too
[21:31] overzealous
[21:33] i was trying to be a little too perfect
[21:35] and i've had
[21:37] many
[21:38] amazing exits
[21:40] elude me
[21:42] because of my
[21:44] overzealous
[21:45] targeting
[21:46] so be a little bit more forgiving when
[21:48] you're trading especially 4x you got to
[21:50] incorporate the spread and i know some
[21:52] of you have brokers where it's like oh i
[21:54] have a really tight spread let me tell
[21:55] you something every broker has the
[21:56] ability to open that spread up on you
[21:58] you're seeing the best case scenario
[22:00] when that ticker is showing
[22:02] but
[22:03] trust me when it's advantageous for them
[22:06] they'll work it in their behalf not
[22:07] yours
[22:09] so make it easier for yourself just
[22:11] fluff up your excess with five pips
[22:14] okay and if you're really new just use
[22:16] 10 pips okay and if you're struggling
[22:18] with the idea that oh i don't want to do
[22:19] that i'll give up 10 pips
[22:21] well
[22:22] let me show you this
[22:26] would be your entry candle trading right
[22:27] back to this old high here so one pit
[22:30] bat or
[22:32] thereabouts
[22:33] once it hits that candle
[22:36] with this run here
[22:38] that right there would be your entry
[22:39] candle your stop would be right above
[22:41] this candle's high
[22:43] now if you're scared or whatever you can
[22:45] use this swing high and that's fine
[22:47] now in terms of
[22:49] math
[22:50] the entry price would be
[22:52] 1.096
[22:54] and your stop would be
[22:56] 1.09728 hypothetically that's not a lot
[22:59] of pips
[23:00] i would generally round that to 10.
[23:03] even though it's not technically 10 pips
[23:04] here i would round it to 10
[23:07] and just be done with it
[23:09] and
[23:10] looking at that model here and you're
[23:13] aiming for that
[23:14] essentially the 1.09 big figure fluffing
[23:17] it up a little bit so our exit price
[23:19] would be a little bit higher than that
[23:20] you guys see these things all the time
[23:22] and i just feel like using it you know
[23:24] just because i want to be cool
[23:28] the risk is here
[23:30] entry to stop
[23:32] and the distribution to your target down
[23:34] here
[23:37] risk to reward
[23:38] ratio better than eight to one
[23:41] and using a hypothetical
[23:43] 100 000
[23:45] demo account if you're doing one of
[23:46] those funded account challenges or
[23:48] whatever
[23:49] in this trade here
[23:51] this gives you
[23:52] basically what you're looking for in one
[23:54] trade
[23:55] so
[23:58] i don't know if this scratches the issue
[24:00] for you but
[24:02] the stuff works in forex it works in
[24:05] index trading
[24:07] so
[24:09] it's a matter of adjusting to what it is
[24:11] you're trying to trade
[24:12] and then there's a little bit of rule
[24:14] following that you have to know
[24:16] when it comes to index trading and fx
[24:19] fx predominantly you're working with
[24:21] seven o'clock in the morning to ten
[24:22] o'clock in the morning that's your new
[24:23] york open kill zone okay
[24:27] index trading i'm focusing on 8 30 to 11
[24:32] and i can take a trade all the way up to
[24:35] 10 40 10 45
[24:38] and still be okay i'm not interested in
[24:40] taking new trades generally after 10
[24:43] o'clock in the morning
[24:44] in the fx pair
[24:47] unless there is a news driver like we
[24:50] had this morning
[24:52] with
[24:54] the isem number the pmi number i
[24:56] mentioned earlier in the video
[24:58] so that was allowing me to be a little
[25:00] bit more forgiving
[25:02] with expectations for price
[25:06] you
[25:07] may not want to trade high impact news
[25:09] drivers
[25:10] and
[25:11] that's understandable if you don't know
[25:13] what you're doing
[25:14] but don't be afraid of them now
[25:18] with the economic counter having that
[25:19] high impact news driver at 10 o'clock
[25:21] that extends
[25:23] the new york session kill zone into the
[25:26] 11 11 30 time window
[25:28] because the volatility that it will
[25:31] bring in
[25:32] now i didn't take this trade
[25:35] i haven't taken any fx pair trades at
[25:38] all
[25:40] not for 2022 at least but
[25:43] if you're looking at a model that works
[25:45] in
[25:46] index futures
[25:49] you're looking at that 8 30 to 11
[25:51] o'clock window
[25:52] and if you're trying to apply this model
[25:54] to fx it's seven o'clock in the morning
[25:55] to 10 o'clock in the morning now
[25:58] the high impact news drivers that come
[26:00] out after 10 o'clock
[26:04] like for instance if you're a canadian
[26:05] dollar trader
[26:07] and the
[26:08] crude oil inventory number comes out
[26:10] usually like 10 30 in the morning you
[26:12] have to make allowances for that
[26:14] and just expect there'd be a likely move
[26:18] on that oil number at 10 30.
[26:21] so
[26:23] just something to throw out there i know
[26:25] a lot of you been barking wanting to see
[26:26] something
[26:28] fx related because you know
[26:29] predominantly i've been doing that since
[26:31] 2010
[26:33] but
[26:34] i humbly submit this for your
[26:36] inquiry and that way you can study this
[26:38] and listen to it a few times it has a
[26:40] couple things in there that mia went
[26:42] over your head it's not terribly
[26:45] you know
[26:46] demanding in terms of
[26:48] note-taking but there's some things in
[26:50] here that are noteworthy for you to have
[26:52] in your study journal
[26:53] and
[26:54] for the most part it looks like it works
[26:56] pretty good in this pair too or in this
[26:58] asset class
[26:59] so until i talk to you again on thursday
[27:02] be safe
