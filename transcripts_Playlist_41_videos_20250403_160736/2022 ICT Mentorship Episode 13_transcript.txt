[00:03] all right folks welcome back
[00:05] this is an
[00:07] extra lesson
[00:09] but we'll call it episode 13 nonetheless
[00:12] so last night
[00:14] i gave a lesson on market structure for
[00:16] precision technicians
[00:18] and advanced price action theory
[00:21] in action is going to be this lesson
[00:23] here
[00:24] so it's one thing to talk about it
[00:26] and provide
[00:28] the
[00:29] basis as to what i'm doing when i'm
[00:31] doing these executions
[00:32] when i'm running these demo accounts up
[00:34] really fast you know what am i doing how
[00:36] am i doing it i got a lot of questions
[00:39] as to how
[00:40] i ran the ten thousand dollar account up
[00:42] to which was at
[00:43] 256 000 this morning but it quickly got
[00:47] to a point where
[00:49] it no longer can be
[00:52] appreciated
[00:53] from students perspective
[00:55] it's too fast of growth and the
[00:58] acceleration just makes it
[01:01] well you have new you have no connection
[01:03] to it if you don't know how to do this
[01:05] and you're new
[01:06] you start seeing
[01:08] velocity
[01:09] in equity increasing even though it's a
[01:11] demo it does not matter the same
[01:13] principles are applied whether you're
[01:15] trading with a live account or if you're
[01:16] trading with a
[01:18] demo account and you're learning
[01:20] and i want to take you into
[01:23] what it is i do
[01:25] and
[01:26] how i'm able to
[01:28] run the equity up quick
[01:31] what is the mindset behind what is i'm
[01:33] doing but before i get into it let me
[01:35] remind you what i stated last night in
[01:36] the video
[01:39] because of the heightened
[01:41] volatility because of the uncertainty
[01:44] and the
[01:46] likelihood of
[01:48] price action moves that would be
[01:51] unexpected even for me
[01:54] because it's already delivered what i
[01:55] wanted to see happen anyway and i'm
[01:57] technically bearish
[01:59] on equities
[02:02] i don't feel confident
[02:05] or willing to risk after being
[02:06] profitable in live trading
[02:10] going short
[02:11] this market
[02:13] making my february gain
[02:15] i don't want to go in
[02:17] and risk that because it's already
[02:18] arrived down below
[02:20] these lows so there's an objective i
[02:22] look for for the week
[02:24] there's an objective i try to aim for
[02:26] for the day
[02:27] and there's something i'm aiming for for
[02:30] a goal
[02:31] for the month
[02:33] so truth be told
[02:36] the account that i'm showing with td
[02:38] ameritrade i'm trying to illustrate
[02:41] in my best
[02:45] ability to pantomime how it would likely
[02:48] be for a new student
[02:50] if they were to try to do
[02:53] live trading with a model
[02:56] and aiming for 20 per month now some of
[02:58] you are going to think well 20 isn't a
[03:00] lot of money
[03:01] you know it's not a lot of money well 20
[03:04] isn't money
[03:05] okay it's a percentage so i don't care
[03:07] if you start with one dollar
[03:09] if you make 20
[03:11] consistently
[03:12] the compounding effects of that
[03:15] is astonishing
[03:17] now
[03:18] is it my belief that
[03:21] my students can consistently hit
[03:23] 20 every single month
[03:26] i would never go out on a limb and say
[03:27] that
[03:29] i might not hit 20 one of the months but
[03:33] that is a goal that i'm aiming for
[03:36] and if you're a new developing student
[03:39] they have
[03:40] worked very hard to find and refine your
[03:42] own model with the things i'm teaching
[03:44] and you have a trading plan that is well
[03:47] documented you know what it is you're
[03:48] doing when you're not going to do
[03:49] something you have a complete
[03:52] understanding of what it is that's going
[03:54] to allow you to engage or not engage in
[03:56] price
[03:59] then how to manage that risk
[04:01] all those factors involved and you've
[04:03] been consistent with a demo account for
[04:04] six months
[04:06] then and only then
[04:08] would i not necessarily that you need to
[04:10] do this but i
[04:12] would then only at that time consider
[04:16] maybe
[04:17] going into life fun trading
[04:19] but i don't ever tell my students i
[04:21] never answer an email when they say
[04:23] do you think i'm really going to lie i
[04:25] don't answer those questions i say i
[04:27] don't know you tell me
[04:29] or generally i ignore those emails
[04:31] because there is never going to be a
[04:32] record of me saying
[04:34] i think you're ready to go into life on
[04:35] trading and then when they blow their
[04:37] account
[04:38] who are they going to blame
[04:40] naturally the human is going to say
[04:42] well it wasn't my fault there was a guy
[04:44] that told me i should do it
[04:46] he told me to jump off the bridge
[04:49] so
[04:50] i never put myself in that situation
[04:52] okay and i don't think any mentor or
[04:54] educator worth their salt would ever
[04:57] tell you
[04:58] to go out and risk life money because
[05:02] experience has taught me that i got into
[05:05] live trading way too fast
[05:08] way way too fast in 1992 that was the
[05:10] worst thing i could have done
[05:12] for my development was rush to get into
[05:15] real money trading and i had no idea
[05:16] what i was doing
[05:18] i tricked myself into believing it was
[05:19] so easy reading one book
[05:22] no real back testing whatsoever
[05:25] and i was like well you know i can see
[05:26] this one two three top and one two three
[05:28] bottom idea you can see it
[05:31] yeah i saw it one two three i was gone
[05:34] in my first trade 50 history goodbye
[05:38] close the account send me my money i was
[05:40] afraid
[05:41] but
[05:44] when we understand what it is we're
[05:46] trying to do obviously you it comes with
[05:48] a great deal of
[05:50] nervousness and
[05:52] anxiety because you have not put the
[05:55] time into back testing and then forward
[05:57] testing it with a demo account
[06:00] so if you feel this
[06:01] tug of war this butterfly feeling in
[06:04] your stomach where you just you can't
[06:05] relax and you're engaging in the
[06:08] marketplace
[06:09] you're not ready
[06:12] that's the bottom line you're not ready
[06:14] you have to desensitize yourself
[06:17] with the results not being
[06:21] a factor
[06:22] if you lose it doesn't make a difference
[06:24] to you
[06:26] you're indifferent to it
[06:28] and it doesn't seem possible that you
[06:29] could be indifferent to losing money
[06:32] but a student
[06:33] that has a solid
[06:35] price action model a trade plan that's
[06:36] well documented they know what they're
[06:38] going to do
[06:39] why they're doing it what they're
[06:40] waiting for
[06:42] what will cause them to push the button
[06:43] to get in
[06:45] where their stop loss is going to be how
[06:46] much they're going to risk what they're
[06:47] going to aim for where their partials
[06:49] are going to be if they're going to take
[06:50] partials at all
[06:52] you have to know those things in advance
[06:53] you can't determine them once you enter
[06:55] the marketplace and that's what retail
[06:57] traders do that's exactly what i did in
[06:59] 1992.
[07:01] i got into a trade
[07:03] and then i tried to figure out what i
[07:04] was supposed to do once i was there i
[07:06] want you to see what it is
[07:08] that i was showing last night
[07:11] and even though
[07:13] i'm not personally willing to risk my
[07:15] live account right now because of the
[07:17] conditions that we have at the present
[07:20] ukraine and all that business
[07:23] all the uncertainties you know potential
[07:25] black swan event anytime can
[07:28] pop off and i don't want to expose
[07:31] myself to that measure of risk
[07:32] especially since
[07:34] i have hit all my numbers
[07:36] the market is delivered to what i
[07:38] expected in my
[07:39] analysis so i'm not worrying
[07:42] about trying to get in and do anything
[07:43] else so how do i manage that
[07:46] desire to get back in and do some more
[07:49] i go right to a demo account i work
[07:51] inside of a paper account
[07:53] it provides me context
[07:55] it keeps me
[07:57] glued obviously to
[07:59] what the market's doing so i'm staying
[08:01] plugged in if you will
[08:03] close to the market being able to read
[08:04] the tape so that way i can answer
[08:06] student questions
[08:08] i can still teach around the markets
[08:10] doing right now
[08:12] and that way my students can still
[08:14] appreciate the level of depth that i'm
[08:16] providing
[08:17] but i'm not taking on monetary risk when
[08:21] i don't believe it's wise for me to do
[08:23] so because if i'm wrong let's say i'm
[08:25] wrong
[08:27] and i traded today with live funds or if
[08:29] i traded
[08:30] on monday and i lose what i gained in
[08:33] february
[08:34] that would eat at me
[08:36] all through the month of march
[08:38] so it's toxic thinking and i learned
[08:41] that the hard way many years ago so
[08:46] what i'm going to show you obviously was
[08:47] executions in the trading view paper
[08:49] trading account but i want to make sure
[08:52] you understand because
[08:53] it's so many people out there that have
[08:55] this issue with me teaching in a demo
[08:58] which is compliance like i'm not
[09:00] licensed to give you trade advice so i
[09:02] operate through the function of a demo
[09:04] account
[09:05] to protect me and protect you you know
[09:08] you can't make that money
[09:09] you're not following me in a trade so if
[09:11] i was wrong
[09:12] you don't take a financial loss and if
[09:15] i'm right you can't make money
[09:18] and get tricked into thinking that the
[09:19] only way you're gonna make money is to
[09:20] follow me see there's a balancing that's
[09:23] being done there
[09:24] and if i'm wrong if i don't know what
[09:26] i'm doing and these things don't work
[09:28] they'll fail on the demo account just as
[09:29] easily they would be failing in the live
[09:31] account
[09:32] so with that foundation laid let's go
[09:36] into the discussion so idea is we went
[09:38] below this low
[09:41] i don't want to sell it short even
[09:43] though i'm bearish
[09:44] so what's it likely to reach up into
[09:46] well i'm thinking it could potentially
[09:47] trade up into this up closed candle here
[09:50] okay i'm thinking it could trade into
[09:51] that the low or the open of that candle
[09:55] so that's kind of like the magnet or the
[09:57] draw on liquidity
[09:58] so
[09:59] it also
[10:01] could reach up into this little area
[10:02] right here because there's a fair value
[10:04] got there
[10:05] just like we had it here
[10:07] and here and filled in
[10:09] it can go right up into this
[10:12] go right up there and then still
[10:14] resume going lower it might need to go
[10:16] up into that
[10:18] so
[10:20] i went in this morning and i was
[10:21] watching
[10:23] the
[10:23] nasdaq and the e-mini s p
[10:25] e s p had a lot of
[10:28] energy to the upside
[10:29] and
[10:30] usually these markets move in tandem
[10:32] that means they're generally moving
[10:33] together
[10:36] and even though that nasdaq was a little
[10:38] bit lethargic and wasn't trying to go up
[10:40] as quick and as fast as es or e-mini s p
[10:44] the tendency is that it will
[10:47] be drawn to the same degree that the
[10:50] other indices were so if es was higher
[10:54] and q which is nasdaq futures should be
[10:58] you brought higher
[11:00] in sympathy
[11:02] all boats rise in high tide in basically
[11:04] what i'm saying
[11:09] now if we look at the hourly chart
[11:12] this is what i was seeing
[11:14] i was trading all this in a demo account
[11:16] and
[11:17] it ran up into
[11:19] levels
[11:20] it became absurd now so
[11:22] i satisfy my itch
[11:26] when i'm not trying to trade with the
[11:27] live account
[11:29] in the demo account and i'll run them up
[11:31] real quick
[11:32] there is no
[11:34] fraud
[11:35] required and none of those things are
[11:37] required to make these things compound
[11:39] and blow up really quick in terms of the
[11:42] equity increases
[11:44] but i'm going to show you how even with
[11:46] a micro account
[11:48] so
[11:48] if you haven't already noticed this is
[11:50] the micro e-mini nasdaq
[11:53] so every one point
[11:55] or four ticks
[11:56] is equivalent to
[11:58] two dollars
[12:00] okay
[12:01] and i went in with the idea that i'm
[12:03] using a micro account
[12:06] with a discount broker and a discount
[12:08] broker i'm hypothetically using while
[12:10] i'm taking these executions is i'm
[12:12] hypothetically
[12:14] trading with an amp
[12:16] amp futures account
[12:19] and i'll show you their margins and show
[12:20] you the details as to what i'm
[12:22] basically implying by doing these things
[12:24] here
[12:28] down closed candle
[12:29] after a run up
[12:32] we retraced
[12:33] went down inside this gap see that
[12:39] this area here
[12:40] when it trades down
[12:42] towards this gap
[12:45] this is the draw on liquidity up here as
[12:47] well near term
[12:49] so above these relative equal highs we
[12:51] have what
[12:53] livestocks or buy-side liquidity
[12:55] so i'm thinking that
[12:58] the algorithm is not letting price go
[13:00] lower
[13:01] so it's going after everyone that's been
[13:04] profitable going short
[13:06] so
[13:07] where are their stops
[13:10] right here
[13:11] so we're just going to call it 14 110
[13:16] okay real
[13:18] simple the market starts to rally
[13:23] and leaves this down closed candle
[13:26] i'm going to watch to see if it can
[13:28] trade back down into that
[13:30] because if it does i'm going to treat
[13:31] that as a bullish order block
[13:35] remember what i taught last night
[13:37] if the move has been bullish
[13:39] down closed candles should not be
[13:42] violated
[13:43] down closed candles
[13:45] should not be violated
[13:47] they're going to act as support
[13:51] bearish market moves
[13:54] up close candles should not be breached
[13:56] and broken through
[13:59] never even come back
[14:01] so when you're bearish and you're
[14:02] watching the market go down
[14:04] and you see candles starting to form a
[14:06] potential up close candle you as a
[14:08] neophyte that is new to trading
[14:11] these are the moments where you get
[14:12] scared you basically snap yourself out
[14:16] the desire to hold the trade and you
[14:18] just collapse the trade because you
[14:19] can't handle it
[14:20] it's that overwhelming
[14:22] uncertainty that eats at you like mental
[14:26] cancer it just literally makes you want
[14:28] to just get out of the trade even when
[14:30] you're profit
[14:31] you ever feel that
[14:32] the trade's profitable and you're like i
[14:35] just can't stand it anymore i gotta get
[14:36] out
[14:37] you're making money your trade is
[14:39] profitable quote unquote in a demo
[14:43] it's worse when you have live account
[14:44] funds and
[14:46] you have a profit because if you don't
[14:47] have the wherewithal and the experience
[14:49] of submitting to these ideas and
[14:51] watching them come to fruition over and
[14:53] over again
[14:55] months of experience not just a week or
[14:57] day
[14:59] you're going to feel like you just want
[15:00] to collapse the trade
[15:02] so
[15:03] when i teach my students
[15:05] when you're looking for a price move
[15:06] that's going to be a long-term
[15:08] price swing not that this is a long-term
[15:10] price swing in the sense of time but on
[15:13] this time frame
[15:14] for one hour this is a nice decline
[15:17] it's a
[15:18] prolonged
[15:20] price swing
[15:21] it's not like little tiny little
[15:23] movements in here
[15:24] and vice versa we have it here it's
[15:26] going higher
[15:28] so all the down closed candles does it
[15:30] go below this down close candle when it
[15:32] starts to retrace no
[15:34] we expect this to be areas where they're
[15:36] going to accumulate more long positions
[15:40] we retrace
[15:42] going down into an imbalance
[15:44] and the market rallies above the down
[15:46] close candle
[15:48] does it support price yes
[15:51] time of day
[15:53] is important so i'm watching when price
[15:55] comes back down into it here
[15:57] i'm taking the opening price extending
[15:58] it out in time
[16:00] when that occurs
[16:01] then i know i have a setup where i can
[16:03] go long
[16:05] but i want to go into the time frames a
[16:06] little lower than the hourly chart give
[16:08] me a little bit more context because we
[16:10] do have a low
[16:12] that has a higher low to the left and a
[16:14] higher low to the right
[16:15] so that makes this what
[16:17] enemy term
[16:18] low
[16:21] this retracement here
[16:23] this might be
[16:26] trading into an imbalance which is what
[16:28] i'm teaching you to look for
[16:30] but the overall market structure is
[16:32] it's likely to go higher and aim for a
[16:35] run above these highs
[16:39] by side liquidity resting right up there
[16:42] so we're going to take these levels
[16:44] this red level is anchored to this here
[16:47] relative equal highs
[16:49] five stops are above that
[16:51] rallies comes back down in we're looking
[16:54] to see if it wants to run through that
[16:57] notice this high
[16:59] in this high it creates what
[17:01] relative equal highs
[17:03] retail-minded traders are going to see
[17:04] that and say oh this is exactly what the
[17:06] text say about resistance
[17:09] so it's acting as a ceiling
[17:12] price acting like a ceiling what should
[17:14] they expect to see price do go over
[17:22] so here's that level where the body
[17:23] stops are
[17:26] we're above it rather here's that hourly
[17:28] down closed candle which is a bullet
[17:30] shorter block
[17:33] notice the down closed candle is made up
[17:35] of two candles on the fifth minute time
[17:38] frame
[17:40] price moves away from it goes above it
[17:41] right here does it create an imbalance
[17:43] here
[17:44] yes
[17:45] that is how you determine your high
[17:47] probability bullish order block it must
[17:50] have the imbalance
[17:52] coupled with the down closed candle
[17:55] and the underlying narrative that it's
[17:57] likely to go higher to reach for buy
[17:59] side liquidity
[18:01] period okay it's it's that's it
[18:05] there is no
[18:06] engulfing candle does this forget all
[18:09] that you don't need that okay it's
[18:11] the gap
[18:13] plus the down closed candle plus the
[18:15] idea that's likely to go for my side
[18:16] liquidity
[18:18] that's it okay
[18:20] so
[18:22] i just noticed by the way there's a guy
[18:23] out there
[18:24] trying to hawk a seven dollar indicator
[18:27] and
[18:28] he says he's the real deal
[18:31] and it's all about order blocks
[18:33] and
[18:35] i'm not going to change the name on that
[18:37] just let you know
[18:40] so we're trading down into this
[18:42] imbalance here
[18:45] but now we're doing it at the time of
[18:46] day after the equity is open at 9 30 in
[18:49] the morning new york time
[18:50] so
[18:51] volatility
[18:53] the initial move is
[18:55] technically the
[18:56] incorrect move
[18:59] going into the opening at 9 30. so this
[19:01] is like a judas swing
[19:03] so think about what we're seeing here
[19:04] now
[19:06] the markets likely go up above this
[19:07] level here to take the buy side because
[19:09] the market's unwilling to go lower the
[19:11] algorithm keeps pressing higher higher
[19:14] it retraces down into the 930 opening
[19:17] this is that fake move
[19:19] don't chase this
[19:21] and don't chase going higher right
[19:23] before the equity is opening 930 either
[19:25] so you have to take a step back and
[19:26] figure out what is your looking for
[19:29] well i'm looking for a discount market
[19:33] low
[19:34] to high i'm below 50 yes i'm inside the
[19:37] order block yes
[19:40] the equities opening has happened
[19:42] i'm bullish and it has traded lower so
[19:44] public is going to be thinking what it's
[19:46] resistance
[19:47] it's going to keep going down
[19:49] to what there's your support level
[19:51] because it bounced there last time so
[19:53] they're going to think there
[19:55] well
[19:56] it doesn't do that
[20:00] down to a five minute chart
[20:04] it hits the order block and then rallies
[20:08] what is this
[20:12] what's your favorite gun
[20:14] market trades back down in overlaps that
[20:16] gap between this candle's high and this
[20:18] candle is low
[20:19] this right here
[20:21] that right there
[20:24] that is one order block
[20:26] with a lower time frame order block and
[20:29] a fair value cut
[20:31] you can take that trade if you know what
[20:33] you're looking for and you understand
[20:35] bias narrative
[20:37] and where the liquidity matrix is likely
[20:39] to lead to later on which is drawing up
[20:42] above this red level here
[20:44] my stops are above here
[20:47] so if they're going to send the price
[20:49] higher from here
[20:50] and start rallying that supposes that
[20:53] there's someone that got on board long
[20:55] here where would their ideal exit be
[20:59] six points higher
[21:01] 10 points higher no
[21:03] you're going to want to take it up here
[21:05] where there's willing
[21:06] buyers
[21:08] with buy stocks to protect their short
[21:09] positions
[21:11] so when the market trades above that
[21:12] level
[21:13] the buy stops become market orders to
[21:15] buy the market which floods the market
[21:17] with liquidity for those that have
[21:18] bought down here
[21:20] they can sell to those willing buyers at
[21:22] a higher price
[21:23] which they're waiting for
[21:25] down here
[21:26] and waiting for that price rally to go
[21:28] up now as the market goes higher
[21:31] the expectation is my expectation was
[21:34] i want to go along in here
[21:35] and reach for this high
[21:40] this was my entry
[21:42] idea that it's overlapping filling in
[21:43] that gap and it's an order block here
[21:46] with a higher timeframe order block
[21:47] there so there's an hierarchy higher
[21:50] time frame to a lower time frame with
[21:51] the idea
[21:53] framed on
[21:54] it's going higher
[21:55] for buy side
[21:57] i have an intermediate term low
[21:59] forming
[22:01] and now
[22:02] this
[22:03] when it fills in that gap
[22:05] once that happens what did i teach you
[22:07] last night this becomes
[22:08] an intermediate term low
[22:12] this low should not be taken out once it
[22:14] starts rallying it should not come back
[22:15] down here
[22:17] what else did i teach you
[22:19] if price is going higher
[22:20] down closed candles should support price
[22:24] well it trades above it here this down
[22:26] close candle is high right there it
[22:28] trades above it on this candle right
[22:29] there and starts going higher but then
[22:31] look what happens it starts to go back
[22:32] down
[22:33] you might come down here and stop me up
[22:35] i'm not thinking that i'm looking at
[22:37] this down close candle thinking it's
[22:38] only going right back down into this
[22:40] down close candle to accumulate more
[22:42] long positions
[22:44] so smart money traders are going to be
[22:46] buying more here
[22:47] like i did
[22:49] rallied
[22:51] we have down close candles
[22:52] we went above it
[22:55] i'm not worrying about the market as
[22:56] long as it doesn't take out these two
[22:58] down close candles
[22:59] trades down gets real close to that but
[23:02] does it eat up and go through
[23:05] that range of these two down close
[23:06] candles no it just retraces down into
[23:08] what an imbalance why so smart money can
[23:11] buy again
[23:12] like i did
[23:14] the market rallies again
[23:15] and goes into
[23:18] the bicep equity
[23:24] order block
[23:25] trades through it here get long
[23:29] fair value got
[23:31] order block
[23:32] retracement get long
[23:36] order block
[23:37] imbalance with the fair value gap trades
[23:40] back down
[23:41] doesn't even come back down into the
[23:43] order block
[23:44] this is classic it generally doesn't
[23:46] like to go all the way back in rebalance
[23:47] when it's that close to the profit
[23:48] objective so the algorithm only has a
[23:50] small little retracement inside the fair
[23:52] value gap so you would be a buyer
[23:54] just that that candle is
[23:56] low
[23:58] it runs right to
[24:00] the
[24:02] target now i know some of you
[24:06] just don't trust me
[24:09] these are trading view execution errors
[24:11] and i'm going to log in to trading view
[24:13] and actually show you
[24:15] by highlighting these actual arrows
[24:18] but i'm going to take you down into the
[24:20] charts
[24:22] they'll all be all the way down into a
[24:23] 30 second chart so you can see the
[24:24] grouping of where i actually entered
[24:26] with this logic okay
[24:28] now remember enemy term low is down here
[24:30] this should never be overtaken until the
[24:33] objectives reached
[24:36] so all this price action leg here
[24:38] is
[24:39] i trust that it's going to keep going
[24:41] higher as long as the down closed
[24:43] candles keep price above it
[24:47] above what above the down close candles
[24:49] that's going to be supporting
[24:50] each new leg higher the market should
[24:53] not retrace back down below those
[24:55] so what am i saying
[24:57] for trailing stop losses
[24:59] you do not want to take your stop loss
[25:01] if say you brought it down here like i
[25:03] did
[25:03] and your stop was below the middle of
[25:05] this candle that's mean threshold of the
[25:07] bullshort block so i don't think it's
[25:09] going to go down below that once i'm
[25:10] entering
[25:11] then it starts around goes above this
[25:13] candle's
[25:14] high
[25:16] my stop-loss must remain below this
[25:18] candle's low because it can dig into
[25:20] that candle
[25:21] because it's going to act as a order
[25:23] block
[25:24] then the market rallies away comes back
[25:26] down retraces now if i put my stop loss
[25:30] inside this area here
[25:32] i'm stopped out prematurely
[25:33] chances are you probably wouldn't have
[25:35] the wherewithal to get back in you'd
[25:37] think well
[25:38] i just lost out one potential profit i
[25:41] made a little gain but i'm afraid to get
[25:43] back in you because it took me out
[25:45] that's infancy that's because you don't
[25:48] know what you're doing
[25:49] everybody was like that i was like that
[25:52] but you grow out of it
[25:54] if you do the same things i'm teaching
[25:56] you over time
[25:57] it's built into your understanding and
[25:59] it's ingrained in your understanding
[26:01] about price delivery
[26:03] the market rallies above takes out these
[26:05] two down closed candles now the stock
[26:07] can be raised from whatever would be
[26:10] below this down close candle now it can
[26:13] be raised below this down closed candle
[26:15] because the idea is these closed candles
[26:17] are one order block that should not be
[26:20] violated if it's bullish
[26:22] if it comes down and breaks the low of
[26:24] these down closed candles
[26:26] well there you go
[26:28] you probably did the right thing by
[26:29] getting stopped down
[26:30] because it might be failing and going
[26:32] lower how's that for logic
[26:36] you're not gonna be perfect i'm not
[26:38] perfect
[26:39] even though you see these errors on the
[26:40] lowest candle here
[26:42] and it goes out to the exit here right
[26:44] above that
[26:45] this is not photoshopped i've never had
[26:48] to do a photoshop okay i've never had to
[26:50] do that
[26:51] but i'm teaching you the logic right out
[26:52] of last night's lesson i went right into
[26:55] the market this morning no it's not done
[26:56] with a live account
[26:58] but i'm showing you in theory
[27:01] with the application of a demo account
[27:03] which is the same live data that would
[27:06] be utilized in my td ameritrade account
[27:09] or your live account if you have one
[27:11] these candles are forming just like they
[27:12] would be in your live account
[27:16] but i'm executing with the logic i'm
[27:17] teaching you right out of last night's
[27:19] lesson
[27:21] now
[27:25] here is the one-minute chart
[27:28] all right so here we're over in trading
[27:30] view
[27:31] everything is
[27:32] live printing right now this is
[27:37] where we're at at the moment it's just
[27:38] hanging around that old high
[27:43] now i'm not upset i missed this move
[27:45] here i could care less
[27:47] i'm going for logical
[27:49] places where liquidity is going to be
[27:51] resting
[27:52] and i'm entering
[27:54] in logical places that would
[27:57] reasonably expect to see price advance
[27:59] higher from where i'm buying
[28:01] it's not complicated
[28:03] but watching last night's lesson can
[28:06] feel like you're trying to learn
[28:09] a foreign language and expect it to
[28:11] understand how to speak it fluently two
[28:13] hours later
[28:14] don't let that happen okay
[28:18] i can make these lessons
[28:20] as deep
[28:22] as i want them to be but i'm showing you
[28:24] how i'm taking very complex topics
[28:27] and simplifying them in a manner that
[28:30] hopefully is easily
[28:32] received by you as a student
[28:36] so i showed you the hard
[28:38] perspective
[28:40] last night
[28:41] that's advanced market structure
[28:45] now i've simplified it within the scope
[28:47] of what i teach in this youtube channel
[28:49] do you see the difference
[28:51] it's only in the manner of how i'm
[28:53] teaching it but it's the same things
[28:56] it's the same ideas that i've just
[28:59] simply made it easier i've created a
[29:02] language
[29:03] that helps me communicate what i taught
[29:06] last night in a much more palatable
[29:09] method
[29:10] so that way
[29:11] it's not as complicated seeing it like
[29:13] this
[29:14] this makes sense to you all you're like
[29:16] okay now we're back into this stuff it
[29:17] makes sense now i'm teaching you the
[29:18] same thing i taught you last night
[29:21] i'm just not teaching it to you
[29:24] at the degree that is
[29:26] in my head
[29:28] you might be thinking well you know keep
[29:30] it to yourself i see i don't need to see
[29:31] it like that and that's okay i get it
[29:33] it's fine
[29:34] but
[29:35] this right here these are the elements
[29:37] that make up
[29:40] really simple
[29:42] logical setups
[29:44] that repeat every single week and many
[29:46] times every day
[29:49] so
[29:51] i started i ran up the other
[29:53] paper trading account to like 200 some
[29:55] thousand dollars this morning and
[29:58] i was thinking myself okay now we're in
[29:59] territories it's just gonna feel silly
[30:02] you're not gonna have any interest in
[30:03] seeing that it's it at that point it
[30:06] becomes okay
[30:07] now we're absurd you know it's just
[30:09] ridiculous you're not going to believe
[30:11] that this is possible
[30:13] or maybe some of you do and you think
[30:14] you want to go out there and try to do
[30:15] the same thing with your live account
[30:18] either one of those things
[30:20] are not my goal okay it's just me
[30:24] losing myself in price action so
[30:28] i treat it like a game
[30:30] it's a
[30:32] puzzle
[30:33] so i'm looking for
[30:36] the outcome
[30:38] of a specific trading session or a
[30:40] trading day
[30:41] and i'm trying to navigate those
[30:43] candlesticks and that's what you're
[30:45] seeing here
[30:47] if i hover over top of these little
[30:49] arrows
[30:51] okay you can see that they're not
[30:52] photoshopped
[30:56] and
[30:57] you make them appear
[30:59] by going into the trading view settings
[31:00] and you click the little execution
[31:03] box here
[31:04] watch below the swing lows and above
[31:06] that something high you'll see them
[31:08] toggle on and off it's all going on and
[31:11] off
[31:11] okay
[31:13] so this is
[31:15] proving precision number one it's
[31:17] proving theory in action
[31:21] and it's proving
[31:22] that it's not
[31:24] flawed logic
[31:25] none of this is retail absolutely none
[31:27] of it
[31:28] there's nothing here that's elliott wave
[31:30] none of it's harmonic
[31:32] none of it is supply and demand
[31:34] none of this is chris laurie's stuff
[31:37] i have a lot of chris laurie students
[31:39] lots of them
[31:41] and they'll tell you this isn't even
[31:43] taught in his stuff either so
[31:45] with that said let's go over to
[31:48] the paper trading account
[31:50] this is just again illustrate
[31:53] for the folks that say well you know you
[31:54] can't really grow an account if you're
[31:56] using micro accounts and that was some
[31:59] of the comments i got also and i'm like
[32:02] stop thinking you need a lot to make a
[32:05] lot you don't you need to be able to
[32:07] compound
[32:09] the things that you see me do
[32:11] in these accounts and they're being
[32:13] parlayed up really quick
[32:15] every time
[32:17] i'm buying like i bought right here let
[32:19] me see if i can get this to go away for
[32:20] a second when i bought the three
[32:23] micros here
[32:26] the next time i see a buy signal that's
[32:28] below the area i'm aiming for above that
[32:30] red level
[32:32] i'm gonna try to buy more but i'm not
[32:33] gonna buy more than three
[32:36] i'm gonna buy now two
[32:39] i'm pyramiding
[32:41] i'm building the biggest position
[32:42] initially and then every time i buy in
[32:45] again i'm building it with a smaller
[32:47] position than i had prior to the when
[32:49] i'm entering now
[32:51] because i have all the equity behind
[32:53] that entry with three supporting the two
[32:57] i'm buying here so even if it starts to
[32:59] re you know retrace too deep on me i
[33:01] have the ability to weather a little bit
[33:03] more whereas if i say
[33:05] i want to be a buyer of one here
[33:07] two here
[33:08] three here that's an inverted pyramid
[33:11] it's not stable imagine a pyramid upside
[33:13] down and it's balancing on its point
[33:15] it's not
[33:16] it's not a solid foundation it's wobbly
[33:19] so i'm building the biggest base at the
[33:21] bottom of the pyramid or position size
[33:24] in its initial position entry so i'm
[33:26] buying three here
[33:28] then i'm buying two here
[33:31] then i'm buying one here
[33:33] and then i'm letting it run to my profit
[33:34] objective
[33:36] okay
[33:37] with that said starting with a
[33:38] hypothetical ten thousand dollar account
[33:41] just this morning
[33:45] over 21
[33:48] one trade
[33:49] with three
[33:51] scalings
[33:53] okay i consider this all one trade i
[33:55] don't consider this three separate
[33:57] trades it's one trade
[34:00] scaled in largest
[34:02] middle
[34:03] last portion
[34:05] then it runs to my objective
[34:08] so the account history
[34:10] starts with ten thousand dollars here
[34:12] ends with twelve thousand one hundred
[34:13] eleven dollars demo money okay
[34:16] the history tab shows you here and if
[34:19] i'm not mistaken
[34:21] i have everything shown don't know
[34:24] yeah time everything's toggled here
[34:26] nothing's hidden
[34:28] none of that and then you can see over
[34:30] here
[34:31] all the business there
[34:34] okay
[34:35] so my question to you is this
[34:40] who cares if you gotta trade a micro
[34:42] account
[34:44] three micros two more micros one more
[34:47] micro that's six micro contracts
[34:52] that requires
[34:54] technically
[34:55] twelve hundred dollars
[34:57] so i really didn't need the ten thousand
[34:58] dollars to do these trades but in my
[35:01] mind with proper leverage and
[35:04] money management ten thousand dollars
[35:06] with this position size and gearing
[35:09] that's optimal anything more than this
[35:11] would have been too much leverage for
[35:13] that account
[35:15] to make 21 plus
[35:18] in one trade
[35:21] who's going to argue against that being
[35:24] well above average
[35:27] now what happens if you do that
[35:32] once a week
[35:33] and that's your trade
[35:35] and you stop
[35:37] and once you hit it you end your trading
[35:39] that's it and then you go to a demo
[35:41] account
[35:43] you have any idea
[35:45] the leaps and bounds that you can have
[35:48] in your equity increasing and the peace
[35:51] of mind knowing that you don't have to
[35:52] over trade
[35:54] that's what i'm trying to cultivate here
[35:55] in this community folks i'm not trying
[35:57] to create monsters that they trade every
[35:59] single day
[36:00] because i say these likely form every
[36:02] single day but they absolutely form
[36:03] every single week that is not an
[36:05] invitation for you to go out and say ict
[36:07] said trade every day
[36:09] no it's not what i said i'm saying if
[36:11] you miss a trade
[36:13] you're likely to find one tomorrow
[36:15] well not tomorrow because it's saturday
[36:16] but you know what i mean the next
[36:17] trading day
[36:20] so there's a balancing act that you have
[36:22] to have
[36:22] when you're listening to me
[36:24] you just can't take one comment that i
[36:26] say and take it completely out of
[36:28] context and say
[36:29] well i see he's a day trader and he's
[36:31] proven that he's really precise these
[36:33] concepts work i watched a couple videos
[36:35] i trusted so now i'm gonna go out
[36:36] looking at charts and i think i see it
[36:37] forming right now and i'm going in all
[36:39] in i'm in it
[36:41] and then you're sitting down writing an
[36:42] email to me saying i blew my account
[36:46] whose fault is that
[36:48] it's not mine
[36:50] it's yours
[36:51] when i blew my accounts it wasn't my
[36:53] broker's fault
[36:55] it was mine
[36:56] i did not know what i was doing
[36:58] i was out of control
[36:59] taking 60 70 trades in a day
[37:06] when you lose control
[37:08] and you have no idea what you're doing
[37:10] it's impossible for you to execute like
[37:12] this
[37:15] you have to think about these
[37:17] examples
[37:19] as
[37:20] the goal
[37:23] not that you want to be this precise
[37:26] right from the beginning because you
[37:27] can't be no one is it takes time to grow
[37:29] into that in your understanding
[37:31] but it takes
[37:32] some measure of goal setting that you
[37:34] have to have you know you listen to some
[37:37] people after they pretend to be teachers
[37:38] they'll say
[37:41] having a weekly goal or a daily goal is
[37:43] the stupidest thing in the world
[37:45] really
[37:47] i guarantee you these people are not
[37:48] profitable that say that
[37:50] they're hit and miss
[37:52] they have periods of drawdown that are
[37:53] much longer than most people would be
[37:55] willing to
[37:57] endure
[38:00] and if you don't aim
[38:02] for a target you're going to hit nothing
[38:06] 100 of the time
[38:08] you have to have a goal
[38:10] so if your goal is
[38:13] to hit nothing
[38:15] then obviously don't set a goal
[38:17] but i set very low hanging objectives in
[38:20] front of me
[38:21] these things are extremely easy for my
[38:24] capability and for many of my students
[38:27] from the 2016 group and 2017 group they
[38:30] can take trades like this
[38:33] in fact i have a woman
[38:35] in my group from the first group from
[38:37] australia that is phenomenal she does
[38:40] very very well
[38:42] and
[38:43] these are trades that i believe that
[38:46] even you
[38:48] as a youtube student
[38:50] in this mentorship on my youtube channel
[38:53] i believe in six months
[38:55] of practice and looking at price action
[38:58] you can do this yourself
[39:00] and do it consistently
[39:03] consistently what do you mean every day
[39:05] michael no
[39:07] one time a week finding something like
[39:08] this
[39:09] and working that position in like that
[39:11] absolutely
[39:13] i'm making myself available twice a week
[39:14] this is an extra video today because i
[39:16] know last night's video was a little bit
[39:18] more deeper
[39:20] than you're accustomed to
[39:21] and i'm not suggesting or implying that
[39:23] the lessons are going to go that
[39:24] direction
[39:26] i'm just stating that when i'm studying
[39:28] market structure i'm studying with that
[39:30] degree and more
[39:32] but i had to create a language
[39:35] that gets to
[39:37] generally the basis of what that is
[39:39] doing
[39:40] without all the complications within it
[39:43] so
[39:44] be glad that i'm not requiring you to
[39:47] understand that degree because the
[39:49] language i'm teaching like in here is
[39:51] accomplishing the same
[39:53] method
[39:54] just doing it without all of the extra
[39:57] acrobatics
[39:58] because i know what you're going to be
[40:00] questioning
[40:01] you're probably looking at your chart
[40:02] thinking how do i classify this swing
[40:04] high is any term high versus a short
[40:05] term high in a long term high how does
[40:07] he know right that's the part you're
[40:09] never going to get
[40:11] so i had to create a language that makes
[40:13] it simple
[40:14] and that's what you see in my lessons on
[40:16] this youtube channel
[40:19] i showed by comparing and contrasting
[40:22] where i came from and what i'm providing
[40:25] to the public
[40:28] i can show you
[40:29] just how complicated the real
[40:32] intricacies are behind these
[40:33] marketplaces but you do need to know
[40:35] certain things that repeat and they're
[40:37] very generic in price and they're not
[40:39] linked or
[40:41] built upon the foundation of anything
[40:43] that's retail logic none of that stuff
[40:46] not support resistance not any of those
[40:48] other disciplines that people use and
[40:50] you make businesses around
[40:52] selling books and courses and such
[40:55] so
[40:57] one of the cool things
[40:59] that
[41:01] if you still are a trader that uses like
[41:03] elliott wave and harmonix and things
[41:05] like that
[41:08] if you start studying what i'm teaching
[41:10] you
[41:12] for free right here
[41:14] you're gonna find that your trades
[41:17] that win
[41:19] have my information underneath
[41:23] and when your trades fail
[41:26] the things i'm teaching you here
[41:29] are missing
[41:32] see
[41:32] this is what i asked last night in the
[41:34] closing the video and i'm closing this
[41:35] video now again
[41:37] the mystery
[41:39] that plagues
[41:41] all speculators
[41:42] is
[41:44] what
[41:46] trading approach
[41:49] is the one that's going to make me money
[41:52] and i don't have to worry about losing
[41:56] more money in flawed
[41:58] approaches of trading
[42:00] what you're saying is
[42:02] there's a method out there
[42:05] that is better
[42:07] than everyone else
[42:10] i'm humbly submitting to you
[42:12] you have found it
[42:15] it's not costing you anything
[42:17] but it's going to require some work it's
[42:19] going to require some time
[42:21] effort it's going to feel like you can't
[42:23] get it it's going to feel like you're
[42:25] never going to understand it that's all
[42:27] normal
[42:28] it's all normal
[42:31] but you'll get it
[42:32] there's folks in my 2016 group that
[42:34] couldn't get it
[42:35] they got it now
[42:39] it took them a couple years
[42:41] others they get it real quick
[42:43] i don't understand
[42:45] why some get it quicker than others i
[42:47] just know that it's like that and you
[42:49] might be one of those slower learners
[42:52] it's okay
[42:53] i was a slow learner
[42:55] but once you learn
[42:56] it it's yours
[42:59] you don't forget it's like riding a bike
[43:02] and that should be your passion and your
[43:03] pursuit to get to know how to do this
[43:06] like riding a bike
[43:08] you can put the bike down for a couple
[43:09] years and then get back on again and
[43:11] just like you never
[43:13] stop writing it
[43:15] and that's a comfort and a confidence
[43:17] that is something that i can't
[43:19] articulate in the words
[43:21] and if you are able to find consistency
[43:23] and profitability
[43:26] it doesn't matter what you're doing in
[43:27] the economies then doesn't matter how
[43:29] much it's going to cost you for a gallon
[43:31] of gas
[43:32] or how much it's going to cost you on
[43:33] your groceries
[43:34] because you can outpace inflation
[43:38] if you know what you're doing in these
[43:39] markets
[43:41] that should be your goal
[43:42] always outpace inflation
[43:48] and there should be no concern
[43:50] i'm not promising you rich
[43:52] can you get wealthy with this sure you
[43:54] can
[43:55] am i promising it's going to happen for
[43:56] you no way
[43:59] will you lose money in the process
[44:01] absolutely i'm guaranteeing you're going
[44:02] to lose money
[44:04] every trading system discipline educator
[44:07] everybody
[44:08] loses in trading they take losses
[44:11] some take
[44:12] stunning losses and others just take
[44:15] mediocre losses that are just nuisance
[44:18] other traders that are really really
[44:20] good can have periods of drawdown and
[44:22] then regain that equity draw down back
[44:26] and it's like it didn't even happen
[44:28] not even skip a beat
[44:31] that's experience
[44:34] these are all bridges that you're going
[44:36] to cross
[44:37] you're going to cross them at times and
[44:39] intervals that i can't outline
[44:42] in advance for you but i generally know
[44:44] the concerns and questions that you have
[44:46] at this point
[44:48] my request to you is to suspend those
[44:52] feelings that you have to have all the
[44:54] answers right now because you don't
[44:58] you have to be
[45:00] more diligent
[45:01] about
[45:03] placing yourself in front of the charts
[45:05] and back testing and researching what
[45:07] i'm showing you because it's there
[45:09] and by seeing that over and over again
[45:12] it's better than a book it's better than
[45:14] a course
[45:15] it's better than a mentorship that you
[45:17] pay
[45:18] because i'm teaching you how to go into
[45:20] price and price will teach you
[45:23] it will teach you
[45:25] it's repeating
[45:27] so if it's repeating
[45:29] and you're looking at it constantly
[45:32] you are training your eye to see what it
[45:35] does
[45:36] by default
[45:39] when you buy a book
[45:43] and you look at the examples in the book
[45:44] each chapter has an idea that it's
[45:46] trying to focus on
[45:47] how many examples do you generally see
[45:50] just a handful at most right
[45:53] but
[45:54] remember what was like when you got a
[45:55] trading book for the first time and you
[45:57] looked at it and you saw
[45:59] bearish diversions and bullish
[46:00] divergence was the caustic indicator and
[46:03] it made it lower low in the price but it
[46:04] didn't make a lower low in the
[46:05] stochastic and it was a bullish
[46:07] divergence and you were thinking man i
[46:09] can see that that's easy
[46:11] and then you start looking at it on a
[46:12] live chart and when you thought it was
[46:14] diverging
[46:16] it just kept going lower in price
[46:22] they're only going to show you the
[46:23] examples that help sell the book
[46:25] because they don't want you to return
[46:26] the book
[46:29] i'm teaching you how to go through price
[46:31] action and fared out these repeating
[46:33] signatures
[46:35] and
[46:36] it isn't just a handful of examples it's
[46:38] every week
[46:40] every
[46:40] day and it won't stop
[46:44] so enjoy your weekend
[46:46] i will touch base with you on tuesday
[46:47] lord willing and until then
[46:50] be safe
