[00:17] all right folks welcome back
[00:19] all right so this is the tuesday january
[00:21] 25th 2022
[00:23] ict mentorship on the youtube channel
[00:26] all right so
[00:28] this is the internal range liquidity and
[00:30] market structure shift lecture
[00:35] all right so i gave you homework on the
[00:37] community tab if you have not been
[00:39] paying attention to that that's where
[00:40] i'm kind of keeping you abreast as to
[00:43] what you should be expecting next or
[00:45] something that just comes to mind that i
[00:46] feel like sharing so this is the link i
[00:48] sent out the other day
[00:50] and i wanted you to go through
[00:52] this particular chart
[00:54] and look for reasons that provided the
[00:56] market structure shift and the buy side
[00:59] and sell side liquidity
[01:02] so if you have not done that please stop
[01:04] the video
[01:05] and do that now otherwise you're
[01:06] cheating yourself of learning
[01:07] opportunity
[01:11] all right so here is that chart
[01:14] again 15 minute time frame on the e-mini
[01:17] nasdaq 100 futures contract for march
[01:19] delivery 2022.
[01:22] and take your attention over here
[01:24] okay this old low
[01:30] and these relative equal highs see that
[01:33] old low below that is cell stops
[01:37] and relative equal highs above that is
[01:39] buy stops
[01:40] now you could have used this high here
[01:42] there's nothing inherently wrong about
[01:43] that but whenever i see
[01:45] equal highs like this might and if it's
[01:47] higher than an old high over here i'm
[01:49] going to use that so that way there's a
[01:50] little bit of insight for you for your
[01:52] study journal
[01:55] the sell side liquidity
[01:57] you can see that the market trades down
[01:58] hits that runs through it
[02:01] then rallies all the way back up
[02:03] clearing equal highs
[02:05] so the buy stops have been taken here
[02:07] okay so at both of these price points
[02:10] here
[02:11] and here
[02:12] that's the
[02:15] i guess the point at which you'll look
[02:18] for or anticipate a market structure
[02:20] shift
[02:21] you don't force it okay i see a lot of
[02:23] people try to teach my concepts it'll
[02:25] talk about market structure breaks or
[02:27] shifts and we'll use that term
[02:28] interchangeably
[02:30] but
[02:31] for
[02:33] intraday i want you to think about
[02:34] intraday market structure shifts because
[02:37] it's not necessarily a
[02:39] break in market structure that leads to
[02:41] prolonged
[02:43] multi-day
[02:45] movement okay
[02:47] what do i mean by that
[02:49] if you see a market structure that's
[02:51] bearish
[02:52] and it's broken to the downside
[02:55] intraday that may just lead to an
[02:57] intraday price leg that may eventually
[03:00] see that high be taken out in the same
[03:03] day so that's why i'm using the term
[03:05] market structure shift
[03:07] not market structure break
[03:10] for our conversation here on this
[03:11] mentorship just know that when i'm
[03:14] gonna lean on that term market structure
[03:16] break
[03:17] it means a little bit more in context
[03:19] versus an intraday shift in market
[03:22] structure just means that there's likely
[03:24] a downside
[03:26] draw
[03:27] or an upside draw intraday by saying the
[03:29] term shift okay so there's a little bit
[03:31] of semantics there
[03:33] all right so we have
[03:34] both of these areas
[03:36] here
[03:38] and here where there would be a
[03:40] likelihood of a market structure shift
[03:43] up here we look for a fake run above
[03:46] here
[03:47] so that fake run above how do we know
[03:49] it's going to be a market structure
[03:50] shift that's bearish
[03:52] i get that question a lot even from
[03:53] mentorship students
[03:56] what you're looking for is the evidence
[03:57] i'm going to show you here tonight okay
[03:59] forget everything else everybody else
[04:01] says about market structure breaks and
[04:02] shifts and all that stuff
[04:04] this is it okay this is the brass tacks
[04:06] there's absolutely nothing else that you
[04:08] need to know about it i promise you if
[04:11] they add anything to it it's just
[04:12] because they want to sound and look
[04:14] different but this is the algorithmic
[04:16] perspective of a market structure shift
[04:18] in today
[04:21] now keep
[04:22] this price level in mind so it's
[04:24] essentially fourteen thousand six
[04:25] hundred
[04:26] and fourteen thousand eight twenty we're
[04:28] just eyeballing it okay
[04:32] now dropping all the way down into a two
[04:34] minute chart
[04:36] this is that same particular day
[04:39] here's those relative equal highs
[04:42] and
[04:43] this run down here
[04:45] okay
[04:48] if you recall
[04:51] 14 6
[04:54] and around that 14 860 or so okay
[05:00] if you look at this
[05:01] market structure
[05:04] without having the levels on your chart
[05:06] it's easy to get lost
[05:08] in all the quote unquote noise the
[05:10] uninitiated and i know it's going to
[05:13] razz the people that don't care to
[05:14] really learn here
[05:16] but the uninitiated folks that will
[05:18] watch a video or listen to some of the
[05:20] lectures i'll put out
[05:22] they're trying to bring something in
[05:24] they're trying to bring in their
[05:25] preconceived notions and ideas about
[05:27] what they think they understand about
[05:29] markets or technical analysis or
[05:31] something
[05:32] in price action
[05:33] and i want to kind of like
[05:36] allow you to just put that aside for a
[05:38] moment and just imagine
[05:40] this chart
[05:42] is the first time you looked at price
[05:43] action for the first time and that's
[05:45] hard but kind of like strip away
[05:46] everything else that you want to
[05:48] bring to the conversation no order block
[05:51] discussion no breaker no none of that
[05:53] stuff okay supply and demand elliott
[05:55] wave all that garbage if you look at
[05:57] this price action here
[05:59] when we had this low form
[06:03] right before this low was formed there's
[06:06] a swing high right there
[06:09] now in the first mentorship video i gave
[06:12] you i mentioned that
[06:14] high frequency trading algorithms
[06:17] will use
[06:18] market structure on a three minute two
[06:19] minute and one minute chart many times
[06:22] sub one minute that would be like
[06:25] 45 second
[06:26] 30 second 15 second intervals
[06:29] okay
[06:31] what the algorithms are actually doing
[06:34] and
[06:35] this is also going to correct a lot of
[06:36] people out there because they put out
[06:39] misinformation it's so nonsensical but
[06:42] i'm challenging you to go into your
[06:44] charts and see if this is not what's
[06:45] actually going on because it happens
[06:47] every day if high frequency algorithms
[06:49] are operating every single day then
[06:51] these signatures will be in the chart
[06:54] okay
[06:56] if you look at this short term high here
[06:59] right before this low formed
[07:01] when this
[07:02] high is taken out right there on that
[07:04] candle
[07:05] that's significant
[07:07] only
[07:08] only
[07:09] if this run down here
[07:12] has traded into
[07:14] sell stops
[07:16] okay below an old love some kind it
[07:18] could be a
[07:19] a double bottom it could be a single low
[07:21] okay but it's got to be trading under
[07:24] some
[07:26] retail idea that would be viewed as
[07:28] support
[07:31] up here the same thing
[07:33] we're trading above
[07:35] highs
[07:36] so we know that above old highs
[07:40] a neophyte perspective will be
[07:43] these are unknown orders so therefore
[07:45] that's a flawed perspective on price
[07:47] action how do you know there's liquidity
[07:48] up there how do you know there's buy
[07:50] stops up there it's just logic
[07:51] it's simple look at the chart
[07:53] everybody's trying to do something based
[07:56] on some kind of
[07:57] theory logic whatever some system
[08:01] there's buyers and sellers coming in at
[08:03] all times
[08:05] their buying and selling quote unquote
[08:07] strength or pressure has absolutely no
[08:10] bearing
[08:11] on where these prices are going to go
[08:13] i know that
[08:15] may shake individuals that think they
[08:17] know something about the markets oh i
[08:18] have an uncle that used to be on the
[08:20] floor of the chicago board of trade and
[08:21] blah blah blah the mercantile exchange
[08:23] guys say this i don't care okay i don't
[08:26] care what any of those folks say because
[08:28] they didn't design the algorithm
[08:31] so
[08:33] again
[08:34] put all those
[08:35] you know talking points and everybody
[08:37] else's opinion you've adopted because
[08:39] you probably heard someone else talk
[08:40] about it
[08:41] and you subscribe to the review because
[08:43] it's easier just to do that instead of
[08:44] going and looking at it for yourself and
[08:46] that's what i'm asking you to do
[08:48] i'm telling you this is my personal
[08:51] belief
[08:53] you're going to see proof of these
[08:55] things
[08:56] in a live account execution
[08:58] but i want you to see the logic behind
[09:00] it because if you can see this
[09:02] you'll be light years ahead of everyone
[09:04] else
[09:05] and you'll laugh
[09:06] in the face of all these people that are
[09:08] going to tell you you're wasting your
[09:09] time trying to learn this i promise you
[09:12] this lesson is going to change a lot for
[09:14] you
[09:17] when this
[09:18] run above these relative equal highs
[09:20] happens right there you're anticipating
[09:24] a market structure shift you're not
[09:26] forcing it
[09:27] you're not trying to get ahead of it
[09:30] okay i don't think any of you are going
[09:32] to have the skill set to do that there
[09:34] are ways to know when to sell short
[09:35] right above that not even wait for the
[09:37] shift in market structure
[09:39] just like there's ways to know to be a
[09:41] buyer down here without seeing that
[09:43] short term high broken
[09:45] then looking for a buy
[09:48] over here the opposite see this swing
[09:50] low
[09:52] let me go back to this for a second
[09:54] we have this high
[09:56] on this candle then we have the candle
[09:58] right after that here the highest one
[10:00] and then the lower
[10:01] high of this candle here so that's a
[10:03] swing high
[10:04] very simple little pattern but it means
[10:07] a lot when it's in the proper context
[10:10] when this high is broken with this
[10:13] particular candle right there that is
[10:15] significant only on the basis that we
[10:17] have taken liquidity out of the
[10:18] marketplace
[10:20] that's it
[10:21] so when it broke this short term high
[10:23] this is more meaningful
[10:25] and then the market will start to seek
[10:28] buy stops
[10:29] okay or buy side liquidity that would
[10:32] rest above here
[10:34] here
[10:35] and here now i shared an example of live
[10:38] executions and i was teaching on the
[10:39] idea of
[10:41] utilizing micros which are essentially
[10:44] two dollars per handle okay
[10:47] so or 50 cents per tick
[10:50] this chart is nasdaq e-mini this would
[10:53] represent twenty dollars
[10:55] per handle and there's four ticks in
[10:57] each handle there's your twenty dollars
[10:59] per handle okay so again what that means
[11:01] is fourteen six eighty to fourteen six
[11:04] eighty one that's one handle or four
[11:06] ticks
[11:09] there are some
[11:11] that will doubt the idea that you can
[11:13] trade all these little
[11:14] internal
[11:16] swings
[11:17] okay and i'm going to give you some
[11:18] insights on
[11:19] how i was doing it okay the main
[11:22] context of this lesson is for you to go
[11:25] in
[11:26] to your charts and try to prove me wrong
[11:31] okay
[11:32] that's the challenge here that's your
[11:33] homework i want you
[11:35] to learn what i'm doing in this lesson
[11:37] here
[11:38] and then you go into your charts back
[11:40] testing and i'll show you what that
[11:41] looks like what does it mean to be back
[11:42] testing and what you're looking for and
[11:44] how you're going to screen capture all
[11:45] those things but your
[11:48] mission is to go into the charts
[11:51] and look for this not being true
[11:54] okay this is exactly what i did on baby
[11:57] pips back in 2010
[12:00] i told everybody do not take my word for
[12:01] it
[12:02] don't take my word for it go into the
[12:05] charts and see if this is true or not i
[12:07] believe it
[12:08] but i don't want to try to convince you
[12:10] because i won't
[12:12] you'll convince yourself once you start
[12:14] seeing it
[12:15] it's it it's over there's no argument
[12:17] after that okay but it's simple logic
[12:20] very simple this is a very clean chart
[12:21] is it not
[12:25] all i'm going to do is add a few
[12:26] annotations and this is about as
[12:28] extensive
[12:30] of lipstick we put on our chart
[12:33] i know it's shocking right
[12:35] can you still see the candles
[12:37] because it might be a little obstructive
[12:40] i'm being facetious you see these guys
[12:42] out there with these charts that have
[12:43] graffiti all over it you can't even see
[12:44] the price candle nothing you can't you
[12:46] can't see any of it
[12:48] but there's all kinds of overlays of all
[12:50] kinds of nonsense which means absolutely
[12:52] nothing because algorithms could care
[12:53] less about any of that stuff triangles
[12:56] harmonic this
[12:57] crabs
[12:59] it's crazy i know but hey everybody's
[13:02] gotta have a religion
[13:04] so here's those
[13:05] cell stops
[13:07] so this little area here shaded in
[13:09] that's a
[13:10] area where cell stops would be residing
[13:12] below
[13:13] that 14 600 level okay on that 15 minute
[13:16] time frame
[13:18] so
[13:18] the market dove into that liquidity
[13:21] and you may or may not know that is a
[13:23] buy you don't need to
[13:26] you anticipate a
[13:28] shift in market structure
[13:29] when the market rallies above when does
[13:31] that happen on this candle right here
[13:32] see that little light bulb that's when
[13:34] you're thinking okay now i have a
[13:38] condition in the marketplace
[13:40] that i might see an opportunity intraday
[13:43] let's see if there's further evidence to
[13:45] that
[13:47] high is taken here we traded above it it
[13:50] does not need to close above that
[13:53] okay real important
[13:56] once that candle closes
[13:58] and this candle opens you're gonna
[14:01] monitor this candle and you want to see
[14:03] as soon as this candle closes does it
[14:04] create that fair value gap
[14:08] if it creates a fair value gap again
[14:10] that's a candle with a high one single
[14:12] pass up
[14:13] next candle has a load it doesn't
[14:14] completely overlap all this
[14:16] that's a fair value real simple okay
[14:19] this candle is where you would look to
[14:20] potentially trade at the earliest
[14:23] because now there's a gap there the
[14:24] market trades down into that
[14:26] boom takes off here is insight
[14:30] that everybody needs to understand
[14:32] because they're out here running around
[14:33] on youtube trying to teach order block
[14:35] theory
[14:36] order blocks
[14:38] okay i invented it it's mine
[14:41] no one talked about it before me and i
[14:43] first mentioned it in 2010 on baby pips
[14:46] prior to that 1996 i was only teaching
[14:48] it to people one-on-one in teachings
[14:50] that's it
[14:51] okay you can't find it in books prior to
[14:53] that it's mine
[14:55] no one else taught it before me it is
[14:57] mine so i'm going to correct all of you
[14:59] today so that way you can teach your
[15:01] people correctly and not hurt them
[15:04] see these down closed candles
[15:06] see that
[15:08] that's all one continuous order block
[15:12] what's it doing
[15:14] it's inside that pool of liquidity cell
[15:16] stops
[15:18] where's the open on that
[15:20] series of down closed candles right here
[15:23] that's the price level extending out in
[15:24] time boom
[15:27] so inside this fair value gap this
[15:29] opening price on the order block that's
[15:31] your buy
[15:32] plus
[15:33] three pips or whatever for spread
[15:35] and that's what you would use for a
[15:36] limit order
[15:38] hmm
[15:40] that's pretty neat in it
[15:42] well
[15:44] price starts to run where
[15:46] above the highs where by slots will be
[15:47] here
[15:48] above this high here
[15:51] and above this high here now go back and
[15:53] look at the example where
[15:55] this particular day here
[15:57] i put in orders
[15:59] and i was still learning how to use the
[16:02] thinkorswim platform and there's a
[16:04] little toggle box where if you toggle it
[16:07] it'll send your order right to the
[16:08] marketplace it won't let you review it
[16:10] and i had put that on to see if it was
[16:12] going to show me any kind of information
[16:14] on the screen but i didn't take it off
[16:16] so what happened was i put that on it
[16:18] was actually an order that i
[16:20] mistakenly had in so i was hoping to see
[16:22] if it could
[16:23] give me an opportunity to get out of it
[16:25] and cover with next to nothing or maybe
[16:26] even squeak out a profit it wasn't
[16:28] having it so i had to reverse and go
[16:30] back and go short
[16:31] wrote it down and then
[16:33] you'll see me covering in here and then
[16:36] going long
[16:37] selling short
[16:38] reversing going short
[16:40] buying long in here
[16:42] inside the order block rallied up
[16:44] sold the long reversed it
[16:47] bought it here
[16:48] got out over here and resold for that
[16:50] big run
[16:51] into that okay
[16:53] that's what i was doing there's people
[16:55] out there going to tell you he doesn't
[16:56] trade that way these people don't know
[16:58] how i'm trading you have no idea how i'm
[17:00] trading
[17:01] none of you do okay
[17:02] i'm teaching you
[17:04] obviously for those individuals that are
[17:06] outside my paid mentorship which is not
[17:08] open so please stop emailing asking
[17:10] people are still
[17:11] sending me emails can i join no you
[17:13] can't join be content with this i'm
[17:15] teaching you gold
[17:17] and it's costing you nothing but the
[17:18] time to sit down here
[17:20] and if it doesn't work you're going to
[17:21] know right away
[17:23] okay i'm not wasting your time
[17:25] i'm going right into the brass tacks
[17:27] that way the people that are weak minded
[17:29] will know right away this is it or it's
[17:31] not that way you'll know this is too
[17:33] much work for you
[17:34] and that's fine go and do whatever you
[17:35] got to do and i wish you good luck but
[17:37] the individuals that really put the time
[17:39] in and test what i'm
[17:41] challenging to look for you're going to
[17:43] see it's there and it repeats like
[17:45] clockwork okay it's real important you
[17:47] have that mindset
[17:49] so the buy stops
[17:51] above here that was taken
[17:53] this swing low forms once this candle
[17:55] closes so this candle we're watching
[17:57] does it go below that short term low it
[17:59] does
[18:00] so now we have a shift in market
[18:01] structure that is now bearish only
[18:03] because we've taken buy stops
[18:06] okay
[18:08] if everybody got forms the market
[18:10] rallies up into that you go short there
[18:13] what are you looking for
[18:17] below here sell stops below here cell
[18:20] stops below here cell stops and in this
[18:22] fair bay gap here
[18:24] so if you are in a position that has
[18:27] multiple contracts or say you have
[18:30] a forex trade because this works in
[18:32] forex too it's not just limited to
[18:34] futures
[18:35] again i'm just using this asset class
[18:36] because i cut my teeth on these markets
[18:39] when everybody else was still in
[18:41] elementary school that's trying to teach
[18:42] today i was trading the s p
[18:44] okay i probably sound like a young guy
[18:47] but i'm actually getting turned 50. so
[18:49] i've been around for a long time 30
[18:50] years this november 5th 30 years that's
[18:53] three decades
[18:55] and the things i'm teaching you i'm not
[18:56] teaching you one trick pony
[18:59] insight these things work on all asset
[19:01] classes now i'm not going to co-sign the
[19:04] crypto markets because that
[19:06] only my students are reporting that this
[19:08] stuff works there i don't even mess
[19:10] around with it that much then though
[19:11] okay
[19:12] but
[19:13] you can take partials
[19:15] below here i probably wouldn't do it
[19:16] there but below here
[19:18] here and there's something you're saying
[19:20] why wouldn't you take them below their
[19:21] ict well if you're trying to get short
[19:23] here that's not really that much
[19:24] movement so if you're going to take some
[19:26] thing off your trade below that low why
[19:28] not just try to reach for that one and
[19:30] you could get it there right here okay
[19:32] and then although that low is nice as
[19:34] well
[19:35] below this low and this is what i
[19:37] mentioned on the first
[19:38] lesson
[19:39] okay elements to a trade setup
[19:42] this is
[19:43] below the 50
[19:45] level of this high
[19:47] and that low okay so 50 level that's
[19:50] what we targeting now
[19:52] this candle's low was the high end or
[19:55] first objective
[19:57] inside this gap
[19:58] so that's your target you're gonna look
[20:00] for that
[20:01] so
[20:02] you're looking for low hanging fruit the
[20:04] easiest target to get to you're not
[20:05] trying to be perfect and you grow into
[20:07] eventually holding to see if it will
[20:09] fill in that gap
[20:10] okay this very very always going down to
[20:12] this candle is high
[20:15] that's
[20:17] something that you
[20:18] strive for over time
[20:22] if
[20:24] you understand what i just showed you
[20:25] here
[20:26] that's a very simple process of looking
[20:28] for number one liquidity
[20:30] gauging what happens without having to
[20:33] know for certain because you don't know
[20:35] you're not going to know until the
[20:37] market shows its hand this is it showing
[20:40] its hand
[20:45] okay that's it
[20:47] now
[20:49] let's go into a one-minute chart and see
[20:50] how that looks a little bit different
[20:52] but still has the same characteristics
[20:55] here's that same price structure
[20:58] just on a one-minute chart
[21:00] the same logic still there right
[21:02] swing high taken after liquidity has
[21:04] been traded into
[21:06] this short-term high
[21:08] it's violated right when this trades
[21:10] down in here what's actually occurring
[21:12] okay put this in your notes
[21:15] high frequency algorithms are hammering
[21:18] they're just throwing orders in bye bye
[21:21] bye bye bye that is not okay here's an
[21:23] important thing that is not causing
[21:26] okay it's not causing
[21:29] the market to go higher
[21:33] it's just
[21:35] volume that's coming in
[21:38] the algorithms that deliver price
[21:41] that offer price they're constantly
[21:43] offering the price in the marketplace
[21:46] that's what's beginning to spool and go
[21:49] higher okay and regardless of where you
[21:51] want to trade at your limit orders they
[21:53] may not get filled
[21:54] where you're trying to buy with a market
[21:56] order
[21:57] you may think you're getting in at 14 62
[22:01] but by the time your order is executed
[22:03] and confirmed you're in 14 664.
[22:07] that's slippage
[22:09] okay that's negative slippage if you
[22:10] were trying to buy it at 14 62
[22:13] and it filled you at 14 661 that's
[22:16] positive slippage that's better than
[22:17] what you were expecting
[22:18] so
[22:21] when price starts to rally
[22:23] all this is is a default to
[22:26] the algorithm constantly offering price
[22:28] at a higher price
[22:30] okay and the logic and argument for
[22:32] anyone who wants to say oh it's buying
[22:34] selling pressure this guy has no idea
[22:35] he's talking about i know somebody that
[22:36] used to trade on the floor and he's
[22:38] laughing at ict right now okay
[22:40] go into your charts forget that i'll
[22:42] i'll let you have that
[22:44] perspective for a moment for the
[22:45] argument but go into the charts
[22:47] and see if what i'm not suggesting to
[22:49] you is the truth okay
[22:52] i could sit here and do a complete
[22:54] series on all the things that lead to
[22:56] what i'm saying is true
[22:58] but none of you will still believe it
[22:59] i'm showing a live account and entries
[23:01] and executions and they're still
[23:03] doubting it
[23:04] so no matter what i do there's going to
[23:05] be people out there but you didn't do it
[23:07] wearing orange
[23:09] you didn't do it in your corvette did
[23:11] you flip which i don't flip corvettes
[23:14] you're getting all kinds of stuff out
[23:15] there nonsense
[23:16] but you don't see anybody going into
[23:18] that robin's cup
[23:20] hello
[23:22] so
[23:23] we're looking at the
[23:25] swing lower here
[23:27] market breaks down trades back back up
[23:29] into this back up atmosphere you got
[23:30] here
[23:32] and sells off there's another favorite
[23:33] you got right there trades up into that
[23:35] as well this is a one minute chart so
[23:37] it's giving you multiple
[23:40] points of execution that you could trade
[23:42] on
[23:43] and then
[23:44] dives
[23:46] see these two candles here
[23:48] that's one consecutive bearish order
[23:50] block
[23:52] the opening price
[23:54] extended out in time
[23:55] why is this a good a bearish order block
[23:57] because it has that gap
[24:00] and it's taken liquidity
[24:03] and there's a market structure shift
[24:06] there's your height frequency high power
[24:08] high probability bearish order block
[24:10] forget everybody else's
[24:13] interpretation of my concept the order
[24:16] block
[24:17] that's it
[24:18] okay what is an older block you do you
[24:21] see a lot of people asking what is an
[24:22] order block
[24:23] only my students and mentorship know
[24:25] what an order block is okay what it is
[24:28] it's just change in the state of
[24:29] delivery
[24:30] okay it's a change in the state
[24:34] of delivery
[24:36] the market's being offered higher higher
[24:38] higher in these two up close candles
[24:40] how did this series of up close candles
[24:43] begin with this candle's opening right
[24:45] there
[24:47] that opening
[24:48] once this candle trades below it
[24:52] that changes the state of delivery so
[24:55] you go back to that point of reference
[24:56] right there
[24:58] and that's why it's sensitive the
[24:59] algorithm remembers that right there
[25:02] okay that's all i'm going to give you on
[25:04] the free mentorship level but that is
[25:06] your answer
[25:07] okay that is what an order block is it
[25:09] is a change in the state of delivery
[25:11] much in the same way all of this
[25:13] movement down here all these down closed
[25:15] candles the opening on that candle
[25:17] starts this series of delivery on the
[25:18] downside
[25:19] when that opening price gets violated
[25:21] here
[25:23] it changes its state of delivery now it
[25:24] was offering
[25:26] sell side
[25:28] when it goes above that opening now it's
[25:30] offering buy side what will it be doing
[25:33] after that it will be looking for buy
[25:35] stops buy stops buy stops because it's
[25:38] offering buy side liquidity
[25:41] see you guys don't even know what you're
[25:42] talking about you're trying to teach my
[25:44] concepts
[25:45] and you have no idea what you're doing
[25:46] you're talking about things in the left
[25:47] side of the chart
[25:49] trade it
[25:50] do it okay
[25:53] you don't even know what you're looking
[25:54] at
[25:55] and you're hurting the people you call
[25:56] your students
[25:58] and then right away when people
[26:00] don't know how to use them or understand
[26:02] what to do with them
[26:03] they'll say well this stuff doesn't work
[26:05] because they learn from someone who
[26:06] doesn't know what they're doing
[26:08] okay
[26:09] it's it's blatantly obvious what it is
[26:11] but okay
[26:13] same thing here
[26:14] buy side is being offered until that
[26:17] opening price is violated right there
[26:18] then the change of state of delivery
[26:20] occurs now the market's going to be
[26:21] doing what
[26:23] offering sell side liquidity what's that
[26:25] mean it's going to start going lower and
[26:27] attacking the sell stops all the sell
[26:29] sell equity it's offering it to the
[26:30] marketplace that's what's happening
[26:32] that's what the algorithm is doing
[26:34] that's what the algorithm does okay you
[26:37] buying and selling me buying and selling
[26:38] everybody over there on reddit is not
[26:40] going to change
[26:42] anything
[26:43] at all it's not going to do anything
[26:47] and the argument that defeats all that
[26:49] buying and selling pressure is how do
[26:52] you argue against the bull squeeze and
[26:55] the bear squeeze there's a short squeeze
[26:57] going on the market's rallying up when
[26:59] it's been bearish
[27:01] that's just their cop-out that's their
[27:02] way of saying well you know
[27:05] everybody shorten and now they're
[27:07] covering so there it is and i learned
[27:09] the same thing folks i believed all that
[27:10] garbage
[27:11] two thousand plus books i know
[27:14] what those books told me is what you are
[27:16] learning too
[27:17] because the same people teaching today
[27:19] retail garbage
[27:21] elliott wave this and that
[27:24] it's all stupid stuff man it has nothing
[27:26] to do with why these markets are doing
[27:27] what they're doing
[27:28] zero has nothing to do with it
[27:31] don't worry i got proof
[27:32] today but the market goes down to that
[27:34] 50 level because it's going down to what
[27:37] i teach you what did i say in the first
[27:38] video
[27:39] it's going down from a premium
[27:42] market
[27:44] relative to this low and this high
[27:46] 50 is here that's equilibrium so it's
[27:48] going to go down to a discount and
[27:50] that's that gap right in here it doesn't
[27:51] look like a gap so much here but if you
[27:53] go back up one more time
[27:55] that's that single opening right there
[27:58] on a two-minute chart and then on a
[27:59] one-minute chart it's two candles that
[28:01] make that up but you're gonna have to do
[28:03] is go through a progression of going
[28:04] from the three minute two minute and one
[28:06] minute chart and you'll get your market
[28:08] structure and your
[28:09] areas of where it wants to look for an
[28:10] imbalance or overload high and it just
[28:13] makes it easy
[28:15] but just a real nice delivery there
[28:20] and here's the lipstick on it on the one
[28:22] minute chart
[28:24] swing high is broken
[28:27] market structure is now bullish
[28:30] rallies
[28:32] taking buy stops taking buy stops taking
[28:35] buy stops
[28:36] this right here these highs right here
[28:38] is just staying below that low it's
[28:40] building up
[28:42] more interest that this is what
[28:44] resistance
[28:46] that is engineering liquidity
[28:48] that way
[28:50] when this runs above it
[28:51] those individuals that know what you're
[28:53] learning today they know that that's a
[28:55] pool of liquidity for buyers coming in
[28:57] at a high price why is that useful
[28:59] because smart money that bought down
[29:01] here or here or here or here or here
[29:07] that's where they sell
[29:09] to high
[29:10] seeking
[29:11] buyers
[29:15] it's not hard logic folks it's not
[29:17] complicated
[29:18] okay it just feels complicated because
[29:19] you see other people trying to teach
[29:21] something and you hear or read in the
[29:22] comments you're teaching it better than
[29:24] ict does no you don't
[29:26] [Laughter]
[29:27] no you're not you're not doing you're
[29:29] actually teaching it incorrectly and
[29:31] without the real context of what it is
[29:34] that you're missing
[29:36] but i get it you think every down closed
[29:38] candle is a bullish order block and up
[29:40] claim that one is a very short block and
[29:42] that's not the case
[29:44] look in here
[29:45] okay for the guys that say i did not
[29:47] take trades or i didn't trade this way
[29:50] see that gap right there see that see
[29:52] that down closed candle right there
[29:53] that's your order block boom by it right
[29:55] there
[29:56] what about this
[29:58] right here
[29:59] dropping down
[30:01] all these candles here
[30:03] are more
[30:04] significant if you look at it on the two
[30:06] minute chart
[30:09] see that it becomes one order block
[30:13] right in here
[30:15] buy it sell short buy it again
[30:18] we got up into the stops
[30:20] sell short reverse and ride the larger
[30:23] swing down
[30:25] don't listen these yahoos out there to
[30:27] say that i'm not proving something to
[30:29] you i'm proving it that's what i said i
[30:30] was going to come out here this year and
[30:31] do that's this whole point of being here
[30:34] this year
[30:35] it's my 30th anniversary
[30:37] november 5th
[30:38] i've been a trader
[30:40] in the markets
[30:41] living and breathing this stuff for 30
[30:43] years
[30:45] you're not
[30:48] really in any position to demand
[30:50] anything from me i enjoy doing this
[30:53] but i don't need to provide any kind of
[30:54] proof to you either but i'm loving it
[30:56] this year
[30:57] i'm
[30:58] slowly putting it out there and enjoying
[31:00] all the naysayers and the things they're
[31:02] saying
[31:03] and it's just fun because they have no
[31:05] idea what i'm about to bring this entire
[31:07] year
[31:08] none of you are going to doubt anything
[31:12] so the one-minute chart
[31:15] just a real nice delivery here as well
[31:18] filling in that very value you got
[31:21] change in the state of delivery
[31:23] now it's offering sell side what's that
[31:25] mean it's going to match up
[31:27] sell stops it's going to keep going
[31:29] below old lows
[31:32] into an imbalance until we get down to a
[31:34] discount
[31:37] is that hard
[31:38] is it hard to see
[31:40] what i'm showing you here
[31:43] pretty clean isn't it clean chart now i
[31:45] don't have all these things
[31:48] on my chart when i'm watching price
[31:49] because i already know what i'm looking
[31:50] for
[31:51] and i don't want to have any
[31:52] distractions and i don't want to have
[31:54] a level or some kind of annotation
[31:56] that's going to keep me thinking only
[31:58] with that perspective okay or that idea
[32:01] it allows me to be fluid
[32:04] with
[32:05] what the market's actually doing
[32:07] versus going in and saying okay this is
[32:09] what i think is going to happen and this
[32:10] is the only thing that can happen
[32:13] you understand what i just did there
[32:15] i allow myself to be flexible whereas if
[32:17] you have all these things you're putting
[32:18] on your chart
[32:20] you're only
[32:22] only seeing your will be done
[32:26] so i keep my charts
[32:28] clean
[32:30] and then i add the annotations so that
[32:31] way my students can see
[32:33] what the internal dialogue in my mind
[32:35] was while watching price do what it does
[32:38] naked there's nothing on the charts at
[32:40] all when i'm trading zero nothing okay
[32:44] so with that
[32:46] i want you to think about
[32:49] how this is useful okay
[32:52] number one
[32:53] you're looking at
[32:55] london highs and lows the session for
[32:58] london
[32:59] open okay for instance like two o'clock
[33:01] in the morning at five o'clock in the
[33:01] morning
[33:02] new york time every time i tell you just
[33:05] always set it
[33:06] with new york local time
[33:08] two o'clock to five o'clock in the
[33:09] morning that's your london session
[33:11] what's the highs and lows of that
[33:12] session okay
[33:14] that's important because the market's
[33:15] going to probably sweep above those
[33:17] highs or sweep below those lows and
[33:19] create situations like this okay
[33:22] and the new york session is seven
[33:25] o'clock in the morning to 10 o'clock in
[33:27] the morning new york local time okay
[33:28] what's the session high and low for that
[33:31] and do the same thing for asia okay 7
[33:34] p.m to
[33:36] 9 p.m
[33:38] and that's it those are the three times
[33:40] of the day that i'm looking for specific
[33:42] key highs and kilos
[33:44] and
[33:45] any intraday high and low forming right
[33:48] before the equities open at 9 30.
[33:51] pretty easy right the hours of operation
[33:53] again are generally between 8 30 in the
[33:55] morning until 11 but it can be extended
[33:58] to new york lunch noon i do not
[34:01] tend to
[34:02] take trades after
[34:04] noon local time in new york that hour is
[34:07] usually very problematic and it just
[34:10] it's better not to even look for any
[34:11] kind of setups wait until one o'clock
[34:13] preferably really 1 30
[34:15] to 4 o'clock then you get that afternoon
[34:17] trend
[34:18] typically you'll see between two o'clock
[34:21] and three o'clock there's a setup that
[34:22] usually forms in the afternoon trend or
[34:24] set up in that period of the time of the
[34:26] day
[34:28] that will also offer opportunities but
[34:30] that's outside the scope of what i'm
[34:31] going to be teaching in this mentorship
[34:33] but there's lots of things you can look
[34:35] on youtube about the afternoon session
[34:37] and you can just combine some of the
[34:39] things that i'm going to teach you here
[34:41] and just it's not hard to make a
[34:43] you know an addition to
[34:45] what you're learning here so if you want
[34:46] to trade the afternoon session you can
[34:48] obviously pick up some insights from
[34:50] other youtubers that do trade futures
[34:52] but
[34:54] for developing students this is enough i
[34:56] promise you this is enough okay
[35:02] all right so we talked about internal
[35:03] range liquidity
[35:04] and internal range liquidity is looking
[35:07] for
[35:08] short-term lows or short-term highs
[35:10] inside a price leg that we're retracing
[35:13] back into okay that's all it means
[35:15] internal range liquidity is a short term
[35:18] higher low with stops above or below it
[35:20] or an imbalance in that same
[35:23] range of price action
[35:25] and i taught you market structure shifts
[35:27] showed you exactly all that's necessary
[35:31] that is all that you require
[35:33] and the skill set of identifying pools
[35:36] of liquidity
[35:37] that is going to be something you learn
[35:39] rather quickly just by going through old
[35:41] data and looking at the times of the day
[35:42] i gave you in this lecture all right
[35:44] your homework is you're going to go
[35:45] through your e-mini futures intraday
[35:47] charts
[35:48] and you'll be looking for stop hunts
[35:50] that lead to market structure shifts
[35:51] intraday you're going to log your
[35:53] examples with your own annotations for
[35:55] your study journal
[35:56] so what i showed with the break in the
[35:59] market going higher and lower above
[36:02] old highs or lower below an old low
[36:05] that's running for stops that's a stop
[36:07] hunt
[36:09] then you're looking for that signature
[36:10] for the market structure shift on the
[36:13] three two and or one minute charts okay
[36:16] if you look for that between 8 30 in the
[36:18] morning to noon new york local time
[36:20] in the e-mini markets or if you're
[36:23] watching the micro markets
[36:26] the same logic exists okay but you're
[36:28] going to start going back from today
[36:31] and go back as far as the data will
[36:33] allow you the more you do it and you
[36:36] annotate your charts the more experience
[36:38] you're going to have and it's pseudo
[36:40] experience yes but you're teaching your
[36:42] brain i use this analogy a lot with my
[36:44] paid mentorship students
[36:47] it's like hunters okay
[36:50] to know where you're gonna find a deer
[36:52] if that's what you're going to go out
[36:53] and hunt you need to know how to track
[36:55] one okay or sit up in this tree stand
[36:57] and wait for it to walk by but usually
[36:59] they go out and they walk around in the
[37:00] woods and look for tracks
[37:02] would you know what a deer track looks
[37:04] like before i was shown one i didn't
[37:06] know what it was okay but
[37:08] because i'm showing you what it looks
[37:10] like that's all this lesson was
[37:11] predominantly focusing on is the
[37:14] actual
[37:16] view of what it looks like the details
[37:19] what you don't need is anything above
[37:22] and beyond what i've shown you
[37:23] the only thing you need is what i've
[37:25] shown you here it's simple it's straight
[37:27] to the point
[37:29] and i'm only talking to that way you
[37:31] understand
[37:32] that this is all that is required
[37:35] notice there is no commitment of traders
[37:38] notice there's no breakers notice that
[37:41] i've stripped it down to the chrome now
[37:43] this is the only way you can trade but
[37:45] i'm showing you something that i think
[37:46] personally is in my opinion this is so
[37:48] universally simplistic
[37:51] all of you should be able to do this one
[37:53] okay in my opinion i think this is it
[37:55] and that's why i
[37:57] more or less built it because i think my
[37:59] daughter which has zero interest in
[38:01] trading
[38:02] i think that this is going to be easy
[38:04] for her to see it and understand what to
[38:06] look for it doesn't have a lot of moving
[38:07] parts notice that it's very specific
[38:09] times of the day specific highs and lows
[38:12] you're going to look for
[38:14] it's simple
[38:15] but you won't appreciate how simple it
[38:17] is until you go back into your charts
[38:20] and you annotate your 15-minute time
[38:21] frame for your
[38:23] buy-side liquidity pool and your
[38:24] sell-side liquidity pools
[38:26] and then going down into the
[38:28] three-minute two-minute moment chart so
[38:30] for every individual day that you're
[38:32] logging
[38:33] and you're back testing back testing is
[38:34] just dressing your chart up like i'm
[38:36] showing you here
[38:38] and then studying it not just do it say
[38:40] okay i'm done really going to see how
[38:42] price moved and how it delivered
[38:45] how many pips did it move
[38:47] how long did it move going higher or
[38:49] lower
[38:51] how much drawdown did it put on your
[38:52] position if you would have taken one
[38:54] all of those things you want to annotate
[38:56] that in your chart so that way when you
[38:57] go back through your study journal
[39:00] you'll have many examples that look at
[39:02] and because you're looking at it and
[39:04] you're seeing it over and over again
[39:06] repetitively
[39:08] when you have a period of time where
[39:10] nothing feels like it's working and you
[39:12] feel confused you want to go back
[39:13] through your study journal and look at
[39:14] these examples because it will encourage
[39:16] you through periods of time where you
[39:18] just feel like it isn't clicking okay
[39:20] it's why it's important to have a study
[39:21] journal because you're going to see this
[39:22] stuff is happening every single day
[39:26] every single day and don't
[39:29] take the infancy that you have right now
[39:33] and the lack of experience
[39:35] and amplify that to there's no way i can
[39:38] learn how to do this because that's a
[39:39] lie that's a facade don't buy into that
[39:42] view okay it's something that you're
[39:44] going to have to grow into and it's
[39:46] going to be quick for some and it's
[39:47] going to be slower for others and
[39:49] there's no way i can make it easier than
[39:51] this okay because that workload that you
[39:53] have to go through of back testing and
[39:55] logging and acquiring examples the more
[39:58] time you do that
[40:00] the more examples you acquire in back
[40:01] testing i swear this is the secret okay
[40:05] because that is the thing
[40:07] that's the work that's required
[40:10] a lot of people say they do it but they
[40:12] don't okay they go back a couple days
[40:14] and say oh this is i don't think i'm
[40:16] getting anything from this
[40:18] but that's the reason why they fail
[40:20] because that's the work that's required
[40:22] you know having 10 pages in a notebook
[40:24] saying i took notes and you didn't take
[40:26] notes you scribbled you wasted your time
[40:28] you knew going in you weren't going to
[40:29] be that
[40:31] headstrong about doing it and that's
[40:33] what is required to learn this otherwise
[40:35] if you don't have that mindset this
[40:37] isn't going to be for you because it's
[40:38] going to require work it's going to take
[40:40] effort and organization and personal
[40:42] responsibility if you don't have those
[40:44] characteristics you need to develop them
[40:46] if you don't develop them and patients
[40:49] you must go out there and find somebody
[40:51] that's good at giving you trade signals
[40:53] and just submit to that
[40:55] and you good luck with it
[40:58] but this isn't it i got another portion
[41:00] of the video i want to show you now and
[41:01] i'm going to show you this logic
[41:02] actually working today in the nasdaq
[41:04] e-mini contract
[41:06] all right so we're looking at
[41:08] trading views chart in the backdrop and
[41:11] i have
[41:12] the td ameritrade
[41:15] open over top of it scrunched down so
[41:17] that way i can
[41:18] operate with the trading view and i'm
[41:20] going to highlight in trading view
[41:23] a fair value got after a market
[41:25] structure shift it's bullish
[41:28] and i'm going to show you an imbalance
[41:29] that is in a premium
[41:33] okay see that just the opposite of what
[41:35] i've been showing you
[41:38] change the color on this
[41:42] and the idea is i want to see it drop
[41:44] down into that green area but if you
[41:46] look real close there's actually a
[41:48] smaller little fair value got just below
[41:51] that green box okay this is not supply
[41:54] and demand okay
[41:56] the idea is i want to see it
[41:59] drop down to that green box
[42:01] and i don't know if it's going to dip
[42:03] into the lower fare value cap so
[42:04] whenever there's two fair value gaps
[42:06] like this this is for your notes in case
[42:07] you missed this
[42:09] the idea is
[42:10] i'm going to let it trade down to that
[42:12] lower one i'll sacrifice that
[42:14] better entry and if it trades down there
[42:17] and trades into it
[42:18] and then comes right back up into that
[42:19] green box the first higher fair value
[42:21] gap i'll enter when it's in there
[42:24] and expect that the lower one won't be
[42:26] retraded to okay
[42:30] i'm going to be trading with
[42:32] a stop that will have
[42:34] essentially three and a quarter percent
[42:36] risk
[42:37] i'm not suggesting that's a size of risk
[42:39] for you i'm just telling you that's what
[42:41] i have in mind when i'm taking this
[42:42] trade
[42:44] and this is again just my personal
[42:46] belief in this i'm not suggesting that
[42:48] you should believe me or you subscribe
[42:51] to this view because i'm showing you a
[42:53] live account this does not mean that
[42:55] every trade you take forward from this
[42:57] day on is going to be like this it
[42:59] doesn't mean it guarantees profit it
[43:00] doesn't but my belief in my faith is
[43:04] that i've seen this work so many times
[43:06] over the last 30 years that i know
[43:09] that this is something that's going to
[43:10] work
[43:11] enough for me
[43:12] and that's all that matters it's a
[43:13] personal endeavor when you're
[43:15] speculating
[43:17] if you don't have any faith in it then
[43:18] obviously you would never put live money
[43:21] in it
[43:24] all right so the market's starting to
[43:27] drop down a little bit in here
[43:29] and let's say for instance that it runs
[43:31] up into that
[43:33] upper rectangle first before going down
[43:35] to the green one then i would nix the
[43:37] trade and that means i wouldn't take a
[43:39] trade and i'd move to the sidelines and
[43:40] probably do nothing the rest of the
[43:42] morning or watch and see if there's
[43:43] something else that sets up
[43:46] all right so now i'm inside that
[43:47] rectangle but notice again
[43:49] i want to see if it goes down to that
[43:50] lower fair value gap that's not
[43:52] highlighted i'll mention it when we get
[43:53] into it
[43:57] that right there i'm willing to
[43:59] sacrifice that because that's actually
[44:00] the better buy
[44:04] but if we go back up into the higher
[44:06] fair value gap
[44:08] and create like a tail
[44:11] on this particular candle
[44:12] i'll see that as just running for a
[44:14] lower imbalance and then
[44:17] it should accumulate in here
[44:25] and i have my trigger on the buy button
[44:28] okay i'm just going to go in with a buy
[44:29] at market
[44:30] not trying to do anything
[44:33] advanced here
[44:40] okay and if you look at the bottom of
[44:42] the td ameritrade live account module
[44:45] you'll see nasdaq symbol and
[44:48] you'll actually see my profit loss going
[44:51] as the trade is entered
[44:54] and i took a trade in the e-mini s p and
[44:56] it was basically a scratch i ended up
[44:58] making 75
[44:59] so i put a trade on and
[45:02] came back on me stopped me and that was
[45:04] the end of that
[45:11] all right there i am
[45:13] putting the order in
[45:18] and there's the confirmation that the
[45:20] orders were received
[45:22] so now i'm long you can see at the
[45:25] bottom of the
[45:26] pop out
[45:28] it shows that i'm down
[45:30] initially
[45:32] what looks like 20 i know i'm up 20
[45:35] right now so
[45:36] now down 75.
[45:39] so this is the part of trading where it
[45:41] feels scary if you've never traded with
[45:44] live funds
[45:45] and you just feel like you got to watch
[45:47] that number of how much money you're
[45:49] making and losing that's the worst thing
[45:51] to do okay
[45:52] what i'm watching is
[45:54] the chart
[45:55] does the chart continuously
[45:57] keep giving me feedback
[45:59] visually that it's accumulating and not
[46:02] going lower
[46:03] now it can go one more time back into
[46:05] that lower fair value gap that's
[46:06] permissible to me i'm willing to endure
[46:09] that
[46:10] i just don't want to see it overlap that
[46:12] entire thing and go lower because then
[46:15] i'd have to close the trade and
[46:16] preferably save my stop
[46:21] notice the bodies of the candles are
[46:22] staying relatively inside that fair
[46:24] value got the shaded green
[46:27] now i again i'm only adding this
[46:29] to the chart because i knew i was going
[46:30] to record it and share it with you today
[46:33] but i do not have this in my charts
[46:35] okay the only annotations i have in my
[46:37] charts is when i'm teaching my students
[46:39] and since you're here
[46:41] at least for right now
[46:43] i'm calling you my student
[46:47] even the haters
[46:52] all right
[46:54] so with the
[46:56] aid of
[46:57] hindsight because i lived this moment
[46:59] this morning
[47:00] it does go down one more time
[47:02] and stab into
[47:04] those wicks that are forming
[47:26] now when you put a trade on
[47:29] you kind of like
[47:31] give the complete control of everything
[47:34] to the marketplace
[47:35] and you want to just allow the market to
[47:37] do what it's going to do and not try to
[47:39] overthink
[47:41] every fluctuation
[47:42] every little minor movement in the price
[47:45] action
[47:46] is
[47:47] not something that is going to hopefully
[47:50] sway you so i've already had it in my
[47:53] mind that it could go back down and make
[47:54] a slightly lower low than those two
[47:56] little wicks that it's formed inside the
[47:58] lower fair value gap
[48:01] so since i had that expectation that it
[48:03] could potentially do that
[48:06] i'm
[48:07] desensitizing myself to that in the
[48:10] event that it forms
[48:11] an ideal scenario would be it doesn't do
[48:13] it at all obviously but
[48:15] i'm allowing for that price action
[48:17] especially with the volatility that
[48:18] we've been seeing the last few days
[48:24] and what i'm thinking right now is
[48:25] they're taking it down one more time to
[48:27] accumulate more longs
[48:32] notice i'm saying that not it's selling
[48:34] pressure driving price down
[48:47] i think this uh
[48:49] this is where i took the most heat on
[48:50] the trade if i'm not mistaken i think
[48:52] it's like 455 dollars of
[48:55] trade drawdown while being still in the
[48:57] trade which is below the threshold i've
[49:00] already said
[49:05] my maximum risk
[49:07] on a trade if i'm trading competitively
[49:08] is four and a half percent per trade
[49:11] generally i like to take a trade that i
[49:13] feel comfortable with around three
[49:15] three and a half percent that's a good
[49:17] trade for me
[49:24] okay showing signs initially that it's
[49:26] wanting to go higher
[49:28] and what i'm trying to do is keep my
[49:30] focus on that lower
[49:32] level or the the bottom of that pink
[49:34] rectangle that's the low hanging fruit
[49:36] that's the easy target i'm telling you
[49:39] to try to practice and learn to reach
[49:40] for the ideal scenario would be to go
[49:43] all the way to the top of that pink
[49:45] but while you're learning don't do that
[49:48] okay
[49:49] it's easier just to let it trade the low
[49:52] end
[49:53] and just take it off when it gives it to
[49:55] you
[49:57] i have my trigger on the flatten button
[49:59] so it cancels every order
[50:01] takes me completely out of the
[50:02] marketplace
[50:07] as soon as it touches the low end of
[50:09] that rectangle
[50:11] i'll collapse the trade
[50:14] right now i'm up seven nine almost nine
[50:16] hundred dollars eight ninety five nine
[50:19] thirty five
[50:21] nine twenty five
[50:25] and again you can watch that fluctuation
[50:26] in the lower right hand corner of the
[50:29] pop out
[50:30] i'm at 1100 plus
[50:33] 11.49
[50:35] okay traded there touched it now i'm
[50:37] collapsing the trade there just like
[50:39] that and that's it
[50:41] now my account's booked and mark to
[50:43] market
[50:44] with eleven hundred
[50:47] ninety dollars and
[50:48] gain in the balance now reflects it with
[50:50] twenty seven thousand nine hundred
[50:51] fifteen dollars and eleven cents so
[50:53] there's trading view
[50:55] showing the chart i'm watching because i
[50:57] like trading these charts i don't like
[50:59] td ameritrades charts it's i don't like
[51:01] them so i'm just using the pop out which
[51:03] is why are you showing us things
[51:05] scrunched up you're just i'm not hiding
[51:06] anything you can see it it's right there
[51:09] so
[51:10] let's go over and take a look at the
[51:11] chart now
[51:13] you can see nothing has changed i just
[51:15] magnified that pop out so it's entirely
[51:18] taking up my entire screen
[51:22] we're gonna go to
[51:23] the nasdaq e-mini contract
[51:26] simple
[51:28] and i am so clumsy with this platform
[51:30] still
[51:36] and i'm sure i'll get real good at by
[51:38] the middle of the year and not nudge
[51:41] all right so we're gonna look at this
[51:43] day
[51:44] and there's the chart on one minute and
[51:47] i'm gonna add an overlay okay
[51:50] but i'm going to put in so you can see
[51:51] where the trades are
[51:55] in that chart there's the executions
[51:59] and there is these areas i showed you on
[52:02] the trading view chart
[52:03] so
[52:04] for the inquiring minds that wanted to
[52:05] see a live chart and live account and
[52:08] all that business and the logic of what
[52:10] i'm teaching in the youtube channel
[52:12] i humbly submit this
[52:14] and so i'll talk to you on
[52:16] thursday be safe
