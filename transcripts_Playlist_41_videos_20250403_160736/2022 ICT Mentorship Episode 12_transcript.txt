[00:04] all right folks welcome back I do hope
[00:06] everyone's doing
[00:08] well so we're looking at episode 12 this
[00:13] lesson and lecture is going to be on the
[00:15] topic of Market structure for precision
[00:18] technicians now admittedly going into
[00:20] this this is an advanced price action
[00:23] Theory you're going to have a lot of
[00:25] questions it's going to cause all kinds
[00:27] of anxiety for those that just feel like
[00:29] you have to learn it the first time you
[00:30] watch a video trust me you will not and
[00:35] you cannot learn this in one video okay
[00:38] this is actually going to be a lesson
[00:39] even my paid mentorship group has yet to
[00:42] see okay so I want to give you something
[00:45] that's fresh something that is deep that
[00:48] will allow you to go into your charts
[00:50] and start studying a little bit
[00:52] more
[00:54] well deeper than the normal higher high
[00:57] higher low idea that is made up of the
[01:01] retail view of Market
[01:07] structure all right here is the
[01:10] NASDAQ March contract for 2022 I already
[01:13] hear some of you already hissing and
[01:15] moaning the Forex traders in my group
[01:18] when are you ever going to talk about
[01:19] EUR
[01:21] dollar well let me remind you what I'm
[01:24] teaching Works in Forex okay it works in
[01:28] stocks it works in bonds
[01:32] it's up to you to decide what asset
[01:34] class you're going to work with Okay so
[01:35] I'm teaching price this is the asset
[01:38] class that's moving around nicely so I'm
[01:41] using it as a medium okay you could just
[01:44] as easily go into a Aussie dollar you
[01:48] know or pound Yen chart and you'll see
[01:49] these things happening as well okay
[01:53] trust me we'll get into Forex again okay
[01:56] I haven't abandoned forx I just want to
[01:57] mine this vein that's available in
[02:00] volatility right now with the index
[02:03] fatures all right so obviously we can
[02:05] see with the benefit of hindsight that
[02:08] the things we were looking for in price
[02:10] action has come to fruition we were
[02:13] looking for the Run below these lows in
[02:15] here we got that we were looking for a
[02:17] run and rebalance back up into this fair
[02:19] value Gap it did so handsomely broke
[02:22] lower overnight with all
[02:26] the wartime things that are going around
[02:30] the
[02:30] globe and you know what I'm referring to
[02:33] uh that caused a little bit of
[02:35] excitement on the downside and then
[02:38] we're back Above This short-term low I
[02:41] am not convinced at this point that we
[02:43] have made a low so that way we can put
[02:45] that the bed right now I'm not in the
[02:47] business of picking tops and bottoms so
[02:51] if you feel like you're going to go out
[02:52] there and do that just letting you know
[02:53] that I teach my PID group not to do that
[02:56] and I don't go out there actively trying
[02:58] to do that either but we're going to go
[03:01] into a deep dive of Market structure
[03:05] inside this area now before I do this I
[03:08] want you to understand this part this is
[03:10] the part that seems boring this is the
[03:12] part that gets the most complaints from
[03:14] those individuals that will never ever
[03:16] do well or succeed in this because they
[03:18] want five minute Trainers for something
[03:21] that's extremely Technical and you just
[03:24] can't strip it down to very
[03:27] easy ideas Okay so it's going to take a
[03:30] little bit of study thinking and
[03:32] homework of you going through old price
[03:34] data and you'll start seeing these
[03:36] things but I promise you this video will
[03:39] cause a light bulb movement for you and
[03:41] you'll start to see things that are in
[03:44] the charts all the time but you are not
[03:46] aware of it and it'll also allow you to
[03:51] go back into Old moves and see that this
[03:52] is in fact very true and you can use it
[03:55] to confirm or negate a price move I get
[04:00] a lot of questions through trading view
[04:03] people posting hey you can you answer
[04:06] this for me can you answer that for me I
[04:08] don't make it a business of doing that
[04:10] because I don't have a lot of time for
[04:11] it but I use those questions in these
[04:13] talking points in my lectures not only
[04:16] in this mentorship but in my private
[04:19] group
[04:22] so the questions I get a lot is how do I
[04:25] know if I'm going to sell above an old
[04:28] high how do I know it's not going to
[04:30] keep going higher well that's the
[04:33] underlying Market structure and the
[04:35] trust in the factors that I'm going to
[04:37] kind of like teach you
[04:40] tonight me teaching it to you is not
[04:43] going to transpose my trust that has to
[04:46] be developed in your learning curve it's
[04:50] going to take time how long is it going
[04:51] to take I don't know all of you are
[04:52] going to do it differently but you're
[04:54] going to arrive right on time exactly
[04:57] when you should that's when you're going
[04:58] to get it all okay and it's a matter of
[05:01] how much time and effort you put into
[05:02] studying
[05:03] it because these
[05:05] candlesticks you can make them say
[05:08] anything you want you beat on them and
[05:09] they'll submit to
[05:12] anything but you want to know what
[05:14] they're likely to be hinting at and I'm
[05:17] going to give you those Clues tonight
[05:20] but in here we're going to take a deep
[05:22] dive into that price action right
[05:27] there all right so we are looking inside
[05:31] that fair value gap on the daily chart
[05:32] this was the high end of that fair value
[05:34] Gap and this was the low end of that
[05:36] fair value Gap the time frame on this
[05:38] chart as you can see here 1 hour and
[05:43] I've
[05:44] outlined Market structure in the idea of
[05:48] long-term High long-term low short-term
[05:53] High short-term low and in between those
[05:56] two swing points there's an intermediate
[05:59] term High and an intermediate term
[06:03] low when we look at
[06:06] Price we're not looking for just the
[06:08] simple higher high higher low therefore
[06:11] it's a bullish Market or uptrend that
[06:13] that's not what I'm looking at I'm
[06:16] looking at does the market have a reason
[06:18] to go up for buy side liquidity or buy
[06:22] stopped or is it likely go up to
[06:25] rebalance an imbalance which is like a
[06:27] fair value G
[06:30] or is it likely to go lower to sweep out
[06:33] short-term
[06:34] lows for sell side liquidity or sell
[06:37] stops or is it likely to go down to
[06:40] rebalance and old inbalance or a fair
[06:43] value G below market
[06:46] price that
[06:48] is the number one question that I have
[06:51] before I sit down in front of my charts
[06:53] that's what I'm looking for what is the
[06:57] current market narrative
[07:00] what is it likely to be doing right now
[07:02] I don't care about patterns in price
[07:04] action I don't care about anything
[07:06] harmonic I'm not looking for any kind of
[07:08] Elliot waves I'm not looking for any
[07:11] kind of ratio idea I'm not looking for
[07:15] anything that you can attribute to a
[07:17] retail
[07:18] mindset nothing except for those two
[07:22] questions is it likely to go up for
[07:24] stops or go down for stops or is it
[07:27] going to go higher to rebalance or lower
[07:29] to rebalance
[07:30] balance now how do I
[07:34] arrive at that idea is is it going to go
[07:37] higher is it going to go lower because
[07:39] that kind of like leans on that question
[07:41] I told you many times if there's one
[07:43] question I get asked the most it's teach
[07:45] me bias in other words you want to know
[07:47] where's the market going next and that's
[07:50] good that's the next draw on liquidity
[07:54] but the daily range will not always
[07:56] submit to that bullish or bearish right
[07:59] from the opening go higher or rate from
[08:01] the opening go lower sometimes you'll
[08:02] have consolidation Inay and you may have
[08:05] been trying to take a trade that was
[08:08] based on an idea that you came to that
[08:11] would be bullish and maybe it did give
[08:14] you an opportunity to be in a trade that
[08:16] was profitable for a period of time but
[08:18] you held on to it thinking the daily
[08:19] range was going to keep on going higher
[08:21] and it turned on you these ideas I'm
[08:24] going to teach you in this lecture here
[08:27] will help you identify the likelihood
[08:29] that your idea is probably been proven
[08:32] inaccurate but you have to be receptive
[08:36] to the clues that price has given you
[08:38] that's the number one reason why I
[08:40] abandoned indicators and if you have
[08:42] anything on the
[08:44] charts that cover up
[08:47] candles or Draw your attention to
[08:49] something that you're putting on the
[08:51] chart and I call that you know
[08:52] factiously lipstick okay that's what
[08:55] this chart is showing here it's this
[08:56] lipstick it's me communicating how I am
[09:00] internalizing this price structure this
[09:02] fractal and price I'm looking at it with
[09:05] this idea now I'm looking at it in a
[09:08] matter of seconds I come to this
[09:09] conclusion I'm looking at the highs and
[09:11] I'm looking at the relationships between
[09:13] each swing High each swing low and I'm
[09:15] coming to a conclusion studying one
[09:18] swing at a time and I'm going to come up
[09:20] with the idea that it's likely to go
[09:23] lower because that daily chart we I
[09:25] called it in front of all of you I
[09:26] outlined it told you where it was going
[09:27] to go so that way we understand one
[09:30] I'm teaching something that I already
[09:31] proved before the fact so it's not like
[09:34] me coming back to this area here because
[09:36] if you haven't watched the videos proba
[09:37] let say you just found this YouTube
[09:39] channel and you're watching this one it
[09:40] sounds like the typical guy that comes
[09:42] on YouTube and says here's something
[09:43] that happened you know and I can sound
[09:45] and look and appear smart because it's
[09:48] already happened and I have no real risk
[09:51] in being
[09:53] wrong I told you it was going to go
[09:55] lower from here and it did now I'm going
[09:57] to take you inside that price section
[10:00] and outline what it is that I look for
[10:03] what it is that I looked for at the time
[10:06] and how I felt confident it was going to
[10:08] go lower
[10:09] okay so right away we know that price
[10:12] has traded up to the high end of that
[10:14] fair value Gap and again this level here
[10:16] is that daily chart let me go back up
[10:18] one
[10:19] chart that's this level here okay it's
[10:22] on this candle that low and the low of
[10:25] the fair value G is this candle's
[10:27] High dropping down in to the hourly
[10:29] chart that's the high end of the fair
[10:31] value Gap this is the low end of the
[10:32] fair value Gap again on an hourly chart
[10:34] so that way we have our
[10:36] bearings so when the market traded up
[10:38] into and just above that fair value Gap
[10:41] high this red level here once it started
[10:45] to break down and go lower it traded
[10:47] back down
[10:48] into this candlestick's
[10:52] high so we're trading back inside this
[10:55] range and we're range
[10:57] bound since I am expecting the daily
[11:00] chart to be the
[11:03] parent of this price structure all minor
[11:07] lower time frame swings are going to be
[11:10] subordinate to it and what does that
[11:13] mean this now is a long-term High I do
[11:17] not expect this High to be broken to the
[11:20] upside should it be broken to the upside
[11:22] that means that my daily analysis
[11:25] expecting this level here to hold price
[11:27] and to be a factor in the algorithm
[11:30] repricing and going lower at a later
[11:33] time if it goes above that then I'm
[11:36] probably wrong in my analysis so
[11:39] therefore I demand more information by
[11:41] studying more price action and sitting
[11:43] on my hands or if I have a trade on it
[11:46] means that I have to admit that I'm
[11:47] wrong and the stop out that may occur is
[11:50] just me managing risk it's a losing
[11:55] transaction does not mean your model is
[11:58] flawed it does not mean that you're a
[11:59] failed Trader it just means that that
[12:02] transaction was not a profitable one and
[12:05] it's just a cost of doing
[12:07] business but as long as price remains
[12:10] below this High my idea is this is a
[12:14] long-term High because it's framed on
[12:16] what a higher time frame resistance
[12:18] level if we're want to talk in terms of
[12:20] retail idea so that way we can
[12:22] understand something in a simplistic
[12:24] manner but we'll build on the ideas that
[12:26] will help move you away from simple
[12:27] support resistance ideas
[12:30] so this long-term high should remain
[12:32] intact and no's price should not go
[12:34] higher than that we trade down to the
[12:36] discount level of the low end of that
[12:38] fair value Gap and it starts to find
[12:41] support rallies back up trades near the
[12:44] high but does not take that out very
[12:47] important once it starts to break down
[12:49] and consolidate in
[12:53] here retail
[12:55] ideas will
[12:56] see a lot of trust in the idea that's
[12:59] potentially a bull
[13:00] flag I love seeing those patterns
[13:03] because I like to fade them so that's a
[13:06] false bull flag and when we see price
[13:10] break down like
[13:11] this and then rally back up every single
[13:16] time this is important this is the part
[13:18] where you start writing down these
[13:21] details every single
[13:24] time price rebalances an imbalance like
[13:28] we have this candle's low this candle's
[13:30] High we have that one single candle
[13:31] passing down like that once that
[13:34] rebalances by going up here that swing
[13:36] high from this high this high and this
[13:40] High that's a swing high right there I
[13:42] immediately label that in my mind not on
[13:45] my chart because I don't want anything
[13:46] distracting me if I have these things
[13:48] written on my chart at the
[13:51] time it's going to be a distraction to
[13:54] me but the way I'm internalizing it and
[13:56] you'll see what I mean as I go through
[13:57] this lecture
[13:59] every
[14:00] rebalance of an old imbalance That Swing
[14:04] that's created at that moment I
[14:06] immediately label that in my mind as an
[14:08] intermediate term high or in this case
[14:11] as we came back down and filled in this
[14:13] by dropping down here that's an
[14:15] intermediate term
[14:16] low what does that mean what's the
[14:18] significance of that typically what
[14:21] you'll
[14:22] see
[14:24] is intermediate term low has a higher
[14:28] short-term low
[14:29] to the right of it and a higher
[14:31] short-term low to the left of
[14:35] it this immed term low forms by
[14:38] rebalancing but it has a higher
[14:40] short-term High here but then the market
[14:43] trades over here off of this short-term
[14:46] low it rallies up but it
[14:50] fails it fails in
[14:52] here we're going to anticipate that
[14:56] failure whereas if you're looking at
[14:58] this low high higher
[15:03] low
[15:04] failed higher
[15:07] high higher
[15:09] low so what's forming here a
[15:13] pennant or a triangle pattern right how
[15:16] do you know which side's going to break
[15:18] out that was one of the questions I had
[15:20] all the time as a developing student
[15:21] back in the 90s 1992 1993 I was buying
[15:25] every book and get my hands on and I got
[15:28] the book
[15:30] the John
[15:32] Murphy technical analysis of the
[15:34] financial markets book which is the
[15:35] retail Traders Bible okay that book is
[15:39] so useful in terms of just reading it
[15:40] and knowing what not to do because
[15:43] that's what the 90% crowd follows when
[15:47] they look at Price action still to this
[15:48] day because it's always regurgitated in
[15:51] some way shape or form someone's
[15:53] teaching that same idea uptrending trend
[15:55] lines which are so subjective how do you
[15:58] know what swing lad attach for a trend
[16:00] line there's lots of Swing lows in here
[16:01] how do you draw it it's
[16:04] all subjective so you have to have a way
[16:07] to reduce it down
[16:09] to I hate to say it like this but it
[16:11] really is no better way of saying it but
[16:12] you have to break it down into a science
[16:15] we don't do technical analysis we do
[16:17] technical science okay you have to be
[16:20] able to relate to certain things way out
[16:23] and measure what these factors are
[16:26] within price action which is not based
[16:28] on hypothetical guesswork or some kind
[16:32] of a harmonic animal pattern which to me
[16:36] makes no sense you have to look at the
[16:38] relationship to price action and the
[16:41] relationship of how it
[16:44] behaves what is it indicating what is it
[16:47] showing the market has
[16:49] traded higher then
[16:52] Consolidated we failed to go above this
[16:54] important high back here that's a
[16:56] long-term High then we have an interterm
[16:58] High
[16:59] why why is this a intermediate term High
[17:01] because we have a short-term High here
[17:03] and a short-term High here so between
[17:06] two short-term highs the highest high
[17:09] between those that's an inter term
[17:11] high but the main takeaway for your
[17:14] notes so far is anytime a imbalance like
[17:18] this big candle up is rebalanced that
[17:21] becomes an intermediate term low just as
[17:24] well on the opposite end this down move
[17:26] here that's a fair value Gap soon as it
[17:29] rebalances there that's what I classify
[17:31] as an iment term high now here's where
[17:33] we take a huge step
[17:37] forward classically
[17:39] defined by Larry Williams and you can
[17:42] see where I made a departure from his
[17:43] works okay it was very influential in
[17:46] the beginning of my development and it
[17:48] was a point of argument internally with
[17:53] me when I was watching him teach it on
[17:56] his VHS course the future millionaires
[17:59] confidential trading
[18:02] course that idea of his approach to
[18:05] Market
[18:06] structure he teaches a little bit of it
[18:09] in this book okay so it's long-term
[18:11] secrets to short-term trading by Larry
[18:13] Williams um there's not a lot of books I
[18:15] have over 2,000 some books and I can
[18:18] tell you literally there's a handful of
[18:21] books out of all my collection that are
[18:25] useful and I can't bring myself to throw
[18:28] them away way because number one I paid
[18:29] a lot of money for him and it's just
[18:31] Nostalgia you know me chasing all that
[18:34] stuff in books and it's just always the
[18:36] same stuff that never really works the
[18:39] ideas that he teaches in this book here
[18:42] they were taught in a early work by him
[18:46] in regards to Market structure how to
[18:49] internalize price structure how to look
[18:52] at Price not just from a higher high
[18:54] higher low because that's too myopic
[18:56] okay it's a Pursuit
[18:59] especially in this generation today it's
[19:01] a pursuit of
[19:03] Simplicity for the sake of Simplicity
[19:05] alone not for the sake of getting to the
[19:08] truth or the heart of the matter and
[19:10] that's what makes me a stumbling block
[19:13] for many of you that are younger because
[19:16] you want right now instant gratification
[19:19] you want instant reward for the minial
[19:23] time that you
[19:25] invest when it's surprising to learn
[19:29] that you're going to take a lot more
[19:30] time than you first thought it was going
[19:31] to take to learn how to do this
[19:33] exceptionally
[19:35] well but for an additional view on how I
[19:40] built this understanding in price action
[19:43] it
[19:44] originally came from his idea of Market
[19:47] structure but if you study what I'm
[19:49] going to show you in this video lecture
[19:50] here my paid group has never seen this
[19:53] before and you're seeing it for the
[19:54] first time okay so when you hear people
[19:56] talk about Market structure
[19:59] and they're looking for a higher high
[20:01] higher high higher high and having
[20:03] successive lower lows behind them and
[20:06] then you have a
[20:08] failed higher high and then it breaks
[20:10] the swing low right before that failed
[20:13] higher high they look at that as a
[20:16] change in Trend uh not all the time many
[20:19] times that's a good buying opportunity
[20:21] for me because really that's just coming
[20:22] back down to a deep discount and I'm
[20:25] going to buy
[20:26] those and continue
[20:29] higher so it's a little tricky if you
[20:33] don't understand the higher time frame
[20:35] which is what these red levels are
[20:37] that's higher time frame the erarchy in
[20:41] parent
[20:42] to child price swings okay so that way
[20:46] the
[20:47] subordination that the smaller time
[20:49] frame price swings adhere to from the
[20:52] higher time frame is directly linked to
[20:54] the order flow on those higher time
[20:56] frame charts so in other words what am I
[20:58] saying
[20:59] the daily chart has the bulk of the
[21:03] volume that's coming into that
[21:06] Marketplace there isn't a lot of volume
[21:08] coming in on a one minute chart that's
[21:11] not to change the importance or reduce
[21:15] the importance rather of an of a one
[21:18] minute chart within the proper context
[21:20] and Market structure that's underway so
[21:23] you can use a one minute chart to
[21:25] navigate
[21:26] because as a smaller retail Trader which
[21:29] is who we all
[21:31] are but we don't trade with retail logic
[21:35] there's a there's a separation from what
[21:38] we're trying to do in price versus the
[21:42] collective out there that learns from
[21:43] books and things like that now that may
[21:45] sound like an Octor because I'm pointing
[21:47] to a book right here on the screen but
[21:49] the ideas that he teaches early in this
[21:51] book about Market structure I think is
[21:54] the
[21:56] whole well the only I found useful in
[21:59] that book I have a lot of respect for
[22:01] this man but out of that entire book his
[22:05] discussions about Market structure
[22:08] that's the only thing I find that is
[22:09] useful from that book so if you're
[22:11] reading anything else in that book you
[22:14] know great if you like it but my only
[22:18] addition to this for more research for
[22:21] more of a foundational idea where I got
[22:25] this from um you're going to hear people
[22:27] say um he teaches Larry Williams Market
[22:29] structure no I
[22:31] don't the ideas that came early on in my
[22:36] learning came from this man's
[22:38] interpretation of Market structure but I
[22:42] want to take you into the chart now and
[22:44] show you what he's not teaching in that
[22:46] book what he hasn't taught in any of his
[22:48] works and it gets a little bit closer to
[22:51] the heart of the matter and you'll find
[22:53] it it's it's really
[22:55] interesting so if we have a imbalance
[22:59] that's rebalanced and we have an
[23:00] intermediate term High shouldn't an
[23:03] intermediate term High have a lower
[23:07] short-term High to the right of it and a
[23:09] lower short-term High to the left of
[23:12] it yes Mr Williams says so in his book
[23:16] also would I discovered in my own study
[23:21] no one taught this to me okay I kind of
[23:23] pioneered this idea see a lot of these
[23:26] Instagram guys after saying they p
[23:28] neared something in the last two years
[23:29] of
[23:30] trading the idea of a intermediate term
[23:34] High not being
[23:37] higher than the short-term High to the
[23:39] left of it or the short-term High to the
[23:41] right of it in other words it's going
[23:45] lower this an ideal scenario should be
[23:48] this high should be above both
[23:51] short-term
[23:53] Highs but it's
[23:55] not it's
[23:57] not so what what is it doing it's only
[24:00] rebalancing
[24:02] this
[24:03] and where is it likely to go well if
[24:06] you're thinking in terms of a pennant or
[24:07] triangle pattern it's indicating to me
[24:11] soon as this candle starts to go up like
[24:15] this this candle and this candle why not
[24:19] this candle too well this candle only
[24:22] has this low here this candle is an up
[24:24] close but this starts the last two up
[24:26] closed candles right before this move
[24:29] down this is important because we're
[24:32] going to look inside this shaded area
[24:34] and how we can use highly precise ideas
[24:38] within this order
[24:40] block I'm anticipating this run up with
[24:43] these candles forming an order block
[24:46] where everyone else is
[24:48] teaching the idea of the last up Clos
[24:51] candle before the down move that is not
[24:54] my order block that is not my order
[24:56] block so you need to stop teaching that
[24:58] because it's not accurate call it
[25:00] something else but don't call it order
[25:03] block this movement here these two green
[25:07] candles that are going up I'm watching
[25:08] these as they form live with the
[25:11] expectation because this imbalance has
[25:13] been rebalanced here this swing high is
[25:15] an the intermediate term High I do not I
[25:18] do not expect this High to be taken out
[25:21] so I'm already forecasting and
[25:24] anticipating a failed price swing in
[25:26] here every time this green candles are
[25:30] forming I'm looking at that as a bearish
[25:33] order block so from the beginning at
[25:35] that candles low I'm looking in time on
[25:40] Lower time frame charts lower than what
[25:42] well this is a 1 hour chart so what's
[25:44] the time frame below
[25:49] that I dropped to a 50-minute time frame
[25:53] now before I get any further just know
[25:56] that the range between this long-term
[25:58] high and this long-term
[26:00] low that range is going to be used for
[26:03] targeting purposes and I'll get into
[26:05] that in a moment but these up closed
[26:09] candles from the hourly perspective
[26:11] that's the range for my hourly order
[26:15] block inside that range I can be
[26:19] hunting fair value
[26:22] gaps light
[26:26] bulb I don't need to see the market
[26:29] trade down below the last highest up
[26:32] closed
[26:34] candle I don't need that because I
[26:37] understand what I'm looking for inside
[26:39] Market structure actual Market structure
[26:42] not just higher high higher low I'm
[26:44] looking at the underpinnings of the
[26:46] marketplace and I'm examining what is it
[26:48] doing High to high low to low within a
[26:52] higher time frame
[26:54] premise remember the premise was we were
[26:57] going to go up to this upper level level
[26:58] here rebalance and then eventually trade
[27:00] lower down below sell side
[27:04] liquidity in this fractal I'm using this
[27:06] one here just to illustrate the idea so
[27:08] in other words up here it's going to
[27:11] make a short pattern something bearish
[27:14] to get short on then work towards going
[27:17] down to that
[27:19] low now clearly you can see it here does
[27:22] so nicely but I want to take you into
[27:24] this price action right here before I
[27:26] zoom in
[27:28] look closely what do you see pause the
[27:34] video I'm not ping at the do
[27:37] ICT and you can't make me all
[27:41] right right in here you can see a small
[27:45] little imbalance this one single candle
[27:47] like that right there that's the same
[27:50] thing that was occurring in this move
[27:53] here on the hourly chart that gets
[27:55] rebalanced
[27:56] there here we have a small version of it
[27:59] that is a fractal that's something that
[28:01] repeats on a smaller or higher time
[28:02] frame that's similar in its formation it
[28:06] won't be identical but it's closely
[28:09] related to the general
[28:12] idea if it trades back to this candle
[28:14] High don't worry I'll zoom in in a
[28:16] moment that's your entry right there
[28:19] that's aggressive and I don't have a
[28:21] problem being aggressive if I know what
[28:22] I'm looking for but there's also an
[28:25] imbalance in here and it rebalances that
[28:27] right there see that now once we
[28:31] establish the market structure on that
[28:33] hourly chart I'm not going down into the
[28:36] lower time frames below it and marking
[28:38] out all the swing highs and swing lows
[28:40] either that that's Overkill I just need
[28:42] to know what I'm looking for on the time
[28:44] frame I'm trading on the logic is based
[28:47] on that daily chart that it's going up
[28:48] into this imbalance to go
[28:50] lower the hourly chart frames my trade
[28:55] it gives me what I'm looking for to
[28:58] start hunting entry
[29:00] techniques now the 15-minute time frame
[29:02] that's the Bell weather this is where
[29:04] it's going to give me the actual get in
[29:07] get out but I might not like the risk
[29:09] parameters that's required on this time
[29:11] frame so I can go down into lower time
[29:14] frames should price go lower and break
[29:20] lower I'm looking at that short-term low
[29:23] here and that INR term low there if we
[29:26] have a short-term low taken out and an
[29:30] intermediate term low taken out or
[29:33] just an intermediate term low taken out
[29:37] then we can go back to the previous
[29:39] long-term High long-term low now a
[29:43] long-term High long-term low is
[29:45] generally going to be linked to a higher
[29:46] time frame daily chart that might be
[29:51] a price range it might be a high to a
[29:55] short-term low in this case I'm framing
[29:57] the idea and logic around that fair
[29:59] value Gap that I outlined in front of
[30:01] all of you saying it's likely go up
[30:03] there rebounce and then go lower and
[30:05] take out that old daily
[30:08] low there's lots of ways you can frame
[30:11] your
[30:12] trade but you have to have
[30:14] something directly linked to that daily
[30:17] chart because the daily chart that's
[30:19] exactly what institutions are working
[30:20] off of that's exactly what banks are
[30:22] working off of that's where the money is
[30:26] that's where your bias is going to be
[30:27] determined
[30:28] that's going to be what makes or breaks
[30:30] your Trend continuation that daily chart
[30:34] so the majority of your time in study
[30:36] should be on determining where that
[30:39] daily chart's going over the next day or
[30:41] two or a
[30:43] week but you try not to forecast longer
[30:46] than a
[30:47] week not that you can't I'm not
[30:49] suggesting that anyone can't do that I'm
[30:51] just saying if as a developing student
[30:53] you want to keep your perspective
[30:55] limited to a 5-day time Horizon and
[30:58] don't be upset if you don't have the
[30:59] entire weekly range forecasted correctly
[31:02] that's not important right now you're
[31:04] growing you're trying to learn how to do
[31:06] this and it's highly technical no one
[31:09] gets it overnight it took me six years
[31:12] so but it pays off if you stick with
[31:15] it so if we have a break below and any
[31:18] return
[31:19] low then we have what a significant
[31:23] break in Market structure this is
[31:26] something that's more significant just
[31:27] simply than going into a chart saying
[31:30] okay well it took out a short-term low
[31:31] there it is uh-uh see how much more
[31:33] detailed this
[31:35] is what this tells me is then I can
[31:38] start using this range high and low and
[31:43] start getting projections
[31:45] down I can get a measurement of
[31:48] measuring this High to this low and
[31:51] start replicating that going
[31:53] down and it'll give me price targets
[31:57] they're generic price targets if you
[32:00] don't want to use that targeting
[32:03] method this long-term low to interterm
[32:06] high if price breaks below here as it
[32:09] does here you can simply take your
[32:11] Fibonacci anchor it to the highest high
[32:13] down to the lowest low and this is what
[32:16] you would get
[32:17] here why am I using that why am I not
[32:20] using this here to here because this
[32:23] returned back up this is where all of
[32:26] this move starts right there this is
[32:29] just the beginning of the the framework
[32:32] this is where the swing begins on the
[32:35] decline follow what I'm saying I'll say
[32:37] it
[32:38] again this high and this low that's your
[32:42] framework the retracement that fails
[32:44] that starts the decline begins here at
[32:47] that intermate term high so if you
[32:49] anchor your FIB to the interm term High
[32:50] down to that low which is a long-term
[32:53] low the projection is -1 1/2 standard
[32:57] deviation and there's your low how much
[33:00] lower than this can it go that's one way
[33:03] of determining it now I know what you're
[33:05] asking what is your FIB settings ICT
[33:08] there's my FIB settings okay I don't
[33:10] toggle everything because I don't need
[33:13] all the lines but I'm looking at
[33:15] measurements like this with logic behind
[33:17] it it's not just me randomly going in
[33:20] there because I get a lot of qu when I
[33:21] was on baby Pips I got lots of emails
[33:23] all the time and people would post in
[33:24] the form why are you anchoring your FIB
[33:26] to That Swing high and not in that swing
[33:28] high and not this swing high this is
[33:30] what I never taught this is what I'm
[33:32] showing you today this is Advanced
[33:35] Market structure this is not something
[33:37] you're going to find in books Mr
[33:39] Williams I'm sure doesn't even know it
[33:40] like this he's rather simplistic in the
[33:43] way he does things that's the only thing
[33:45] I've really gleaned from him
[33:49] he's he's a legend don't get me wrong
[33:53] but he does things rather simplistic but
[33:56] but because of my background is computer
[33:57] programming and computer science and I
[34:00] have obsessive compulsive disorder I
[34:02] need to know why things do what they do
[34:05] and I need to know everything now I
[34:07] don't know everything but my pursuit of
[34:10] knowing everything led me to look at
[34:13] markets like this and internalize how
[34:15] what the algorithms are doing because
[34:17] there has to be a rhyme and reason right
[34:20] like to suggest the idea that these
[34:23] markets are operating under an algorithm
[34:25] and they're going up and down based on
[34:27] and AI artificial intelligence is
[34:29] controlling this it's not your buying
[34:31] and selling pressure I've said this many
[34:33] times before but if that is true and
[34:38] let's suspend your disbelief if you
[34:40] don't believe there's an algorithm just
[34:41] for the sake of this conversation let's
[34:43] just say for a moment that you do
[34:45] subscribe to the
[34:48] idea if there's an algorithm that means
[34:50] it must follow some form of
[34:53] logic and how does it
[34:56] reference how far to go up and how far
[34:59] to go down it cannot see your
[35:04] stop it doesn't see Michael stop it
[35:07] doesn't see Renee stop it doesn't see
[35:09] Juan stop it doesn't see
[35:12] Brian
[35:15] Larry that's outside of
[35:19] its
[35:20] capability but it
[35:22] knows where people will have their stops
[35:26] based on these ideas
[35:28] is short-term High short-term low
[35:30] interterm high interterm low long-term
[35:32] low long-term
[35:34] high and where the imbalances are now I
[35:38] already know right now at this moment
[35:40] right now your heads are spinning you're
[35:43] probably sitting here looking at man
[35:44] this is crazy how did he come up with
[35:48] this and how the hell am I going to use
[35:51] it exactly you're going to take time
[35:54] learning this line upon line precept
[35:57] upon precept here a little there a
[35:58] little it takes time to do this okay
[36:02] but I got requested to teach Market
[36:05] structure and this is my interpretation
[36:10] of Market structure because I'm leaning
[36:12] on algorithmic principles that are in
[36:15] the marketplace that can't be taught to
[36:18] you but I'm creating a language so that
[36:20] way you can see it visually in your
[36:22] chart and you can measure and reference
[36:25] certain things not exactly like the gthm
[36:28] does but very very close to what it's
[36:31] doing which in my mind doesn't really
[36:35] step on anybody's toes now does it so if
[36:38] we're looking at this little shaded area
[36:40] here I want to zoom in now and get down
[36:42] to the heart ofest
[36:43] teaching this is the same 15-minute time
[36:45] frame and just zoomed in a little bit
[36:46] more this is an aggressive entry for
[36:49] going short now that hourly chart was
[36:52] showing those two candles going up in
[36:55] the 15minute time frame it's obviously
[36:57] more cand
[36:58] so in this up close candle series of 1 2
[37:03] 3 4 five
[37:05] candles in that range if I
[37:09] get a fair value gy form with a
[37:12] breakdown like this notice I don't need
[37:14] a swing low
[37:16] broken notice
[37:19] that on the model I'm teaching you you
[37:22] have to look for
[37:24] what the short-term low being broken
[37:27] that's your Market structure shift then
[37:29] you see price go up into that imbalance
[37:31] and then you can go short or vice versa
[37:33] when you're going
[37:35] bullish if you understand Market
[37:37] structure with this perception looking
[37:40] at it from a higher time frame and
[37:42] anticipating a breakdown but then
[37:44] starting to classify each
[37:46] imbalance and swing high and swing
[37:49] low inate term highs and lows are formed
[37:52] at the rebalancing of an imbalance
[37:56] everything I already said in the video
[37:57] okay I'm just
[37:59] reiterating if the intermedi term high
[38:02] is not higher than two short-term highs
[38:05] that is telling you that the market is
[38:08] very weak and the algorithm is tipping
[38:11] its hand to those people that are
[38:13] looking at it like
[38:17] this who would be looking at like
[38:21] this smart Money traders someone that's
[38:25] not looking at a chart with harmonic
[38:27] ideas nothing Elliot wave they don't
[38:30] even look at support and resistance
[38:32] that's not a factor that's not a factor
[38:34] at
[38:34] all when Bank Traders sit down they're
[38:38] not looking at support and resistance
[38:39] they care less about a trend line they
[38:42] don't care about moving averages
[38:43] crossing
[38:44] over none of that
[38:46] stuff they're looking
[38:49] at imbalance rebalance and liquidity
[38:53] that is
[38:54] it that's it that's all they're doing
[38:59] now framing that within the context of
[39:02] Forex they would be utilizing the
[39:05] fundamental idea of interest rate
[39:08] differentials which I'll talk a little
[39:09] bit about not in this lesson but I said
[39:11] we go into Forex but right now we're
[39:14] teaching price through this
[39:17] medium and index Futures but this stuff
[39:20] works in Forex period okay there's no
[39:24] reason to question whether if it's just
[39:26] only going to work in this it works in
[39:29] all
[39:32] markets this is your aggressive entry
[39:34] you don't need a swing low being broken
[39:38] because you have the idea based on
[39:40] Market structure suggesting that this is
[39:42] exceedingly weak if it's exceedingly
[39:44] weak that means the next short-term High
[39:48] how do I know it's going to be a
[39:48] short-term High I don't know because I'm
[39:51] studying the up closed candles because
[39:53] that's going to be an order block later
[39:56] on
[39:57] now everybody else knows how to look at
[40:00] these candles after it goes below it and
[40:03] comes back up and bumps the bottom of
[40:05] that right there so the bottom of that
[40:07] rectangle that's the classic ICT bearish
[40:10] order
[40:12] block the advanced interpretation of an
[40:15] order block would be using Market
[40:17] structure like this which is
[40:20] unconventional but you start seeing the
[40:22] imbalances inside the order block when
[40:24] you're already expecting it to sell off
[40:27] see this interent term High I already
[40:30] know that this rebalance here classifies
[40:33] this in my mind as an interent term high
[40:36] that means it should not trade above
[40:38] that
[40:39] high just like this short-term high and
[40:41] this short-term High did not trade above
[40:43] this interent term
[40:46] High why is this an interent term High
[40:49] when it didn't even rebalance
[40:51] anything didn't think I'd get to that
[40:52] question did you he's reading my
[40:55] mind here's a long longterm High here's
[40:59] a swing High over here a swing High over
[41:01] here see that long-term high right
[41:05] intermed term High short-term High
[41:08] short-term high or if you want to use
[41:09] this one I'm using this one not
[41:11] classifying this one because this is
[41:12] energetic it moves lower you could have
[41:14] easily had a short-term High marker
[41:16] there but I'm using this one because it
[41:18] has that run lower to
[41:21] rebalance the IM term High has a lower
[41:23] short-term High to the left of it and a
[41:25] lower short-term High to the right of it
[41:27] so intermediate term highs there's two
[41:31] classifications it is a short-term High
[41:34] that has a lower short-term High to the
[41:36] left of it and a lower short-term High
[41:37] to the right of it or and this is the
[41:41] main one here it trades back up to
[41:45] rebalance and imbalance that immediately
[41:47] becomes an interm term
[41:49] high now the usefulness of that is if
[41:54] we're bearish and it rebalances like
[41:55] this the next shortterm high should be
[41:58] lower than that intermed term
[42:01] high if it trades higher than that then
[42:04] your trade ideas probably flawed Don't
[42:07] force that trade again wait for Market
[42:09] structure to get back in sync with what
[42:11] you're expecting something
[42:13] bearish that's how you keep from blowing
[42:16] your account or forcing your will in the
[42:19] marketplace now let's go back into the
[42:22] order block inside these candles as it's
[42:25] going up I'm looking at lower time frame
[42:26] TR and this is a 15-minute time frame we
[42:29] see it break down it doesn't take any
[42:30] short-term low out but it's inside these
[42:33] up Clos candles which is an hourly order
[42:35] block of two candles
[42:41] each the imbalance trades up into that's
[42:43] your aggressive sell your stock could be
[42:45] right above that
[42:49] High classic lowrisk High confirmation
[42:53] short entry is the classic return back
[42:55] to an order block after a trade down
[42:56] below it
[42:58] here's your little
[42:59] Gap here trade into it there's your
[43:03] short where's your stop Above This
[43:06] candle's
[43:09] High there you
[43:13] go
[43:15] now you can go down into the charts
[43:18] deeper with your 5 4 3 2 and
[43:21] one narrowing down to a smallest time
[43:25] frame you can see see that the last two
[43:28] candles here right for the turn inside
[43:31] the order block the order block is the
[43:34] Shaded pink box but these last two
[43:37] candles here with The
[43:40] Gap that low is exactly to the quarter
[43:45] point as that candle's high right there
[43:48] don't take my word for it go into your
[43:50] charts and you'll see that is exactly
[43:53] the perfect delivery to that candle's
[43:56] low
[43:57] what's so why am I pointing to that
[43:59] candle because the order block is one
[44:02] consecutive series of up closed candles
[44:04] it's not the last candle before the down
[44:09] move you can tell where these folks
[44:11] learned what lessons I taught from and
[44:14] where they pared from but order block
[44:18] theory is much more than just simply the
[44:21] last up close candle before down move or
[44:22] the last down closed candle before the
[44:24] up
[44:25] move that's not it
[44:29] this is it you have the up closed
[44:32] candles together here with the imbalance
[44:35] inside of a larger order block within
[44:37] the bearish market structure because we
[44:38] have an inant term High here then this
[44:40] run up is going to fail to go back Above
[44:43] This
[44:45] high now I know some of you are like
[44:47] this is too much they there's no how am
[44:49] I going to be able to go into the chart
[44:50] and be able to do this you're not going
[44:52] to right
[44:53] away but you need to go back to your
[44:55] data and your charts and start breaking
[44:58] them down and classifying them like this
[45:00] you have the benefit of
[45:02] hindsight that's how I began to trust it
[45:06] because I would go through old data and
[45:08] start breaking them down and looking for
[45:10] these things right here that's how I
[45:12] bridged what I learned about how the
[45:14] algorithm prices and books price and
[45:16] then I made a language within price
[45:19] charts that communicates very closely
[45:22] what it's
[45:25] doing this is the language that I
[45:28] created for all of you to understand
[45:29] what it is I'm trying to interpret to
[45:32] you that have never seen this
[45:37] before the imbalance
[45:40] here it goes over a little bit that's
[45:43] okay but inside this range in here more
[45:46] specifically the order block the hourly
[45:48] right here that's where your fill would
[45:49] be or aiming with your limit order and
[45:52] the heat on the trade would be on this
[45:55] candle's movement there but your stock
[45:57] would be above
[46:00] here but you're aiming for a very large
[46:04] downside objective so the risk from
[46:07] entering here at the bottom of the
[46:10] hourly bearish order block which is
[46:13] again represented by the bottom of that
[46:15] rectangle
[46:16] here you're entering there the Heat or
[46:19] the draw down in the trade is limited to
[46:22] just that candle but your stop has to be
[46:24] here and you're expanding lower for a
[46:28] Target that's many times over what your
[46:31] risk
[46:34] is dropping down to a 4-minute
[46:37] chart here's that same order block from
[46:41] the 5 minute perspective it's a little
[46:43] skewed now because we're looking at four
[46:44] minutes each candle's four minutes in
[46:47] duration Market trades up into that hits
[46:49] it perfectly not that it's link anything
[46:51] on the 4-minute chart but it's lengthed
[46:52] again to that 5minute
[46:54] chart hits it right there beautifully
[46:57] trades lower comes right back up trades
[47:03] into the top end that fair value gap on
[47:08] the higher time frame before we started
[47:10] dropping
[47:11] down we have a little bit of movement
[47:14] above it and that's okay because this
[47:16] Market is very volatile right now you
[47:19] can't demand the markets to always
[47:21] deliver with this level of precision
[47:24] sometimes you get this little coloring
[47:25] outside the lines and that's okay that's
[47:27] a matter of experience and time studying
[47:31] it and doing it you anticipate a certain
[47:34] measure
[47:35] of
[47:37] imperfection and still submitting
[47:39] yourself to the idea that just because
[47:41] it went above that level doesn't mean it
[47:42] broke it and it's going to keep going
[47:44] higher it's likely to do that and if it
[47:47] does don't freak
[47:49] out then the market trades lower and
[47:52] reaches where there's targets now what I
[47:55] want you to think about is when you see
[47:58] these patterns for entry now ton I
[48:00] taught you how to look at Market
[48:01] structure from an advanced
[48:03] perspective I already know some of you
[48:06] are going to be very confused by this
[48:08] lesson and I understand your confusion
[48:11] but that confusion is reduced by you
[48:15] going in and looking at Price data and
[48:17] start studying it and looking at
[48:19] it the idea is
[48:22] this when you see an imbalance get
[48:25] rebalanced the high
[48:28] formed as it
[48:31] rebalances that high should not be
[48:34] violated by Price going higher than that
[48:36] if you're
[48:38] bearish if you blend that with
[48:40] institutional order flow what is
[48:41] institutional order flow when you're
[48:45] bearish all of your up closed candles
[48:49] should keep
[48:50] price from going higher than them what
[48:53] does that
[48:54] mean we have an imbalance here the
[48:57] market trades up into the bullish
[49:00] candles that were on the five minute
[49:01] chart we're on a 4minute chart that's
[49:03] that red level here let me go back up to
[49:04] say you
[49:06] know that's this one here this is a down
[49:08] close candle right there these are the
[49:10] last two up close candles before the
[49:12] displacement here and then balance
[49:14] Market trades back up into that right
[49:15] there there's your bearish order Block
[49:17] it's aggressive but if you know what
[49:20] you're looking for that's very very fun
[49:21] to do that on the 4-minute chart there's
[49:25] that same return back to that 5-minute
[49:27] beish order block Watch What Happens
[49:31] Market breaks lower so we have up close
[49:34] candle and up closed candles the market
[49:37] trades higher yes but does it overtake
[49:40] this up Clos candle no it just trades
[49:42] back up into it a little bit but doesn't
[49:44] go above
[49:45] it wow that's important because if it
[49:49] doesn't overtake these up closed candles
[49:51] here or here it doesn't even need to get
[49:53] to these because it hasn't even overcome
[49:55] this one so it acts as real
[49:59] resistance that's institutional
[50:02] orderflow your Market when it breaks
[50:06] again from the consolidation in here all
[50:09] of these up closed candles never get
[50:10] reached into again here at all but
[50:13] notice what we got over here we have up
[50:15] closed candles the market leaves it then
[50:19] it comes right back up does it overtake
[50:21] these up Clos candles no so it's going
[50:23] to remain
[50:25] heavy so in
[50:28] short I've taught you tonight to look at
[50:31] the markets from a market structure
[50:35] perspective by breaking down the price
[50:38] swings labeling them specifically in
[50:42] inbalance that's
[50:43] rebalanced that intermediate term high
[50:46] or
[50:47] low should not be violated that's a key
[50:51] high or a key
[50:53] low that sets the stage for a market
[50:56] move at that should unfold and deliver
[50:58] to a higher time frame objective in this
[51:01] case as we outlined in the beginning I
[51:03] showed you last week in the week before
[51:05] that that we were looking for weakness
[51:07] in NASDAQ to take out its daily
[51:11] low if you combine that logic with
[51:14] Market structure and the imbalance
[51:16] rebalance becomes intermediate term
[51:18] highs and lows those key highs and lows
[51:21] with them not being violated if they are
[51:23] violated that means your idea is wrong
[51:26] and you cancel the idea and you don't
[51:27] try to go in and force it again and
[51:29] overtrade and blow your
[51:32] account while the market is moving in
[51:35] your favor you're going to continue to
[51:37] trust that move and hold on to your
[51:39] trade because if you're bearish up Clos
[51:42] candles should keep price below it or
[51:46] them if it's multiple up closed
[51:49] candles they're speed bumps they may
[51:52] come back up and touch them and act as a
[51:55] what bearish order block but you do not
[51:57] want to see them traded above if you're
[52:01] bearish and vice versa if you're bullish
[52:04] when price is moving higher generally
[52:07] the candles will be
[52:08] predominantly Green in my case because
[52:10] I'm looking at Green candles when it's
[52:12] going higher whatever your candle color
[52:14] is on your
[52:16] platform predominantly there's going to
[52:18] be more up closed candles when it's
[52:19] bullish but down closed candles should
[52:24] support price if it trades back down to
[52:26] them them it's going to act as a support
[52:28] structure for an order
[52:29] block so I've given you two mean
[52:34] components to Market structure and
[52:36] institutional order flow how to know
[52:38] when the move is still good and not be
[52:40] afraid and how do you know when the move
[52:43] is likely to be dynamic and how do you
[52:46] know when the idea is probably flawed
[52:49] and your interpretation or your analysis
[52:51] is wrong if that intermediate term high
[52:53] or low is broken
[52:56] after your trade idea becomes
[53:00] possible if that in term high is broken
[53:02] and you're bearish then you got to move
[53:04] through the sidelines and don't go in
[53:06] again wait for more setups in the future
[53:09] it may be in the same trading session or
[53:11] it may be in the same trading day or it
[53:13] may require you to trade in the
[53:14] following week you just can't force it I
[53:18] taught you institutional order flow
[53:21] which is
[53:22] again I've already mentioned this in the
[53:24] previous lessons where we we're bullish
[53:26] and we're expecting a price swing higher
[53:29] generally there is not a lot of down
[53:30] Clos candles in that price swing higher
[53:33] but those down closed candles should
[53:35] support price should it trade back down
[53:37] into them and not see them
[53:40] overlapped in other words going down
[53:42] below it if it does it's only
[53:45] permissible if there's a short-term low
[53:49] in close proximity to it and it's then
[53:51] lik like just go down and take out some
[53:52] sell stops if it's bullish and then
[53:54] reaccumulate and go higher if there is
[53:57] no swing
[53:58] low there would be no swing low with
[54:01] cell side below it so there's nothing to
[54:03] concern yourself with just look for down
[54:05] Clos candles to support price
[54:08] higher so in other words price swings
[54:10] that are bullish down closed candles are
[54:13] your support in price swings that are
[54:15] bearish up Clos candles are your
[54:20] resistance
[54:22] now if you blend these ideas together
[54:26] you get a perspective on price that
[54:29] cannot be gleaned from other teachers
[54:32] Educators Traders authors gurus or
[54:37] whatever but these are my responses to
[54:41] folks that ask me how do I know what
[54:44] swing high and what swing low to use as
[54:48] you can see it's not a question that I
[54:51] can go in and say in one simple
[54:53] statement this is what I'm doing it
[54:56] takes
[54:56] takes deeper thought it takes study and
[55:01] it has to require supportive lessons
[55:04] that there's still going to be needed
[55:05] for the majority of you that are sitting
[55:06] here listening to me and you're saying
[55:08] okay I can see what you're saying I can
[55:10] see it but there's no way I would have
[55:12] came to that conclusion on my own nobody
[55:14] would expect you to you're too new you
[55:17] haven't been doing it enough and frankly
[55:20] I've never taught this before this is
[55:22] what I've kept close to my V but
[55:27] I want to give and I want to share but
[55:31] you're not going to understand this in
[55:33] one lesson but because I am trading and
[55:36] I'm sharing and I'm teaching I will show
[55:39] you more examples that way you can see
[55:42] the logic behind it but I want you to go
[55:44] back to your charts and look at every
[55:46] time the market rebalances classify that
[55:48] as an interterm high or interent term
[55:51] low if it's you know with a rebound
[55:54] that's been moving higher than went down
[55:56] balance
[55:57] that and then watch how
[56:00] prices stay away from violating it and
[56:04] if you can frame a context around a
[56:06] price swing that's linked to a higher
[56:08] time frame chart like the
[56:10] daily then you have a wonderful model
[56:16] that has higher time frame order flow
[56:19] behind it that is Paramount for your
[56:22] trade to work if you can't see it
[56:24] working or following suit to what the
[56:29] daily chart's likely to do or in
[56:31] layman's terms if you're trading against
[56:33] what that daily time frame or daily
[56:35] chart is likely to be doing you are
[56:38] absolutely asking for
[56:40] failure you're asking for it you're
[56:42] begging for it that's not to say that
[56:45] you can't go long when the daily chart's
[56:47] going
[56:48] lower but why would you want
[56:51] to why would you want to swim against
[56:53] the
[56:54] tide why would you want to be the
[56:58] salmon the salmon that fights its way up
[57:02] against the current just to get to the
[57:04] top of the
[57:05] river spawns and then dies you got there
[57:09] but failed in the
[57:10] end you want to be working with the tide
[57:15] you want to be moving with the EB and
[57:18] flow of these markets on a high time
[57:20] frame because that daily chart if you
[57:22] understand that daily chart let's go
[57:24] back up to it
[57:31] if you're doing all of your
[57:32] analysis and linking your trade ideas
[57:37] based on the logic behind this time
[57:39] frame
[57:40] here you're going to avoid a lot of
[57:43] losing trades now you're going to lose
[57:45] you're going to have losing trades I
[57:46] have losing
[57:48] trades but you're going to avoid the
[57:50] silly mistakes that the majority of
[57:52] retail Traders
[57:54] make you're not going to to
[57:56] see why on a 15-minute time frame or a
[58:00] 5-minute chart why it's not turning
[58:03] around and reversing intraday when it
[58:05] feels like it might be doing so because
[58:07] you'll have these small little you know
[58:09] quick Dynamic little Pops in the
[58:12] direction it's counter with the daily
[58:13] chart
[58:14] suggesting those are just little traps
[58:17] they're little moves that get people
[58:19] caught up in oh it's going to go reverse
[58:20] let me get and Chase that and then it
[58:22] just creates another selling opportunity
[58:25] when the daily chart is like to continue
[58:26] going lower so you have to submit
[58:29] yourself to what this daily chart is
[58:31] doing what's it reaching for and when it
[58:34] reaches
[58:35] it
[58:39] stop get a lay of the land again check
[58:41] your barings which is what I'm going to
[58:44] close this video with
[58:45] now we were up
[58:48] here we rebalanced I said all of this
[58:51] here is just normal for us to anticipate
[58:54] a run down below here this is is this
[58:56] rebalancing for another leg lower to go
[58:58] down
[58:59] here so we have had that in price it's
[59:03] delivered but now we're back above that
[59:05] low so what does that mean for us well
[59:09] on the daily chart it's been bearish but
[59:12] we're back
[59:13] Above This Old low that is in my
[59:17] mind do nothing we're neutral right now
[59:21] why why would you be neutral can you
[59:24] still be bearish yes
[59:26] can you be bullish if you want to go
[59:29] against the trend of the daily time
[59:33] frame well it just brings with it a
[59:36] greater measure of risk now there's
[59:38] going to be
[59:39] times where you can go back in the
[59:40] charts and say but yeah look at this
[59:42] time anybody can do that I'm looking at
[59:46] the hard right Edge right now and my
[59:48] paid mentorship group is hearing this
[59:49] video Just Like You
[59:51] Are I Am neutral right now I am not
[59:55] taking any
[59:56] trades there's a lot of things going on
[59:59] globally there's a lot of confusion
[60:02] right now money is Running Scared in the
[60:05] marketplace and I don't see where we're
[60:08] going next with a great deal of
[60:11] certainty so what did I just say to you
[60:15] publicly I don't
[60:19] know what are you say ICT just said he
[60:22] don't know something he doesn't know
[60:24] what the Market's going to do right
[60:26] right now I don't know so if I don't
[60:29] know and if I can't classify it based on
[60:31] the things I'm looking for in
[60:32] price yes it could possibly go a little
[60:35] bit higher this could be the low it
[60:37] could be some kind of reversal they
[60:38] could you stop doing what you're doing
[60:40] over there in Europe and in Ukraine and
[60:42] everything becomes happy and nothing
[60:44] happens bad again for a couple months
[60:47] and the markets go
[60:50] higher I don't see that right
[60:54] now I don't know if it's is going to
[60:56] continue going
[60:58] lower where it's at right
[61:00] now
[61:02] neutral because I can't justify it
[61:05] one-sidedness okay this is how I teach
[61:07] my my pay group the things I teach
[61:11] them if you can't go into your charts
[61:14] and line up an idea that's bullish and
[61:17] have no way to frame it on a bearish
[61:20] stance in other
[61:22] words if you can very easily communicate
[61:25] it in your analysis that it's likely to
[61:27] go higher but it's a real hard stretch
[61:30] to sell it for a bearish idea that's
[61:34] high
[61:35] probability if you can frame it bearish
[61:38] but have a hard time defining it in a
[61:41] bullish perspective that's high
[61:44] probability now how many trades have you
[61:46] taken in your time as a Trader
[61:50] where it could go either way but what
[61:53] the hell I got time I'm in front of the
[61:55] charts let me just get here see what
[61:56] happens and you enter a market and then
[61:58] you
[61:59] lose what happens after that you have a
[62:02] lot of regret and you know what you're
[62:04] thinking I don't even know why I did
[62:06] that that was dumb why' I get into the
[62:08] marketplace everyone's done that
[62:11] everyone has done that and I have blown
[62:14] accounts doing that 1990s I was Reckless
[62:19] did whatever I wanted to do and none of
[62:21] it was really hinged on Sound Logic it
[62:24] was me discovering risk because I didn't
[62:27] respect it when I first went into it but
[62:29] I found out real
[62:31] hard that it hurts and you don't want to
[62:33] go through that
[62:37] so this brings this lesson to conclusion
[62:41] tonight and I am absolutely certain that
[62:44] you have a Litany of questions and
[62:48] concerns and
[62:50] confusions all of those things get
[62:52] answered over time spending time with me
[62:56] looking at examples and you'll see it
[62:59] over time it cannot be understood in one
[63:02] lesson it absolutely cannot happen and I
[63:05] know some of you young guys are going to
[63:06] want to post in the comment section I
[63:08] understand exactly what you said I've
[63:10] seen this 15 times before don't I I
[63:13] don't look at those messages and think
[63:15] to myself wow and I'm not going to let
[63:18] that message be posted to the video
[63:21] comment section I'm not looking
[63:23] for you know messages that fluff me up
[63:27] I'm just looking for ones that I like
[63:30] okay
[63:31] and if it's something that I think that
[63:33] would be been official to the community
[63:35] I'll use it but if it's something I just
[63:36] thought it
[63:37] was funny or useful that's the one I
[63:41] like out of all the comments it doesn't
[63:42] mean that all the comments that were not
[63:44] selected were useless or uh less
[63:49] important because some of them are
[63:51] questions I am using your questions in
[63:54] the way I'm teaching so that way I'm
[63:56] covering a lot of the bases that you
[63:58] guys are saying I'm stuck with
[64:00] understanding this but just know that
[64:02] there's a lot of the questions that
[64:03] you're asking that will be answered in
[64:04] the normal progression through the
[64:06] lessons I have planned for you it may
[64:08] not feel like it it may feel like you're
[64:10] being ignored or that I don't care about
[64:12] your question or I'm somehow avoiding it
[64:14] because I don't have an answer I have
[64:16] answers okay I have answers to the
[64:18] questions you have not had aise in your
[64:21] thoughts yet but you just got to relax
[64:23] and go through the natural progression
[64:24] of it this is very technical stuff folks
[64:27] very very
[64:29] technical you don't need to be this
[64:31] technical but I was asked to teach
[64:34] Market structure and there's a lot of
[64:36] folks out there especially on YouTube
[64:38] that pretend to know about Market
[64:39] structure but they have no real idea
[64:42] what they're doing the only thing
[64:43] they're explaining is what's already
[64:45] happened in the price charts I'm showing
[64:47] you something in Greater detail what I
[64:49] outline to every one of you in this
[64:51] YouTube channel everyone in this YouTube
[64:54] channel watched me outline this market
[64:56] right here and it
[64:58] moved
[65:00] 14,500
[65:02] points based on that logic that's a lot
[65:06] that's a very significant price move and
[65:08] it behaved exactly how I'm teaching it
[65:11] to you that should
[65:14] be reassuring number one but also it
[65:17] should be intriguing
[65:20] because if I'm able to sit down with you
[65:23] and this was not a CH how many times
[65:24] have I put out suggest sus either in the
[65:27] comment section of my community tab or
[65:30] in video how many times have I said
[65:32] something and it didn't come to
[65:36] pass they're not cherry-picked I'm
[65:38] showing you things that are based on the
[65:40] logic that I'm teaching you okay so it
[65:43] removes the necessity for Blind Faith
[65:46] okay don't believe me because I'm ICT
[65:48] believe what I'm teaching you and that
[65:51] you're seeing in the charts yourself
[65:53] when you're back testing and watching it
[65:55] it
[65:56] live that's where the proof is
[65:59] discovered cuz I can do this every
[66:01] single day and there still going to be
[66:03] people that's going to doubt and the
[66:05] folks that are convinced already they
[66:06] don't need any more Assurance they just
[66:09] want to learn and that's what I'm doing
[66:10] I'm teaching you I'm teaching you
[66:12] exactly what's going on on that hard
[66:15] right edge of that chart and right now
[66:17] at this moment I'm teaching you a
[66:21] greater lesson when not to do something
[66:26] you may have an account
[66:27] open you may have time to be in front of
[66:30] your charts you may have an
[66:33] idea some kind of inkling that you think
[66:38] the Market's going to do this or that
[66:40] I'm telling you personally I am not
[66:43] touching this at all I'm not trading
[66:46] Forex I'm not trading Futures I'm not
[66:49] trading crypto I've never traded crypto
[66:52] and I'm not touching stocks I'm not
[66:54] touching bonds I'm not trading anything
[66:57] right now I'm going to let the rest of
[67:01] February transpire without me
[67:05] engaging it's done exactly what I
[67:07] outlined for all of you it was a nice
[67:09] price move it was logical it was precise
[67:12] it delivered exactly as I outlined
[67:15] beforehand and tonight I taught you the
[67:18] internals behind that in a very
[67:21] structured detailed
[67:24] way your infancy as a student under me
[67:28] is going to be an impediment to you
[67:30] understanding everything and even my
[67:32] paid mentorship group are probably
[67:34] scratching their heads tonight too
[67:36] because there's gaps in their
[67:38] understanding because I just literally
[67:40] introduced this for the first time they
[67:43] have they don't have this in any of the
[67:44] lessons they had none of them no one has
[67:47] seen me teach this it's the first time
[67:50] I'm
[67:51] unveiling what it is when I look at
[67:53] Market structure what is it I'm doing
[67:57] how am I framing things I'm using a top
[68:00] down approach from the daily down to the
[68:02] lower time
[68:03] frames but the time frame I'm framing
[68:06] the setup on which was the hourly chart
[68:10] using higher time frame logic and the
[68:13] order flow in other words I'm bearish
[68:15] because that daily chart suggest that
[68:17] it's going to go down below here when it
[68:20] was up here this went down too quick and
[68:24] why do the market even creating a fair
[68:25] value got why does the market go up here
[68:28] because this Market dropped one-sided
[68:32] right
[68:33] here it just went down there wasn't a
[68:36] lot of give and take back and forth It's
[68:38] one candle that went down like
[68:40] that because it's one candle it's one
[68:43] day one
[68:45] interval it's going to have the
[68:48] likelihood not it must always not that
[68:51] it's going to do it immediately but the
[68:54] expectation is it's likely to go back
[68:55] back up into this area here with an up
[69:00] candle balancing out the movement lower
[69:04] it's going to go back up to offer buyers
[69:06] an opportunity to buy at those prices it
[69:08] matters not if those buyers are correct
[69:11] in their assumptions about this
[69:13] Marketplace the algorithm is allowing
[69:19] efficiency for Price
[69:21] delivery and in layman's terms it means
[69:24] it went down to too quick it wasn't
[69:26] offering enough time for anyone that
[69:29] wants to buy it so it goes back up once
[69:32] it does that it
[69:34] rebalances right there spends a little
[69:36] bit of time and then displacement again
[69:38] and then right to where we outlining
[69:42] it the question I want to leave you with
[69:45] is
[69:47] this why does it respect the levels I'm
[69:50] teaching here in the logic from
[69:53] imbalance to liquidity
[69:56] if everything is based on trend lines
[69:59] moving averages harmonic patterns
[70:02] Fibonacci this Elliot wave
[70:06] that if those things were real and they
[70:09] had factors that really made price go
[70:13] higher or
[70:14] lower answer this for me this is the
[70:16] riddle you need to figure out
[70:19] okay how does the market
[70:22] know which discipline it's going to f
[70:25] follow any given day is it going to
[70:28] follow harmonic animal patterns or is it
[70:31] going to follow Elliot wave or is it
[70:33] going to use supply and
[70:35] demand or is it going to use volume
[70:38] profile is going to use white
[70:40] cof is it going to use the patterns
[70:44] that's found on range
[70:46] bars is it going to use what's in
[70:53] ichimoku you getting the point
[70:57] it all of those disciplines do not
[71:00] agree all of them they're at odds with
[71:04] one
[71:05] another one discipline's going to say
[71:07] wait for this one discipline's going to
[71:09] say wait for that so how is it that the
[71:14] market determines which discipline it's
[71:17] going to use for that given time period
[71:19] or that
[71:21] day that's
[71:23] nonsense that's you being
[71:28] religious any of you that subscribed to
[71:30] those ideas and I
[71:32] did you are under a faith-based
[71:36] premise that what you're
[71:39] learning should
[71:41] work when it's not based on any of those
[71:46] things the Market's only
[71:48] book and print these
[71:51] candles based on two principles
[71:57] liquidity going above old highs for buy
[72:01] stops going below old lows for sell
[72:03] stops
[72:05] or rebalancing or creating imbalance so
[72:08] it's imbalance rebalance run for
[72:11] liquidity that's it it does not do
[72:14] anything else the algorithm is not
[72:16] looking at harmonic patterns it's not
[72:18] thinking well you know I haven't used a
[72:20] bat pattern in a while so let's drive
[72:22] them
[72:22] batty it's not thinking I want to scare
[72:26] the living hell out of them and create a
[72:28] shark
[72:31] pattern it's silly it is silly and I
[72:34] know some of you trade like this okay
[72:36] and I'm not trying to make fun of you
[72:38] I'm just asking you to be highly
[72:40] critical about a perception of what it
[72:44] is that we as Traders do and how much a
[72:47] fallacy it
[72:49] is when you strip all that stuff
[72:52] away and it sounds like I'm biased
[72:54] because this is what I'm teaching you
[72:56] but noce what I'm doing I gave up
[72:58] millions of dollars a
[73:00] year to come out here and teach for
[73:03] free I could still be making millions
[73:06] there's many of you are still asking can
[73:07] I just join on your page no you can't
[73:09] join be happy I'm teaching I'm teaching
[73:11] mentorship right here come
[73:15] on what's in it for
[73:18] me I'm already rich I already know how
[73:21] to
[73:23] trade a lot of people like what I do
[73:26] I don't need to be doing this I just
[73:29] enjoy it but why is the market doing
[73:32] what I teach so precisely so
[73:39] consistently maybe it's because this is
[73:42] the
[73:43] market maybe it's
[73:46] because this is the
[73:49] algorithm I'll leave that with you to
[73:52] decide enjoy your weekend be safe and
[73:56] I'll talk to base with you on Tuesday
