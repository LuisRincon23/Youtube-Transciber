[00:11] all right folks welcome back this is the
[00:13] 2022 ICT mentorship on
[00:17] YouTube and this lesson is going to be
[00:19] intraday order flow and understanding
[00:21] the daily
[00:24] range all right folks we're looking at
[00:27] tradingview.com and you can can use this
[00:30] platform for free uh there are some
[00:33] benefits to having a membership there
[00:35] it's not terribly expensive but
[00:37] nonetheless it provides you a means of
[00:41] looking at charts that I show in my
[00:43] mentorship here and in my private
[00:45] mentorship group so it's the same charts
[00:48] that I'm producing for that community
[00:51] that I'm producing for you as well
[00:53] everything in this lecture is going to
[00:54] be predominantly around teaching you the
[00:58] elements of the e-
[01:01] mini setting up your daily range and
[01:04] your intraday layouts and I'll talk a
[01:06] little bit about daily profiles so that
[01:09] way I'll help you and I'll compare in
[01:11] contrast showing you what it is that
[01:13] you're trying to learn from me here
[01:16] versus what is available out there in
[01:18] the internet okay so that way you can
[01:20] decide whether or not this is going to
[01:21] be a worthwhile Pursuit for
[01:23] you these things that I'm
[01:26] teaching today are direct ly linked to
[01:31] index features okay like S&P NASDAQ and
[01:35] theal okay you can use the Russell
[01:38] 200000 those are the markets that I'm
[01:40] targeting with the lessons the ideas
[01:44] of trading the Asian range and things
[01:47] like that they are not applicable to
[01:49] these markets I don't teach that to my
[01:51] students I want you to just focus on the
[01:53] things I'm going to show you in this
[01:55] mentorship all right first things first
[01:57] I'm going to get the boring stuff right
[01:58] out of the way
[02:00] whenever you're looking at Futures
[02:02] especially the index Futures these
[02:04] contracts trade with expiration dates
[02:08] and the months that they trade are going
[02:10] to be shown here es is the symbol for E
[02:15] mini S&P H in this example stands for
[02:18] March so the delivery month codes for
[02:21] the commodity markets H is always
[02:24] representing the month of
[02:27] March m is June U is September Z is
[02:32] December these are the only four months
[02:34] that the index Futures trade
[02:38] on E mini S&P e mini NASDAQ and E mini
[02:42] Dow
[02:44] okay the year obviously is what it is
[02:46] now if you're going to be using like for
[02:48] instance when I take live trades in the
[02:51] TDM trade they don't take their year
[02:54] symbol like this it's 22 but in trading
[02:57] view if you're pulling out the symbol
[02:59] like I have here
[03:01] e2022 that represent the Emin S&P 500
[03:04] contract for delivery month March year
[03:08] 2022 okay since they expire it's
[03:12] important for you to know that the third
[03:15] Friday of the
[03:17] month of delivery which is obviously in
[03:19] this example here March the third Friday
[03:22] of that month is expiration you do not
[03:25] want to be trading after expiration and
[03:28] the question is going to be is when when
[03:29] do I start trading the next month out
[03:33] okay this is always going to be the
[03:34] front month or the current month or
[03:36] nearby contract the month after the
[03:39] front month or current contract month is
[03:41] always going to be referred to by me as
[03:43] the next month
[03:44] out if you ever have a doubt you can go
[03:47] to barchart.com and you can go to the
[03:51] select commodity tab here this is all
[03:54] free you can scrub down into this list
[03:57] here go to S&P 500 E mini click on that
[04:01] it'll open up what I just showed you
[04:03] there and the the first one that's the
[04:06] cash you don't want to look at that the
[04:07] next contract available is March see
[04:11] that even gives you the little
[04:13] cheat right now this is considered the
[04:15] front month or nearby
[04:18] contract the open interest is what I'm
[04:21] watching okay so one week before
[04:24] expiration which is the third Friday of
[04:28] the delivery contract month month so
[04:30] third Friday of March third Friday of
[04:33] June third Friday of September third
[04:34] Friday of December roll over to a new
[04:37] year starts the sequence all over again
[04:39] March June September December real easy
[04:40] pattern real
[04:42] easy means of keeping track of where
[04:44] you're supposed to be at but usually
[04:47] around the first or second day of the
[04:50] week prior to expiration I start
[04:52] monitoring open interest and I want to
[04:54] be in the month that has the larger open
[04:56] interest number notice that the June
[04:58] contract only has
[05:10] 57,124 million so this is the larger
[05:13] liquidity base contract month so I'm
[05:16] going to be trading this
[05:17] month if it becomes a matter of this
[05:21] month here has larger open interest than
[05:25] this one here then I'm going to be
[05:28] trading the next month out because I
[05:30] want the liquidity that's available in
[05:31] the larger pool liquidity offered by the
[05:35] most traded contract month okay so
[05:37] hopefully that answered that question
[05:38] got a lot of questions regarding
[05:41] that all right so now what we're looking
[05:44] for is an opportunity and I'm going
[05:47] to teach bias and specific entry
[05:52] techniques next week this week I'm
[05:55] teaching you the intraday framework and
[05:57] I want you to start thinking about
[05:58] market profiles and you're going to have
[06:00] homework assignments obviously for that
[06:02] at the end of this video but we're going
[06:05] to
[06:07] assume that you were bullish in here
[06:10] okay I'm going to provide proof in this
[06:13] video that I was bullish and I did
[06:15] execute with that bias in mind but but
[06:18] just kind of put that to the sideline I
[06:20] know some of you are very anxious and
[06:21] you're leaving comments saying can you
[06:23] teach me how to get in you know what you
[06:26] know what am I looking for I understand
[06:28] your excitement but take the lessons at
[06:31] the pace that I'm giving you because I'm
[06:33] giving you homework assignments and
[06:35] studying so that way it helps build and
[06:38] ingrain the understanding I'm giving you
[06:40] because your study time is actually
[06:42] going to be where the majority of your
[06:43] learning is going to come from I'm just
[06:45] giving you you know points of reference
[06:47] so that way you can go in and start
[06:48] looking at things and start seeing a
[06:51] reoccurring repeating
[06:53] phenomenon but I want to take
[06:57] a look at the
[07:00] 15minute time
[07:03] frame all right
[07:06] and when you're looking at this
[07:09] 15-minute time frame this is the Bell
[07:10] weather time frame this is
[07:12] where I'm looking for key highs and lows
[07:16] I'm looking for imbalances like fair
[07:18] value gaps and things of that nature um
[07:21] yes I'll look for order blocks but I'm
[07:22] going to try to stay away from order
[07:23] blocks in this lesson in this mentorship
[07:25] really because I have models that don't
[07:28] even rely on order blocks obviously I'm
[07:30] teaching fair value Gap here and that is
[07:33] the main focus because it repeats it's
[07:36] easy pattern it's it's there a lot but I
[07:40] want you to think about how you frame
[07:42] your day so when you're in trading view
[07:44] or you can do this in your own platform
[07:45] if you're not using trading view but I'm
[07:48] recommending you at least while you're
[07:49] going through mentorship here on YouTube
[07:52] to go through the process with trading
[07:54] view all right and then this is what you
[07:57] would classically see annotated in my
[07:59] chart for a Forex setup I'm taking you
[08:03] to
[08:05] 8:30 okay you're going to put a vertical
[08:07] line there at
[08:08] 8:30 click this clone I know this is
[08:12] very boring for some of you because you
[08:14] really want to just get in there and get
[08:15] to the nuts and bolts but I have new
[08:18] people watching the same video so I have
[08:21] to make this as complete as possible and
[08:23] try to cover all the bases and then
[08:26] hopefully I don't get as many
[08:28] emails cuz I can't keep up with them and
[08:30] so if you email me and I'm not
[08:32] responding I apologize but I just I I
[08:35] can't keep up with
[08:37] it all right so we looking
[08:42] at there you go that's good all right so
[08:46] the equal distance and time in the
[08:48] morning then an hour lunch New York
[08:50] lunch and then an equal amount of time
[08:52] after that okay so I want to zoom in
[08:58] here and in your mind I want you to
[09:00] think about that lunch hour and this is
[09:03] always New York local time okay set your
[09:07] trading view chart to this if you do
[09:10] that no matter where you are in the
[09:11] world you'll be able to calibrate your
[09:13] local time with this okay everything I'm
[09:16] showing you is directly linked to New
[09:20] York local time if you do it with any
[09:21] other time frame you're going to mess up
[09:24] you won't have the same calibrations as
[09:26] all my students in what I'm looking at
[09:28] in price because eventually I'm going to
[09:29] be showing you charts on my community
[09:31] tab that I want you to be watching
[09:33] before it happens but before I even
[09:35] start doing that I'm not going to create
[09:37] a train wreck by having everybody
[09:39] looking at charts in their own local
[09:41] time and not New York time and
[09:43] completely miss the the point and plot
[09:46] so once we have
[09:49] this I want you to think of this hour
[09:58] here noon to 1:00 in the
[10:01] afternoon New York
[10:04] time that is a no trade time period I
[10:08] don't care who tells you that they can
[10:10] do this and do that if you're learning
[10:12] from me just don't trade during that
[10:14] time okay not even in demo because just
[10:16] trust me don't do it
[10:18] okay as we go through the mentorship
[10:21] you'll understand more reasons why I
[10:23] just can't give everything in one video
[10:24] obviously I want to and I I want to do
[10:27] 4H hour long teachings but but I'm
[10:29] trying to make them palatable because I
[10:31] know majority of you don't have the
[10:33] attention span because you're new and
[10:36] you're just now discovering so I'm
[10:38] trying to bear that in mind when I'm
[10:39] making these presentations so you have
[10:41] your daily range on an intraday
[10:45] basis all set up and laid out so these
[10:48] are your boundaries your morning trade
[10:50] is between 8:30 in the morning why
[10:53] because there's news events that come
[10:54] out at
[10:55] 8:30 all the way to noon preferably
[10:58] around 11:00 I generally don't like to
[11:00] take
[11:01] trades after 11 o'clock in the morning
[11:04] now it doesn't mean I haven't or that I
[11:06] won't I just generally try not to I want
[11:09] to try to be positioned before 11:00 and
[11:11] hopefully be riding something into the
[11:14] New York lunch at noon and then you know
[11:17] squaring positions or taking some off if
[11:19] I'm going to hold through the lunch and
[11:20] anticipate something going through to
[11:23] the close and we'll talk about that when
[11:24] we get into
[11:25] profiles not volume profile okay uh the
[11:30] idea of the afternoon session I wasn't
[11:34] going to teach that
[11:35] but because I see a lot of nonsense on
[11:39] YouTube I'm going to I'm just going to
[11:41] teach it to you okay so it's going to be
[11:43] a complete daily treaties on the entire
[11:47] daily range of indices so that
[11:51] way if you're interest is in this asset
[11:55] class you'll have a far better chance of
[11:57] being successful in my opinion using the
[12:00] information I'm going to give you okay
[12:01] and I'm proving it with actual
[12:03] executions as you'll see later in the
[12:05] video all right so we're looking
[12:08] at prior to 8:30 what are you looking
[12:10] for okay I got a lot of questions in the
[12:12] comment section I'm reading all the
[12:14] comments folks I love it because it's
[12:16] real short little Snippets I know a lot
[12:18] of my students they like to send me
[12:19] these really long-winded appreciative
[12:21] emails and then they give me one chart
[12:23] that doesn't really explain much to me
[12:25] and I can't really answer it so the
[12:28] comment section that
[12:30] I'm opening up on every one of these
[12:31] videos if you haven't noticed I'm
[12:33] allowing one comment that to kind of
[12:35] like honor those individuals that are
[12:37] showing appreciation and they're not
[12:38] gratuitously you know looking to praise
[12:40] me I don't like that okay I I I like the
[12:44] appreciation for my time and energy and
[12:47] sacrifice giving it to you for free but
[12:49] I don't want to be worshiped okay I
[12:51] don't want all that kind of stuff don't
[12:53] call me the goat don't call me you the
[12:54] greatest of all time I don't like that
[12:56] kind of stuff but if you have something
[12:58] that you want me to touch on and improve
[13:02] a delivery or explanation of a specific
[13:06] thing I mentioned in a video I may
[13:08] already have something in a future
[13:10] lesson planned but if it's something
[13:13] that I don't have in my outline that's
[13:16] going to be in future videos I'll
[13:18] utilize the feedback I get okay so that
[13:21] way I understand some of you want
[13:23] everything all at one time and there's
[13:25] no way I can do the all that in one time
[13:27] but I am taking the feedback back I'm
[13:29] getting from you all and I'm using that
[13:32] okay but one of the questions I got was
[13:35] what highs and lows are we looking for
[13:38] that you know a stop run would be framed
[13:41] on or what would be the Catalyst for a
[13:45] stop hunt well prior to 8:30 if you look
[13:48] at that okay
[13:50] we'll just grab a horizontal
[13:53] Ray and we see this High here and I'm
[13:57] utilizing this with the benefit of
[13:58] hindsight
[13:59] cuz this is how you're going to go back
[14:00] and back test everything I want you to
[14:02] take a look at
[14:05] the high
[14:13] here and the low right
[14:18] here so prior to 830 and other words to
[14:21] the left of that on a 15-minute time
[14:23] frame what's the most significant or
[14:27] obvious swing high and swing low swing
[14:29] high as this it's a candle with a lower
[14:31] high to the left of it and a lower high
[14:33] to the right of it three candle pattern
[14:35] okay it does not matter if the candles
[14:37] are up or down closes you're just
[14:40] looking for a swing High because above
[14:42] that's it's going to be buy side
[14:43] liquidity or buy stops and a swing low
[14:46] prior to 8:30 that's a candle that has a
[14:49] higher low to the left and a higher low
[14:51] to the right of it it's three candles
[14:53] again it does not matter what
[14:55] the close of the candles are it has
[14:58] absolutely no bearing on what I'm
[15:00] showing you here because the swing
[15:02] points are where liquidity is going to
[15:03] be placed okay so once you have these
[15:06] levels on your chart on a 50-minute time
[15:08] frame then you can drop down into your
[15:12] first lower time frame for
[15:15] entry that's your F minute chart so
[15:18] let's do that now all these things will
[15:20] be transposed right to the 5minute Chart
[15:22] you won't lose anything in case you're
[15:24] wondering I know a lot of new people are
[15:26] afraid if they do something with the
[15:28] time frame they'll lose
[15:29] annotations all right so now we have
[15:31] this old high back here look
[15:34] at look at this price right there okay
[15:36] that's going to be the uh high price on
[15:39] that particular candle right there it's
[15:42] 45145 this candle trades to 4514 A5
[15:47] exactly the same high when we have that
[15:50] but look closer we have relative equal
[15:54] high but we have it in multiple
[15:55] short-term highs that keep going higher
[15:57] if there's three
[15:59] highs they go up like that that's a
[16:01] classic three drives pattern uh there's
[16:03] a book I really enjoyed when I was in
[16:05] the 90s uh Linda rash and Larry Connor's
[16:08] uh Street smarts book um really nice
[16:10] little book I don't like everything in
[16:12] the book but I liked a few of the things
[16:14] that they talked about
[16:17] and it helped me understand stop hunts
[16:21] because I couldn't understand it as a
[16:23] developing
[16:25] student that
[16:29] why would the price want to go for those
[16:31] stops it didn't make any sense because
[16:33] the books that I had bought never really
[16:35] explained all that in in detail they
[16:37] just said trust this pattern of
[16:39] continuation or reversal pattern and the
[16:42] idea of stop hunts or raids on liquidity
[16:45] never really came up so it was an alien
[16:50] topic to me so when I started delving
[16:52] into the charts and started looking at
[16:54] it it helped me and the pattern that she
[16:58] and Larry mentioned in there was the
[17:00] three little endings pattern it sounds
[17:02] quirky sounds a little silly but it's
[17:04] basically the three drives pattern okay
[17:06] that means it's a swing High a higher
[17:09] swing High and a higher swing high so
[17:11] it's three times the market kept
[17:12] pressing up I like to see this pattern
[17:14] forming when there's an old high back
[17:17] here okay on any time frame it's
[17:19] Universal okay but if you ever start
[17:22] seeing these three drives up into an old
[17:25] high you don't have to see that third
[17:27] High take out the old High because what
[17:29] it's doing is
[17:31] it's already pressing into running out
[17:34] liquidity every time it creates a swing
[17:35] high and it starts to go down bears are
[17:37] trying to sell that and they're putting
[17:40] buy stops rating above the previous high
[17:42] and they keep getting taken so it's
[17:45] already building in liquidity and
[17:48] informed investors or quote unquote
[17:49] smart money will be already establishing
[17:52] short
[17:53] positions then the market breaks in one
[17:57] of the previous videos I talked about
[17:58] the pattern or the setup and I suggested
[18:03] not
[18:04] using a particular swing low that looks
[18:06] like it's been violated and why didn't
[18:09] that trade work out wouldn't that be a
[18:11] losing
[18:12] trade I want you to think
[18:15] about this idea that I teach which is
[18:18] displacement
[18:20] okay if you have a children's swimming
[18:24] pool okay if you have a children's
[18:26] swimming pool in your backyard and you
[18:28] fill it up and then you have an elephant
[18:31] just fall down inside of it what's going
[18:34] to happen the water's going to be
[18:35] displaced okay it's going to be an
[18:37] obvious displacement of that
[18:39] water rather simplistic analogy but
[18:42] that's what you're looking for in price
[18:44] when price goes above an old
[18:46] high and it trades down below it you
[18:49] want to see an obvious displacement you
[18:51] don't want to see it just dude like H
[18:52] well you know little lethargic run here
[18:55] that's not enough this is like that
[18:59] elephant falling into that children's
[19:00] swimming pool it's no doubt about it it
[19:03] really had a displacement when that
[19:05] occurs then you go in you start looking
[19:07] for the fair value
[19:09] G the low the high and if it trades back
[19:13] up into that then you can look for a
[19:15] short
[19:18] okay there's a process that you go
[19:21] through learning it and it's good that
[19:24] three of you were very critical about it
[19:26] but but trust me there's rules for
[19:28] reason and I'm not trying to hide
[19:31] failure because these patterns sometimes
[19:33] will fail you okay you'll read them
[19:35] wrong or they just won't work okay
[19:37] sometimes the market will have some kind
[19:39] of a news event that comes out or it
[19:41] just simply just rolls over top of it
[19:43] and goes higher goes lower that's a
[19:45] losing trade that's why you have to have
[19:47] a stop loss that's why you have to have
[19:49] good sound money management because if
[19:50] you don't have those
[19:52] things Murphy's Law is going to creep in
[19:55] and whatever can go wrong will and if
[19:56] you leave it open to the markets that
[19:58] determination how bad the Pain's going
[20:00] to be trust me you don't want that okay
[20:03] you want to limit that so now we have
[20:06] this previous High previous low now if
[20:09] we did not this is really important that
[20:11] you understand this part here if we
[20:12] don't start seeing these higher highs
[20:14] forming and it's just one steady run up
[20:16] then you anticipate a high like this to
[20:18] be taken out and it doesn't need to be
[20:20] taken out by much just trade above it
[20:23] and then you want to look for this
[20:24] energetic movement lower that's
[20:25] displacement where it's really animated
[20:28] so in other words it would look like
[20:30] when you're looking at your
[20:33] chart that's a little bit more
[20:35] pronounced because it went Above This
[20:37] previous High here you're looking at
[20:40] this one but as it's starting to move
[20:41] towards that old
[20:43] high remember 830 prior to that you're
[20:46] looking for what's this it down a swing
[20:48] High yes so it's trading above it here
[20:51] does it have an energetic break below
[20:53] that no it's just a very weak anemic
[20:57] move lower then you have another run
[20:59] higher here and then you have this Wick
[21:02] or tail come down and it quickly snaps
[21:04] back does that create a fair value Gap
[21:06] in that no it's not there yet then it
[21:09] goes higher here doesn't go above it
[21:12] matches that high but then now this High
[21:15] watch does it go below that yes a little
[21:18] bit here but it's a little anemic still
[21:20] but then look what we have here it
[21:21] trades up and then smashes down then the
[21:25] next candle here closes what do we have
[21:27] there's your fair value got
[21:31] that's your short and you could reach
[21:33] for the liquidity resting below that low
[21:35] that you would be identifying prior to
[21:38] 8:30 so sell side liquidity matching up
[21:42] with your short you sell you want to buy
[21:45] it back to cover that short well here's
[21:47] waiting sellers right down here in the
[21:49] form of sell
[21:51] stops bam hits it
[21:54] okay putting aside that you may not have
[21:59] seen this as a long entry okay maybe you
[22:02] didn't see this as a potential
[22:03] continuation of
[22:05] bullishness but look at these highs
[22:08] here what's resting above that now buy
[22:12] stops buy side liquidity and then what
[22:14] do we have here right before lunch hour
[22:17] it goes slightly above it and then
[22:19] trades down and then we're in that time
[22:21] of the day you don't Trade It New York
[22:23] lunch hour noon to one don't trade it
[22:27] okay do not trade it it can do a lot of
[22:29] weird things in that hour or simply do
[22:31] nothing and go sideways but either way
[22:33] you don't want to be a participant in
[22:35] that because it's
[22:37] just it's not usually a clean time of
[22:39] day for Price action so now here we have
[22:42] the high of the day and all the
[22:44] liquidity resting above here that would
[22:47] not have been tagged by this in other
[22:48] words stops are resting a little bit
[22:50] above that because there's a lot of
[22:52] people trying to sell short they want
[22:54] they want to see this thing go lower but
[22:56] we created a very important low last
[22:57] week and the market has already tanked a
[23:00] lot so it's pulling back up in the run
[23:04] that it created going lower on a daily
[23:06] chart so all these buy side liquidity
[23:09] pools here are going to be a reason for
[23:13] the market to want to reach up to that
[23:16] because you don't have to be a
[23:17] participant down here as a buyer you
[23:20] just need to know on the other side of
[23:21] lunch at 1:00 start watching and see is
[23:25] there an indication that this thing
[23:26] wants to go higher
[23:34] and as you can
[23:38] see all the buy side liquidity here was
[23:42] ran aggressively here but then the
[23:46] market trades right into the close
[23:49] aggressively
[23:51] bullish small little retracement here
[23:53] small little retracement here and then
[23:55] immediate run right into the close
[23:58] now obviously the market trades a little
[24:00] bit beyond that but this time of day
[24:03] expect whatever algorithms that you
[24:05] would expect to be driving price and
[24:08] price runs to pretty much cap the the
[24:11] majority of the volume that's going to
[24:12] be in that
[24:15] day
[24:17] so what I want you to think about is how
[24:20] the day is designed to have a morning
[24:23] move a lunch hour where you don't want
[24:26] to be trading and then the afternoon
[24:30] move go back through your charts and you
[24:32] can go back as far as you want the more
[24:33] you do this the better you'll get but I
[24:36] want you to think about creating your
[24:38] charts like this and then describing
[24:42] what the morning Trend was was it a
[24:46] bullish move was it a bearish move was
[24:48] it
[24:49] consolidation if it was consolidation
[24:52] prior to that part of the day in other
[24:54] words the previous day or the previous
[24:55] days was it bullish or bearish then
[24:59] because if it was bullish this is
[25:00] probably setting up another continuation
[25:03] higher especially if you start seeing
[25:05] these relative equal highs forming where
[25:07] it Paints the idea that this is retail
[25:10] resistance so Traders are going to think
[25:12] that this is going to go lower and it
[25:14] starts to build up a lot more interest
[25:16] in the form of buy side liquidity or
[25:18] buying interest at a high price even
[25:21] though those Traders may be framing the
[25:22] context of their trades as a short entry
[25:25] trying to make money going lower they're
[25:27] protective stop if they choose to use
[25:30] one it's going to be in the form of a
[25:32] buy stop and this is where it's going to
[25:34] be at so the Market's going to want to
[25:36] gravitate towards that especially if you
[25:38] start seeing the swing lows not the one
[25:41] in lunch time ignore that one you start
[25:43] seeing the swing lows that are forming
[25:45] every candle has a higher low to the
[25:47] left and higher low to the right if they
[25:49] start building up and every time they
[25:51] create a new one it's going
[25:54] higher that's a under pinning of the
[25:57] marketplace that showing accumulation it
[26:00] wants to go up because it wants to clean
[26:03] out all this here plus we've been going
[26:06] up for a few days on the daily
[26:09] chart plus the sentiment is everybody
[26:12] thinks it's been going down so they all
[26:14] want to sell short because they want to
[26:15] see a stock market crash but what they
[26:17] are failing to realize is we've already
[26:19] went down below a old low on the daily
[26:21] chart so now we're running back the
[26:24] other direction and anyone that's trying
[26:26] to sell short unless it's a real quick
[26:29] intraday scalp they're having their
[26:31] clocks
[26:32] cleaned so in the Aon there's a trend
[26:36] and one of the built-in characteristics
[26:39] of the afternoon is there's mechanisms
[26:42] that are built in that help this Market
[26:46] really accelerate into the close and if
[26:49] you studied the price action in your
[26:51] lower time frame charts you'll see that
[26:53] there's a repeating phenomenon at
[26:55] typically around 20 minutes to 4 and 10
[26:59] minutes to 4 and
[27:01] 4:00 and it's all based
[27:04] on Market on close orders that's really
[27:07] what it is okay and the algorithms will
[27:09] start spitting out really really
[27:12] aggressive pricing and forcing traders
[27:15] to either cover or you know get out of
[27:19] their trades and usually if it's going
[27:21] up it really just ramps up and
[27:22] accelerates in that direction so while I
[27:27] really enjoy trading the morning session
[27:29] because there's a lot of volatility and
[27:31] excitement if you're looking for if you
[27:34] know what your daily bias is and we'll
[27:36] talk about that next week if you know
[27:38] what your daily bias is and if you know
[27:40] what you're looking for in terms of
[27:42] range expansion on the daily chart now
[27:44] what what I mean by that the daily
[27:46] candle do you expect it to trade higher
[27:48] or lower you're not trying to predict
[27:51] you know every single daily candle's
[27:54] close but you're trying to determine do
[27:56] you think that the daily candle you're
[27:57] looking at forming today or what would
[28:00] be forming tomorrow is it more likely to
[28:02] be expanding higher or lower if it's
[28:05] expanding higher in your analysis that
[28:07] means you want to try to trade with the
[28:09] expectation to find a trade in the
[28:12] afternoon based on the logic that was
[28:14] used in the morning so in other words
[28:16] think about what I taught in Forex the
[28:19] daily range okay creating a initial high
[28:22] of the day and the low of the day here
[28:25] now this is not the time of London but
[28:28] this would be like what I teach as a
[28:30] London
[28:31] low in a buy day for Forex this would be
[28:34] the low of the day then we consolidate
[28:37] and then we get the New York
[28:38] continuation and it runs in the same
[28:41] direction that the London session formed
[28:43] but this is not London this is all New
[28:46] York time so there's a little bit of
[28:48] adjusting that needs to be taken into
[28:51] consideration which is why I made sure
[28:53] at the beginning of the video I said
[28:55] make sure your charts are set to New
[28:57] York time over here it needs to be that
[29:01] okay and if you don't have it like that
[29:02] everything you're learning here if it's
[29:04] at your
[29:05] local time in your local time zone it's
[29:09] it's going to be a mess so you need to
[29:11] calibrate your charts on trading view to
[29:13] that and everything I'm showing you here
[29:15] is it's the same thing every day every
[29:17] single day same thing so back to the
[29:19] homework
[29:20] assignment I want you to think
[29:22] about outlining what the session was in
[29:26] the morning and then what did session do
[29:28] in the afternoon sometimes what you'll
[29:30] see is it'll be bullish in the morning
[29:33] and then reverse in the afternoon or
[29:35] it'll be bullish in the morning and
[29:37] continuation higher in the afternoon and
[29:40] you'll get like a measured move what's a
[29:42] measured move whatever the morning move
[29:43] was it'll duplicate that twice so if it
[29:47] moves up 200 points in the morning the
[29:50] afternoon could see another 200 points
[29:52] in addition to that and have a 400 Point
[29:54] range or we could have a consolidation
[29:57] in the morning session
[29:58] and then it Trends in the afternoon
[30:00] higher or lower okay and I want you to
[30:03] go through your charts and look at that
[30:05] on an intay basis do your charts like
[30:07] this and I know it's a lot of work but
[30:09] you want to learn how to do it right
[30:11] this is how you do
[30:12] it then study what the daily chart was
[30:16] showing days before when it had days
[30:20] that had these nice runs like this and
[30:22] yesterday and previous
[30:24] Friday so it allows you to help find
[30:28] these big moves where if you're looking
[30:31] at other like I'm not going to say this
[30:34] to try to be mean-spirited CU that's not
[30:36] my intent here but I want you to compare
[30:38] and contrast like if you look around at
[30:41] all the folks on
[30:44] YouTube and again this is this is not me
[30:46] trying to be arrogant I just want you to
[30:48] understand there's a stark contrast to
[30:50] what I'm teaching you here and what is
[30:53] predominantly shown in this area of
[30:58] trading okay index fatures you'll see
[31:01] Traders that'll get in
[31:05] here and they get in a price like
[31:08] that and then they're going to make a
[31:10] big
[31:13] attempt to worry
[31:16] about a
[31:23] move like
[31:25] that and they'll put lots of contracts
[31:27] on on and you know trade this and have a
[31:30] whole lot of hype and anxiety about
[31:32] whether or not it's going to move in
[31:33] their favor and worry about their stop
[31:35] getting hit and all this stuff
[31:38] and I don't want you thinking like that
[31:41] okay I don't want you thinking like that
[31:42] at all I want you to think about how if
[31:44] this day was bullish for you say you had
[31:47] the benefit of knowing that through
[31:48] analysis you felt that this was going to
[31:50] go higher okay if that's the case this
[31:54] swing low here first swing low any
[31:58] importance after 130 this is really
[32:01] important
[32:03] 130 I'm looking for swing highs and
[32:05] swing lows for the afternoon session
[32:07] that's what I'm looking
[32:08] for it's the same context that I use for
[32:11] the morning session I'm looking for
[32:13] swing highs and swing lows prior to
[32:15] 8:30 I'm looking for the first one okay
[32:18] I'm not needing to go back days and days
[32:20] and days I'm just looking for the first
[32:22] one it's not a complicated
[32:24] thing but at 130 that's usually when I'm
[32:28] wanting to start trading the afternoon
[32:30] that's the earliest but I'm preferably
[32:33] looking for a swing high and swing low
[32:35] to form at 130 why 130 because there's
[32:38] an algorithm macro that starts running
[32:40] at
[32:41] 130 that's beyond the scope of this
[32:43] mentorship but just trust me there is
[32:46] something going on that creates movement
[32:49] at 130 in the New York session okay in
[32:53] equity market so when that occurs all
[32:56] we're looking for or what I'm looking
[32:58] for is a swing High and a swing low and
[33:00] then that same basis of looking for a
[33:03] stop hunt in the morning like we
[33:05] described here I'm looking for the same
[33:06] thing here that's it same thing so now
[33:09] think about this I'm I'm thinking that
[33:12] these stops are in Jeopardy because it's
[33:14] too clean the level's too clean straight
[33:17] line edges in the market they don't tend
[33:20] to stay like that there's going to be a
[33:22] disruption the Market's been going
[33:24] higher hasn't it
[33:26] yes there this pent
[33:31] up aggression that this Market wants to
[33:35] go higher but it's seeing short-term
[33:37] resistance here here it tried it a
[33:39] little bit here and then retraced inside
[33:41] the lunch hour the algorithm
[33:44] reserved the price run until later in
[33:47] the day now watch what happens this
[33:50] swing low here gets violated right
[33:54] there see
[33:56] that That Swing Low gets violated right
[33:58] there that small little stop Hunt is all
[34:01] that's necessary that will start what is
[34:04] called a buy program a by program is
[34:07] when the algorithms go into the process
[34:10] of spooling spooling is where it just
[34:12] continuously keeps offering higher
[34:14] prices if it's a buy program it just
[34:16] keeps offering higher prices it does not
[34:17] matter what the volume is it does not
[34:20] matter and I don't care who you know who
[34:22] worked at at the exchange I don't care
[34:25] trust me when I tell you if you go
[34:27] through the charts you're going to see
[34:29] this okay look at the volume that comes
[34:33] in sometimes it'll be good volume and
[34:35] another like why is this happening right
[34:39] that's that's your signature that's how
[34:40] you know that this is being completely
[34:44] manipulated so if it's being manipulated
[34:46] doesn't it stand profitable for you to
[34:49] know what it's likely to do not if
[34:51] you're going know it all the time you're
[34:53] not going to know I don't know it all
[34:54] the time but these things tend to repeat
[34:57] and if they repeat a majority of time
[35:00] not every
[35:01] day but the majority of time if these
[35:04] things are in alignment if they start
[35:06] showing the same
[35:07] fingerprints it's probably going to pan
[35:10] out and then you can start
[35:12] doing long
[35:14] entries and then hold for the close
[35:18] don't get in here and try to trade these
[35:19] little Mickey Mouse moves and worry
[35:22] about them and over leverage and try to
[35:24] put more contracts on than your account
[35:28] can really weather because if you don't
[35:29] know what you're
[35:30] doing cheap leverage discount leverage
[35:34] can murder you can absolutely murder you
[35:37] and especially in these kind of markets
[35:39] they're very fast markets right now I'm
[35:40] loving it but it's very quick violent
[35:44] volatility and if you don't know what
[35:46] you're
[35:47] doing you can literally be dismantled
[35:51] very quickly expediently okay
[35:54] so inside this area
[35:58] the market creates a swing low runs
[36:00] through this low stop hunt so the stops
[36:03] below here what sell
[36:05] stops buy those sell stops I know it
[36:09] feels scary but go through your charts
[36:11] and you'll see many examples of this
[36:12] happening it's the same thing took place
[36:14] over
[36:15] here buy the sell stops that are resting
[36:18] below here and expect this level to be
[36:21] taken
[36:24] out consolidation through lunch at after
[36:27] 1:30 in the afternoon wait for a swing
[36:29] low to be
[36:30] violated and then rally what if you
[36:32] don't get a swing low that trades below
[36:34] it what do you look for well you look
[36:36] for a move higher that's
[36:39] sudden displacement
[36:42] higher then look for a fair value Gap if
[36:45] it trades back down in the fair value
[36:46] Gap you buy that there's your two
[36:48] patterns that's it that's the only two
[36:50] patterns you need you don't need 15
[36:52] different gimmicky names okay you don't
[36:54] need Breakers you don't need an order
[36:56] block
[36:57] see how easy that is very simple
[36:59] strategy very very simple strategy you
[37:02] have a trade one way or the other and
[37:05] the logic has to be there for either one
[37:07] of them to
[37:08] form now I was not in the EM Min S&P
[37:14] today I was trading NASDAQ so let's go
[37:16] over to NASDAQ and I'm going to save
[37:18] time and not put all the lipstick on the
[37:20] chart I hope you can allow me that
[37:25] but here is 130
[37:28] we have a swing low there and it's
[37:30] basically almost the same low as that
[37:32] one so what's happening
[37:34] here what's that it's trading down below
[37:37] it see
[37:39] that look further to the
[37:42] left what's
[37:45] that fair value
[37:47] Gap man it can't be that easy it can't
[37:50] be that easy these relative equal highs
[37:52] what's above that buy side
[37:53] liquidity
[37:55] okay watch I'm going to drop into a one
[38:00] minute
[38:03] chart scrub back
[38:07] here
[38:11] to
[38:14] 130 and I don't need to do 20 contracts
[38:19] or 10
[38:20] contracts to do like a
[38:22] $20,000
[38:24] day that's kind of like the flavor of
[38:26] the month right now
[38:28] and if you
[38:32] look at this low and this low here what
[38:35] are those they're relative equal lows so
[38:38] that's going to be viewed as what
[38:39] support retail support and they're going
[38:41] to buy those little runs here they're
[38:44] basically going to chase that so if you
[38:47] look at
[38:48] this through the scope
[38:51] of below this
[38:54] level there's sell stops and you think
[38:57] it's going to go
[38:58] higher like I believed it was going to
[39:00] go higher
[39:01] today I want to be buying those stops
[39:05] all right so say you're watching price
[39:07] it's Meandering through through through
[39:10] and then all of a sudden That Swing Low
[39:13] forms right there and we had this low
[39:16] here and we had this sudden drop down
[39:18] when you see that if you're watching it
[39:21] on a like a one minute chart that's
[39:23] going to look so Dynamic
[39:25] so aggressive if you're zoomed in it's
[39:28] going to feel like the floor has just
[39:31] dropped out but that's exactly what
[39:34] you're looking for to
[39:36] buy now you
[39:39] see fellas out there on YouTube You're
[39:42] Going To See by contrast there are folks
[39:45] out there that are trying to
[39:48] trade you know just a handful of ticks
[39:51] with a lot of contracts that to me
[39:53] doesn't make any sense but if that works
[39:57] for you did great okay but I want you to
[39:59] think about in comparison and by
[40:01] contrast what seems more logical for you
[40:05] to feel it's worth more to pursue in
[40:09] study and learning how to do something
[40:11] like that where it's risk a lot put a
[40:15] lot behind the trade and try to get just
[40:17] a little bit of a move or now this is a
[40:21] demo account okay but I did trade live
[40:23] today too but just for the purposes of
[40:25] teaching the content
[40:29] right
[40:30] there that low is the lowest
[40:34] candle it rallies all the way up okay
[40:39] and then right
[40:41] here that was a
[40:43] close there's a better way to do this if
[40:46] you know what you're looking for you can
[40:48] be very very precise about it you can be
[40:51] dialed
[40:52] in
[40:54] like nobody's business like it is
[40:58] unbelievable in terms of the predictable
[41:01] nature of these markets especially these
[41:03] markets because they're they're traded
[41:04] by a lot of Institutions and a lot of
[41:06] professional Traders the manipulation
[41:09] that takes place in these markets is
[41:11] still there but it's not
[41:14] as well vulgar or ruthless as it is
[41:20] sometimes in Forex the inbank markets
[41:22] man they can really really you know do
[41:25] you dirty quick and more fre
[41:27] frequently the Futures Market they tend
[41:31] to be a little bit more cleaner a little
[41:33] bit more predictable much more nicer in
[41:36] their delivery now there are times when
[41:38] reports come out or something you know
[41:41] unannounced comes into the world scene
[41:44] and causes
[41:45] volatility when that occurs then you'll
[41:48] get that noisy look to price action just
[41:52] stand on the sidelines wait for things
[41:53] to smooth out it may not be that same
[41:55] trading day it may require you a day or
[41:57] or maybe even a week let the markets go
[41:59] back into sync and then they'll start
[42:02] delivering very nice again but the the
[42:05] main thing I want you to take away is
[42:08] that you know showing entries like this
[42:11] and ex and
[42:12] stuff it's
[42:15] not it's not all that much of a big deal
[42:21] okay but it becomes a sticking point
[42:25] okay a stumbling block
[42:27] for people that want to try to learn how
[42:29] to do this because if you lay it in
[42:31] front of them they have to have lots of
[42:34] contracts to do something to be
[42:38] profitable in such a small little move
[42:40] to me it
[42:42] communicates that that person that's
[42:44] trying to trade like that whether it's
[42:46] the person that created the system or
[42:47] someone that's trying to learn the
[42:48] system they really have no idea how
[42:52] price works and how it books because if
[42:54] they did they wouldn't be trying to take
[42:55] these little tiny little micro out of
[42:57] the marketplace they would be trading
[42:59] like I'm showing you here
[43:03] so if you were to think to yourself hey
[43:07] I want to know what it's like to be in a
[43:10] move where I can be
[43:12] comfortable knowing that the daily range
[43:14] is going to unfold and I'm just going to
[43:16] submit to
[43:17] it well these markets offer that Forex
[43:21] offers it too but right now in the last
[43:24] couple months really Forex has been
[43:26] rather funky okay and because of that we
[43:30] have transitioned to index
[43:32] Futures there are times of the year
[43:35] where I teach index Futures Trading
[43:37] because they're predominantly more
[43:40] liquid and or if there's no real topic
[43:43] for me to teach to my paid mentorship
[43:44] group I'll say I got nothing for you for
[43:47] Forex and then I'll point to Something
[43:49] in Futures it may be a commodity market
[43:51] like last year I told everybody buy the
[43:53] gray Market say were're going to have a
[43:54] huge bull market boom they went up it's
[43:57] a matter of knowing how to navigate the
[43:59] price action okay but these markets here
[44:02] except for the sun summer months and
[44:05] that being like July and August those
[44:08] months can be a little uh hit or miss
[44:12] but the rest of the year they tend to be
[44:16] really nice markets so if you're looking
[44:17] to have your trading business framed on
[44:20] a asset class that is really nice it's
[44:23] professionally delivered where it's not
[44:27] like a bucket shop you know penny stock
[44:29] type Market it's these markets are
[44:32] really nice they're very systematic in
[44:34] the way they do do things and they
[44:36] repeat but if you don't know what you're
[44:38] looking for or understanding Behind
[44:40] These mechanics that I'm outlining here
[44:43] at the very basic
[44:45] level then you can obviously hurt
[44:47] yourself still
[44:49] so right away I'm showing you that there
[44:51] are
[44:52] times in the day that you want to be
[44:54] looking for setups you're not trying to
[44:56] do 25 trades you're not trying to do 30
[44:59] trades you're not in there trying to
[45:01] Micro Scalp you're looking for the real
[45:04] moves in the morning and the real moves
[45:05] in the afternoon and preferably if you
[45:08] get 1 in the morning you don't trade in
[45:09] the afternoon go to a demo and practice
[45:12] there don't give the money back to the
[45:13] marketplace especially while you're you
[45:15] know you're new don't do that and I'm
[45:18] actually telling you not to trade with
[45:19] live funds but I know a lot of you like
[45:23] to see things that are traded with a
[45:26] live account like it's a real um account
[45:29] that shows entries and and things of
[45:33] that nature and that's the things I'm
[45:35] doing this year okay I'm not going to do
[45:37] it in 2023 I'm not going to do it
[45:40] forever okay I did it so that way my
[45:43] students can feel at ease about it
[45:46] because even in my in my paid mentorship
[45:48] group I don't trade live funds there
[45:51] because for my protection I'm doing what
[45:52] I'm showing you right here in a demo but
[45:54] I've been showing Live account trades
[45:56] this to approved it it works so
[45:59] hopefully you found this insightful and
[46:01] until I'll talk to you on Thursday be
[46:03] safe
