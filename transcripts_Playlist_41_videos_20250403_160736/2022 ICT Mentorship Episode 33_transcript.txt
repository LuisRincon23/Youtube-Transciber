[00:05] all right folks welcome back this is our
[00:08] final meeting for the week and this
[00:12] completes my daily review for the 2022
[00:16] ICT free mentorship on YouTube series
[00:21] all right so we finally made a run below
[00:22] that May 12 2022 low
[00:27] here and I want to take your attention
[00:29] in
[00:32] to the hourly
[00:44] chart all right so here's the trading
[00:48] day for Friday and we'll look at
[00:54] this when we get to it
[01:01] all right so we've Consolidated Market
[01:04] ran up took the stop on my final balance
[01:08] on that paper
[01:10] trade we moved up into a deeper fair
[01:13] value Gap creating the high of the
[01:16] day we broke down below the 3915 and a
[01:21] quarter
[01:22] level now for me this was the the
[01:25] turning point that I required like I
[01:27] didn't want to do anything prior to the
[01:30] this run here I did a
[01:34] commentary on the Twitter
[01:38] spaces uh portion of their service or
[01:41] whatever where you basically just get to
[01:43] hear someone talking and I just Jawbone
[01:45] for a little
[01:46] while around 8:30 to 10:00 I spent about
[01:50] 90 minutes just covering a lot of
[01:52] different things from psychological
[01:54] things to personal things and trading
[01:57] and you know how my children
[02:01] are with the exception of
[02:03] one um not
[02:06] really interested in trading but now I
[02:08] have one of my sons that
[02:10] are actively
[02:12] pursuing and now obviously you know he's
[02:15] given me permission to show you his
[02:16] account here um it's a it's a live
[02:22] account there you go you can see
[02:27] uh he got his account up to
[02:31] today
[02:34] here so previous balance I was
[02:37] mentioning and showing you earlier so do
[02:40] a little clip on Twitter previous
[02:42] balance after
[02:43] commissions he had
[02:45] 9,751 66 and today he added another
[02:49] $33,700 to it bringing this balance to $
[02:53] 13,451
[02:54] 66 that would essentially be in 3 weeks
[02:59] like 300
[03:00] 100%
[03:01] return or number one spot on the robins
[03:05] leaderboard in less than a month now
[03:09] obviously amp allows you to trade with a
[03:13] amount of Leverage that is you know
[03:17] exceedingly lower than that of what
[03:20] Robins would do that kind of return
[03:23] obviously is not typical okay I'm not
[03:26] promising any of you that you're going
[03:27] to get that and yes he's my son so he
[03:31] has a lot of experience sitting next to
[03:34] him so when we're looking at charts
[03:36] together um I'm kind of like leaning on
[03:40] my experience and asking him what he
[03:42] sees basically what I'm doing with you
[03:44] all when I'm training you okay I'll
[03:46] prompt you I'll say what do you see here
[03:49] and what do you see there so that way
[03:51] kind of it builds his understanding as
[03:53] the charts are
[03:55] painting and he gets to push the buttons
[03:57] on his own decided whether you he wants
[04:00] to get in or get out and there it is and
[04:04] today I was utilizing That Swing Low
[04:07] there so I wanted to see that break so
[04:10] during the time on Twitter I wasn't
[04:12] really interested in anything until that
[04:15] low was taken out and you can hear that
[04:17] in the discussion um I'm wanting to see
[04:21] this low
[04:22] break I was giving it an opportunity to
[04:24] see if it was going to show a
[04:25] willingness to come up here and run
[04:27] these highs I could have very well
[04:29] happened hit that and then did all this
[04:31] business here U but it just so happens
[04:35] that it breaks the 3915 and a quarter
[04:38] level here and then right in there I'll
[04:40] explain how I personally would have been
[04:42] involved and how I actually was talking
[04:45] to my son about it and these types of
[04:47] ideas helped him you know Propel his
[04:49] account today the market trades below
[04:52] the short-term low here took some sell
[04:54] side out there and then ultimately
[04:57] taking out the 3855 level
[05:00] rather handsomely and we'll look at all
[05:02] this business when we drop down our time
[05:03] frames let's look at the 15-minute time
[05:07] frame all right so here's that fair
[05:09] value gapit worked up into I wasn't
[05:11] interested in all this business back and
[05:13] forth chopping
[05:14] around finally with the 3915 and a
[05:17] quarter level it broke through it and
[05:20] then we had a gap in here which we'll
[05:23] see on the lower time frames that was in
[05:26] my opinion the better trade now some of
[05:30] you are going to look at this and say
[05:31] well it didn't go to a premium I'm
[05:33] teaching you how to find the highest
[05:35] probability and
[05:38] also trusting the model I'm not limited
[05:42] to just one model okay so I I kind of
[05:44] like want to preface it by saying that I
[05:47] don't want you thinking that I'm just
[05:49] this onetick Pony that I can only do
[05:52] what I'm taught in this model I know
[05:55] some of you want me to sit down every
[05:56] single day and give you the example of
[05:58] that model but to do that that takes
[06:03] away that Discovery for you like you got
[06:06] to go into your charts and find them and
[06:07] then by building a backlog of old data
[06:10] showing those types of moves it helps
[06:13] obviously with your confidence it builds
[06:16] your own pattern recognition and it's
[06:20] just that's just the way you are
[06:21] supposed to do it period you know I'm
[06:23] not going to do it for you I'm not going
[06:24] to hold your hand for you I've taught
[06:26] you what it looks like and how to find
[06:27] it where it forms so that way you go
[06:29] through it and you look for it to form
[06:31] in your own charts and collect the
[06:33] examples of it that's back
[06:36] testing so anyway it runs through 372 in
[06:40] a quarter creates another opportunity in
[06:42] here you can actually see the fair value
[06:43] Gap there trades up that's another short
[06:46] worked lower finally creating the
[06:48] short-term low and at 1:30 that's when
[06:52] we start watching the afternoon PM
[06:55] session bit rallies up creates
[06:57] short-term high in here fair value Gap
[07:00] the last hour of
[07:02] trading rallies back up into a fair
[07:04] value Gap here so if you look at the
[07:06] range from here to here it goes back to
[07:07] a premium I taught you that so that's a
[07:10] Target this
[07:11] imbalance Fair Val Gap reversal on
[07:16] Friday's trading up into an old
[07:19] imbalance there okay so my son
[07:22] participated in shorts in here he took
[07:25] two
[07:26] shorts and went long in here all
[07:28] throughout this and was able to again
[07:31] push his account up $3,700 today if we
[07:34] go into a five minute
[07:39] chart here is that same idea where it
[07:43] went created the low 130 it starts doing
[07:46] its business what's it reaching for
[07:48] going to go back into the middle of the
[07:49] range into a
[07:51] premium this is the array above half the
[07:54] move from here to here is 50%
[07:57] equilibrium and this is the premium
[07:58] level so it
[08:00] goes down small little drop down in here
[08:02] into the fair value Gap after 3:00 and
[08:06] then the market starts sending it into
[08:08] an algorithmic spool where all this
[08:11] price action starts running aggressively
[08:13] into the close up into a completely
[08:16] random level that was shown on the on
[08:18] the hourly
[08:20] chart and here we have the market
[08:22] trading right up into that area and then
[08:24] just consolidating going into the
[08:27] close so
[08:31] now the idea of looking for a setup let
[08:34] me go
[08:35] into no let's go into this little area
[08:39] right in
[08:41] here here's that fair value got there it
[08:45] rallies up into it there and there then
[08:49] breaks
[08:51] lower in here there's a fair value Gap
[08:54] it trades up into it there and sells off
[08:58] notice that it's occurring at the levels
[09:00] that I have here on the chart those old
[09:04] lows where sell side would be resting so
[09:06] we're using the fair Bay Gap after a run
[09:09] Below on think of it like support
[09:13] broken return back into the fair Bay Gap
[09:15] not listen folks listen not go back to
[09:19] the old low broken and act as resistance
[09:22] okay that's not how I look at if the
[09:23] fair Bay Gap doesn't exist I don't trust
[09:25] that level as an old support broken turn
[09:28] resistance that's why I try to everybody
[09:29] that comes to me oh he's just trading
[09:32] break and retest or he's trading support
[09:34] and resistance I'm not because I
[09:37] classify specific levels beforehand
[09:40] looking at them with the logic that the
[09:42] Market's going to create these patterns
[09:43] around them same thing here old low the
[09:46] fair value Gap it trades up into it it
[09:48] Why didn't it just stop at the 3872 on a
[09:51] quarter level because it's going into
[09:52] the imbalance here then deliver is going
[09:56] lower so the two shorts were in here in
[10:00] here the
[10:02] Longs in here here and then riding up
[10:06] into the imbalance okay
[10:10] and it's real hard to beat a live
[10:12] account proving it and it's all the
[10:15] better when it's your own son pushing
[10:17] the buttons and seeing it happen so
[10:19] that's just a really good feeling as a
[10:20] dad so hopefully you know with what I
[10:23] shared this week um I gave a lot of
[10:26] content and today I just
[10:30] wanted you to understand what it was and
[10:32] why I was not willing to take a trade
[10:33] yet because I wanted this level the 3915
[10:37] and a quarter level to be broken I
[10:40] wanted that to happen first and to do
[10:43] that because on the 15-minute time
[10:45] frame that gives
[10:48] me that break whereas all up here it's
[10:51] just it's Consolidated I don't want to
[10:53] catch a a break below a short-term low
[10:55] and then then run relative equal highs
[10:57] notice that that's the reason why I'm
[10:59] picking that because I know you're all
[11:00] asking why didn't you use any of these
[11:02] short-term lows being broken you could
[11:05] have if you want to be ultra aggressive
[11:08] I wasn't willing to be ultra aggressive
[11:10] because we have a lot of volatility in
[11:12] these markets right now so I want to
[11:13] know that I know so this short-term low
[11:16] that's why I hadn't noted I told you
[11:18] about it in the commentary today
[11:20] listening to me on
[11:22] Twitter breaking
[11:25] through you don't see the Gap here on
[11:28] the that time frame but it's appearing
[11:30] on the 5 minute chart and that's what my
[11:33] son employed as his trade and then down
[11:37] in here there was another trade and down
[11:39] in here there was another trade and then
[11:40] here is a trade so the key levels that I
[11:44] note they're not just indiscriminate
[11:46] levels they're levels that are built on
[11:48] the logic
[11:50] and it's based on liquidity not support
[11:54] and resistance it's liquidity the orders
[11:57] I know are going to be there based on
[11:59] the logic that the Market's likely to do
[12:02] what it's going to reach for that 3855
[12:06] level only if we break below here and
[12:09] then we have a fair value Gap and then
[12:11] we break this level here and does it get
[12:13] another fair value Gap yes and then
[12:16] delivers even more so it's a matter of
[12:19] all these things coming together as a
[12:21] Confluence not just one
[12:23] thing you know leading to that's the
[12:26] conclusion that's the uh the exercise
[12:29] of the pushing of the
[12:32] button it requires a lot more things and
[12:35] that's kind of like what I was helping
[12:37] you with yesterday and hopefully this
[12:39] morning if I
[12:40] was successful at least I was hoping I
[12:43] was successful some of you are really uh
[12:46] coming back with feedback on Twitter
[12:47] saying it was it was helpful and You'
[12:49] seen it some of you actually took trades
[12:51] some of you actually did demo and paper
[12:53] trades and and you see it you actually
[12:56] participated in it but when I said this
[12:58] morning when I was closing the
[13:00] presentation on Twitter where I was
[13:01] audibly heard you can't see my charts I
[13:04] was kind of like discussing things in
[13:06] certain
[13:08] levels what I was saying was I don't
[13:11] have a setup yet it's sloppy and what it
[13:13] was doing is all of this in here okay so
[13:16] as we got to the 10 o'clock hour I told
[13:19] you I wanted to be off air at 10 o'clock
[13:22] because I'm anticipating the algorithm
[13:23] taking that low out and it does and then
[13:25] it creates the pattern I taught you
[13:28] which is the fair value Gap
[13:29] we have the displacement and I want to
[13:32] see it take off now if you look at this
[13:36] displacement leg here you're going to
[13:38] want to measure that and say well okay
[13:39] it didn't go to a What
[13:42] premium I don't expect it to go to a
[13:44] premium in here because it's going to be
[13:45] in a hurry to do what get down below
[13:48] that 3855 level for the week so let's go
[13:51] one more time back
[13:53] into the lower time frame actually the
[13:56] first time going in the lower time frame
[13:59] scrub back
[14:02] [Music]
[14:08] here okay so here is that return and the
[14:10] defair Val Gap
[14:12] here so when it does this I'm looking
[14:16] for it to move quickly away and start
[14:20] gravitating towards the other pool of
[14:22] liquidity down
[14:23] here if you're looking at it from the
[14:26] relationship of
[14:33] short-term dealing range this swing High
[14:36] That Swing
[14:37] Low we have our fair value Gap here it
[14:40] trades up into it
[14:42] there and that level 395 and a quarter
[14:47] so it's a Confluence of several things
[14:49] but the level itself just highlights
[14:50] where the liquidity would be the
[14:52] imbalance is what I'm keying off of and
[14:55] what I'm focusing on so equal
[14:59] equilibrium or above is What premium
[15:01] that's what this is here okay that's on
[15:04] one minute chart so don't be discouraged
[15:06] or look at it from a perspective that
[15:09] hey you know the market didn't go to a
[15:12] premium you just don't have the
[15:13] experience to see it yet you gotta you
[15:16] have to do this for a while folks it
[15:17] isn't a watch one time and then you know
[15:20] it like it it takes some effort on your
[15:23] part but I promise you if you work at it
[15:26] you're gonna get it you're gonna get it
[15:29] and then once you have it you can't
[15:30] forget it it's like riding a bicycle
[15:33] okay so hopefully this has been
[15:36] insightful to you hopefully you learned
[15:37] something this week hopefully I was able
[15:39] to uh Propel your understanding a little
[15:42] bit beyond what you were thinking was
[15:45] about all you're going to get from me
[15:48] for 2022 I have obviously some more
[15:50] things I want to share with you but
[15:52] hopefully you know you enjoyed this week
[15:54] with me and I'll touch space with you on
[15:56] next Tuesday Lord willing until then
[15:58] enjoy weekend be safe
