[00:15] all right folks how you doing hope
[00:16] everybody's doing well
[00:18] and this is just a
[00:20] kind of like a prep to get your mindset
[00:22] correct on what's coming in two days and
[00:25] on the youtube channel
[00:27] i want you to understand going forward
[00:30] that
[00:31] obviously you are
[00:34] familiar with my moniker i've dubbed
[00:35] myself the demo baller
[00:38] and
[00:38] i've always talked through the medium of
[00:40] a demo account for my own protection
[00:43] and i've had students come in to my fold
[00:46] and
[00:47] question whether or not it was
[00:49] something that could work in live
[00:51] accounts because they themselves
[00:53] couldn't make it work
[00:55] in either a demo or paper trading
[00:57] because either they could not find it in
[00:59] themselves to submit to the process and
[01:02] the time required for their own
[01:03] individual development or
[01:05] they rushed and did things foolishly
[01:08] outside of the instructions that i
[01:10] provide
[01:11] in mentoring
[01:13] so there's a
[01:16] small faction of
[01:19] individuals on the internet that believe
[01:21] that these things that i teach don't
[01:22] work in a live account
[01:24] and it's never really been an interest
[01:27] in
[01:28] me really to see people
[01:31] fall over me and believe everything i
[01:34] say
[01:35] i've challenged everyone
[01:37] to put the things i teach to test see if
[01:40] the things i'm teaching you are in fact
[01:42] in the marketplace do they deliver
[01:45] more times than that
[01:47] does it
[01:48] provide you a way of finding consistency
[01:51] over a week not every single day
[01:53] perfection because i can't provide that
[01:55] i don't even trade perfectly like that
[01:57] a new trader can new teacher can provide
[01:59] 100 accuracy
[02:02] but
[02:03] the way i teach and the way you'll see
[02:05] me mentoring on this channel in two days
[02:07] is i take the earners okay all of you
[02:11] that are not trading yet or have tried
[02:14] trading and failed
[02:16] you're yearning to learn how to do this
[02:19] okay so
[02:20] i'm teaching with that mindset now some
[02:22] of you obviously may have already been
[02:24] with me and found some consistency and
[02:26] some of you are doing exceedingly well
[02:28] and that's amazing that's great and i'm
[02:30] thankful for all of that
[02:31] but
[02:32] this is really meant for
[02:36] specifically
[02:38] it's for my daughter okay so i sat down
[02:40] and figured i'd kill two birds at one
[02:42] stone
[02:43] and
[02:44] if i can show a simplistic way of going
[02:47] in using the things that i teach
[02:49] stripping it down
[02:50] to
[02:51] its chrome
[02:53] okay no bells and whistles no advanced
[02:56] theories or anything like that what can
[02:59] i do to provide a model that my daughter
[03:03] could look at and say okay there's not a
[03:04] lot of moving parts it's real simple for
[03:06] me to decide what it is i want to do and
[03:08] also when not to do something okay and
[03:12] some of you may already be
[03:14] completely upset with that idea because
[03:17] you want me to come out here and lay an
[03:19] arsenal in your hands of high-tech
[03:22] weaponry
[03:25] it's
[03:26] been my experience that the highest form
[03:29] of analysis concepts that i've been
[03:31] teaching in my own personal mentorship
[03:34] many times creates
[03:36] exceptional traders yes
[03:38] but
[03:38] the majority of them
[03:41] in them being my students
[03:43] they get bogged down in all of the
[03:45] content and it just creates
[03:48] analysis paralysis and it's just too
[03:50] many things for them to decide because
[03:52] like kid in the candy store
[03:54] you know what do you eat first and while
[03:55] you're still chewing on the first thing
[03:57] what are you going to reach for next
[03:59] okay so if you don't have discipline and
[04:01] this is a personal responsibility
[04:03] characteristic that all of you gonna
[04:04] have to
[04:07] really
[04:08] assume okay because i can lay the things
[04:11] in your hands
[04:12] but
[04:14] if you don't respect the fact that they
[04:16] have sharp edges
[04:18] okay or
[04:20] if you use live ammunition before you're
[04:23] really properly trained you could hurt
[04:25] yourself okay
[04:26] so with that idea in mind um
[04:31] i'll be teaching
[04:32] a stripped down version
[04:34] of
[04:36] my concepts in a mentorship
[04:38] style
[04:40] so that way you can go through the
[04:41] process of learning how to do
[04:43] a specific trading model
[04:45] and i'll keep things germane to that
[04:48] model not trying to bring in too many
[04:49] things
[04:50] and one of the approaches is to trade it
[04:53] with index features okay and if you are
[04:57] not interested in trading futures that's
[04:59] fine you can still trade
[05:01] 4x with these concepts as well but i
[05:04] kind of like want to drive it with
[05:05] futures
[05:06] i actually began trading in 1992 as a
[05:10] commodity and futures trader and i moved
[05:12] away from grains and cattle and gold
[05:15] silver crude oil all those types of
[05:16] markets and moved into
[05:19] the bond market the 30-year treasury
[05:21] bond and the s p
[05:24] so when that
[05:26] became my cup of tea if you will
[05:30] i became a better trader intraday
[05:33] and i put down the pursuit of trying to
[05:35] be a long term position trader because i
[05:36] felt that that would be the best thing
[05:38] for me because at the time i was working
[05:40] a job and had to balance all those
[05:42] things like working class individuals
[05:44] need to do they have to commute back and
[05:45] forth to work and those types of things
[05:47] so
[05:47] i figured position trading would be the
[05:49] thing for me and i found out that it
[05:51] didn't work for me okay so i liked the
[05:54] idea of short-term trading intraday
[05:55] trading it made sense to me because i
[05:57] can make quick decisions
[05:59] that may not be
[06:01] your style of trading i will teach you
[06:04] how to apply the things i'm going to
[06:05] teach
[06:07] on the youtube channel how you can scale
[06:09] that up into any time frame so that way
[06:10] there's no excuse for you not to be able
[06:12] to use the information to at least
[06:14] better your understanding in price
[06:15] action okay so here's my promises to you
[06:19] i promise you you're going to learn
[06:21] things that absolutely repeat
[06:24] a lot
[06:26] you are not going
[06:28] to be perfect it's not my goal to make
[06:30] you a perfect trader it's not my goal to
[06:33] make you a perfect analyst
[06:35] my goal is to improve your understanding
[06:37] about price action how price is
[06:39] delivered
[06:40] and how to read the bias on an intraday
[06:43] basis a daily basis and
[06:45] hopefully over a short-term period of
[06:47] time you can find setups that repeat
[06:50] and they have common characteristics
[06:52] that are very similar
[06:54] but they won't be identical no no they
[06:56] won't be
[06:58] carbon copies but you'll see
[06:59] similarities that to know and trust that
[07:02] this is a setup that you are familiar
[07:04] with okay
[07:05] and because you were all
[07:08] being viewed as
[07:10] yearners okay you are all yearning to
[07:12] learn how to do this
[07:14] there's three stages in this youtube
[07:16] mentorship okay i'm treating you all as
[07:19] green horns okay you're just yearning to
[07:22] do this a lot of you
[07:24] that begin this youtube mentorship will
[07:26] not complete it because you're gonna get
[07:28] frustrated because you want something
[07:29] else
[07:30] or a
[07:32] alternative a way of
[07:34] me teaching it to you i'm not going to
[07:36] take suggestions from anybody on how to
[07:38] teach it differently this is the way i'm
[07:40] going to teach it so it's as is
[07:43] it will not be setups given to you for
[07:45] trades but i will take your attention
[07:47] before the fact and draw them
[07:50] out on a chart where i want you to study
[07:52] where price will likely draw to next
[07:55] and using the things i teach you
[07:56] conceptually it's your job to study that
[07:59] okay do not look at that as a trade
[08:02] setup do not look at that as a
[08:03] enticement to take a live trade
[08:05] so it's my
[08:07] intentions
[08:08] to take
[08:09] the yearners that want to learn how to
[08:11] do this through a process of becoming
[08:15] structured learners
[08:17] so you're going from yearning to
[08:18] learning and hopefully at your
[08:21] discretion and timing you'll become an
[08:23] earner okay so
[08:25] learner
[08:27] earner okay
[08:28] so
[08:29] those three stages
[08:31] are what i'm going to take you through
[08:34] it's not going to be an entire year
[08:36] mentorship i'm going to do probably
[08:38] three or four months
[08:39] but before we get into it i want you to
[08:41] know that
[08:42] i will not be providing any content to
[08:45] the youtube channel or
[08:48] my own personal mentorship
[08:49] during the month of march okay so march
[08:52] 2022
[08:53] i will not be
[08:55] doing anything i'll be on vacation and
[08:57] we're gonna be doing several road trips
[08:59] so i will not be
[09:02] working for you
[09:03] okay
[09:04] so if
[09:06] you can accept that then i think over
[09:08] the next coming months
[09:09] it should be rather entertaining and
[09:12] interesting for you as a student
[09:16] so you're looking at this screen here
[09:17] and one of the things i promised i would
[09:19] do in 2022 is to
[09:21] show you
[09:23] how some of these concepts would work in
[09:26] an environment outside of a demo account
[09:29] i've always used the moniker
[09:32] demo baller because
[09:34] that's my name i gave myself that to
[09:37] kind of like
[09:39] champion the idea that i'm teaching
[09:40] through a demo but if i can teach you
[09:43] through a demo and things are repeating
[09:45] you can see your charts
[09:46] okay whether it's a live platform or if
[09:48] it's a demo you're seeing the things
[09:50] that i teach and if you've been
[09:53] fortunate enough to be in my presence
[09:54] when i'm calling it beforehand
[09:56] it's very rewarding and you all on
[09:58] youtube will have those experiences as
[10:00] well
[10:02] but the main thing is for you not to
[10:04] grow a dependency on me pointing to
[10:06] everything before it happens because if
[10:07] you do that or if you have that mindset
[10:09] going in it's going to stunt your growth
[10:11] and in fact it's going to create a
[10:12] barrier for you
[10:14] because it'll create a codependency
[10:16] state of mind and i don't want that i
[10:18] try to foster a
[10:20] independent mindset where you're
[10:22] independently coming to the decisions on
[10:24] your own it's that way the results are
[10:26] yours if it's success you own it if you
[10:28] failed you own that too i can't co-sign
[10:31] for your failure and some of you
[10:33] absolutely will fail i said this many
[10:35] times openly and
[10:37] every time i've been asked
[10:39] in 2016 i started a paid mentorship
[10:43] and i have students from that time
[10:45] period that are still trying to find
[10:47] their way and they cannot make these
[10:49] things work for themselves
[10:51] i have other students from 2016 that are
[10:53] absolutely
[10:55] mind-blowing results and i have students
[10:57] from my mentorship group that was the
[10:59] final class in 2021 i'm not taking new
[11:01] enrollment so don't ask
[11:03] that group i have traders that are doing
[11:06] very well as well so it's not a
[11:08] shortcoming on what it is they're being
[11:10] taught it's just an individual unique
[11:12] experience that you have to grow and go
[11:14] through and i can't speed it up for you
[11:17] any more than i already done so i'm
[11:19] optimistic but i'm a realist i know some
[11:21] of you simply will not do the things i
[11:23] ask you to do you will not do them
[11:25] effectively and you'll try to short
[11:28] cut certain things and you'll think that
[11:30] you don't need to do this and don't do
[11:31] that and your results will be
[11:35] reduced
[11:36] because of that so if i suggest things
[11:39] to you drills homework things to study
[11:43] do your best to participate in that okay
[11:46] and
[11:47] even if you can't do it live
[11:49] you know there's other ways to go
[11:51] through and look at it it's not the same
[11:53] as seeing it live but it's
[11:56] the best you can do because some of you
[11:57] have businesses some of you have school
[12:00] jobs okay let's be real
[12:02] and you may have family things that keep
[12:04] you also from being able to watch live
[12:07] data in the times i'm asking you to do
[12:09] it
[12:10] i'm not going to jump through hoops i'm
[12:12] not going to do acrobatics to make it
[12:14] you know feasible for every single one
[12:16] of you okay it's unrealistic for you any
[12:17] of you to have that expectation of me
[12:19] because i don't need to be doing this i
[12:21] love doing it i'm looking forward to
[12:22] doing it but i want to make sure all of
[12:24] you have the right mindset okay
[12:27] so in 2022 i promised that you would see
[12:30] how these
[12:32] concepts work
[12:34] in an environment outside of a demo
[12:36] account and what would that mean
[12:38] well it would mean
[12:40] not well not an mt4 platform because
[12:43] years ago it's been shown how frauds and
[12:47] fakes can use that platform to pretend
[12:50] that they're profitable that they can
[12:52] find setups and that their trading is
[12:54] amazing
[12:56] and they can go in and edit their trades
[12:58] after the fact after the market's
[13:00] already moved
[13:01] well i've already proven that i don't do
[13:02] those types of things and i went to
[13:04] tradingview and that was the platform
[13:06] that i asked my community so which which
[13:08] platform should i use if i'm going away
[13:10] from mt4
[13:12] i want to go to a platform that's
[13:13] reputable so i teach and you'll see me
[13:16] teaching through
[13:17] tradingview so that's the medium that we
[13:19] use
[13:21] it's familiar to me because i'm teaching
[13:23] mentorship students through that but
[13:26] if that's not your platform of choice
[13:29] you're just going to have to get used to
[13:30] me teaching through that medium because
[13:31] i'm not going to do something in
[13:33] addition to okay
[13:35] but for
[13:37] a live account
[13:38] i felt that
[13:41] td ameritrade is very reputable
[13:44] and that it is
[13:46] regulated by the commodity futures
[13:47] trading commission and all of the other
[13:49] gardening bodies
[13:50] uh i cannot
[13:52] rig this to make it look like i'm
[13:53] smarter okay i can't go back in and
[13:56] change
[13:57] a trade
[13:58] i can't fix it okay i can't add lipstick
[14:01] to it okay it either is or isn't
[14:04] a profitable trade okay it's as simple
[14:07] as that
[14:08] td ameritrade uses
[14:10] the
[14:11] margins
[14:12] that are accepted and
[14:15] established in the industry
[14:17] and some of you may not be able to
[14:20] trade a market because of margin don't
[14:22] let that be a hindrance i'll show you
[14:24] how to work around that
[14:25] in other platforms while i don't
[14:27] personally use an mt4 account
[14:30] for teachings or or trading live funds
[14:33] or anything like that
[14:34] i'm
[14:35] confident that students that are trying
[14:38] to learn how to do this they can still
[14:40] use mt4 or mt5 or any other platform for
[14:44] that matter
[14:45] i as an educator though
[14:47] moved away from those
[14:48] platforms because they can be gained
[14:51] okay in other words they can be used to
[14:53] fraud
[14:54] and
[14:55] fake
[14:56] results okay so in treating you you've
[14:59] seen examples after examples of me going
[15:01] in recording an entry
[15:04] calling the moves as it happens without
[15:06] the replay button because replay doesn't
[15:07] let you do
[15:08] trade entries okay and replay only shows
[15:11] you a completed candlestick it doesn't
[15:13] show you the generation of the open all
[15:16] the price action up and down to the
[15:18] close of every individual candlestick so
[15:22] i've had a lot of folks
[15:24] over the years asked me to show live
[15:26] account show live account show live
[15:28] account
[15:30] and
[15:31] one of the things that kept me from
[15:32] wanting to do is because if i show
[15:34] results of any kind
[15:36] right away
[15:38] and this is how i viewed it too as a
[15:41] developing student in the 1990s
[15:43] that
[15:44] made me feel like
[15:46] i'm never going to get it because their
[15:47] results were way above
[15:49] what i could do as a
[15:51] learning
[15:52] developing student i had no idea what i
[15:54] was doing in 1992
[15:56] but to see people say yeah i made fifty
[15:58] thousand dollars in the soybean market
[16:00] okay or i made eighty thousand dollars
[16:02] in coffee
[16:03] well
[16:06] that to me was a very
[16:09] huge mountain decline like i have to do
[16:13] that
[16:14] it just it felt impossible
[16:17] but i also didn't want to give results
[16:19] that were so low end that it didn't
[16:22] inspire an interest in
[16:24] having people want to learn it
[16:26] so because this business is extremely
[16:30] unique and personal
[16:32] it's both the easiest thing you'll ever
[16:34] do and sometimes
[16:37] for many of you is the most impossible
[16:39] thing to be successful at and that
[16:41] sounds like an oxymoron it sounds like
[16:44] double talk and it is but it isn't how's
[16:47] that for
[16:48] a rib
[16:50] you can't
[16:52] appreciate how difficult it is until you
[16:54] start treating life funds
[16:56] but before you start treatment life
[16:57] funds
[16:58] in your in the consistently
[17:00] quote unquote profitable demo trading
[17:02] stage you feel like you can do anything
[17:05] but something magical happens when you
[17:06] go into a live account where now
[17:08] suddenly every little tick means
[17:10] something to you
[17:12] because it means
[17:13] success or failure on an individual
[17:15] basis whereas if you lose in a demo
[17:17] account yeah you didn't really lose
[17:18] anything
[17:20] you can take another demo trade but with
[17:23] live account trading
[17:25] you have to deal with that drawdown
[17:27] in that loss
[17:28] and making money in an account is
[17:30] sometimes worse than losing money
[17:32] because it will make you feel like you
[17:34] want another taste of that and it
[17:36] creates opportunities for you to go into
[17:37] over trade
[17:38] and or over leverage and both of those
[17:40] things we'll talk about in the youtube
[17:42] mentorship
[17:44] how to avoid some of those things
[17:46] but it's up to you
[17:47] to avoid them okay and
[17:50] it takes a lot of ownership
[17:52] personally and the responsibility that
[17:54] is required to do this is
[17:57] paramount okay you cannot have anybody
[18:00] else
[18:01] take responsibility for your actions
[18:03] it's your actions and if you do well you
[18:06] earned it
[18:07] if you don't do well you hate you have
[18:09] to eat it okay it's the way it is
[18:11] and too many people are weak-minded in
[18:14] this world that they will never become
[18:17] successful traders no matter who teaches
[18:18] them what whatever thing they use
[18:21] they're gonna be a failure okay that's
[18:23] just the way it is and there's no way
[18:24] around that i can't fix
[18:26] and improve everyone's shortcomings
[18:29] i have my own personal issues that i
[18:31] fight and wrestle with internally and
[18:34] it's not easy
[18:36] like i'm obsessively compulsive and i
[18:38] have i have adv it's
[18:41] all these things okay that
[18:44] make it difficult for me and i'm bipolar
[18:45] so i have a lot of mental
[18:48] barriers
[18:49] but if i can sit down
[18:51] and frame out an idea that
[18:53] repeats at least once a week
[18:56] i'm confident that those individuals out
[18:58] there that are like me or without these
[19:00] barriers
[19:01] can do it as well that's my personal
[19:03] belief it doesn't make it fact it
[19:04] doesn't make it true it just means
[19:06] that's my belief and i've seen
[19:09] case studies in my own students where
[19:11] that's true
[19:12] it's a transferable
[19:15] skill
[19:16] but the skill must be honed
[19:18] by you the student
[19:20] so anyway i promised i would show some
[19:22] results
[19:23] in 2022 outside of a demo account so i
[19:26] used td ameritrade but years ago i was
[19:29] asked to show a
[19:31] regulated broker
[19:33] non-mt4
[19:34] and
[19:35] i felt that td ameritrade was a better
[19:39] choice
[19:40] outside of
[19:41] you know the standard
[19:43] forex account brokers because with td
[19:45] ameritrade you can trade forex you can
[19:47] trade futures you can trade
[19:49] commodities stocks options you can bond
[19:51] up everything out there you can treat it
[19:53] okay so
[19:55] eventually over time if you do become
[19:57] successful when you're profitable you
[19:59] want to go with a broker that allows you
[20:00] to have access to all those vehicles
[20:03] because there's certain times of the
[20:05] year certain asset classes just aren't
[20:06] going to do very well but others will in
[20:09] this type of broker
[20:11] and i'm not repping td ameritrade i
[20:12] don't get anything for it i'm not an
[20:14] introducing broker i'm just saying that
[20:17] when i'm showing results
[20:19] in an account that is not demo
[20:22] this is the broker that i deposited
[20:25] funds with so that way we know what i'm
[20:28] saying here i'm not telling you to go
[20:29] here and trade okay
[20:32] i have
[20:34] only traded a few trades with this
[20:37] broker but i can tell you their fills
[20:39] are immediate
[20:40] their confirmations are
[20:42] solid i haven't had any
[20:45] problems
[20:46] technically it's just i'm fumbling with
[20:49] the layouts the way things are
[20:54] made available to me because it's just
[20:55] like anything else when i'm transitioned
[20:57] from mt4
[20:59] teaching from that being very
[21:00] comfortable that going into
[21:02] treating view
[21:04] it's very cumbersome and i'm still
[21:07] clumsy with it when i'm teaching
[21:09] and
[21:10] i'm finding it a little bit cumbersome
[21:13] here as well because i just don't know
[21:14] where they have certain things i don't
[21:16] know how to
[21:18] make the charts
[21:19] scalable as faces i want them to be
[21:22] and like i'm used to doing it with
[21:23] tradestation or tradingview or mt4
[21:27] so it's just a learning process but it
[21:28] doesn't change the fact that if you know
[21:30] how to trade then
[21:31] the trades are easy
[21:33] so i keep everything very simple you
[21:34] know i use
[21:36] limits and markets
[21:37] to get in and i just collapse a trade
[21:39] when it gets to a target of my choice so
[21:44] that's all i'm showing you here today
[21:46] it's just to show you that the things
[21:48] i'm going to be showing you
[21:50] are applicable
[21:52] on paper
[21:53] and in demo
[21:54] and the same logic is used here and
[21:57] while this is not a lot of money it's
[21:58] only twenty three thousand was it six
[22:00] hundred ninety four dollars and eleven
[22:02] cents
[22:02] it's not
[22:05] something to brag about let's just put
[22:06] it that way but it's something that's
[22:09] not demo it's something that won't stay
[22:13] at that level and my objective is
[22:16] to teach conceptually
[22:19] a hypothetical income based strategy
[22:22] okay it's not a
[22:24] trying to beat the world cup
[22:27] okay it's not
[22:28] trying to do better than every instagram
[22:30] trader out there it's just
[22:32] trying to teach
[22:33] how someone can take
[22:36] another opportunity and hopefully in the
[22:38] best case scenario and i can't guarantee
[22:40] or promise it to you but i'm going to
[22:42] certainly do my best to do what i know
[22:44] and how i can teach it so that way you
[22:47] can be at least inspired to make an
[22:48] attempt to try
[22:50] okay
[22:51] and because i believe that things are
[22:52] about to get really really hard for
[22:54] everyone
[22:55] financially
[22:56] and
[22:58] without going into great detail just
[22:59] look around the world and you know what
[23:00] i'm talking about
[23:02] but
[23:03] this is the e-mini s p march delivery
[23:06] contract for 2022 okay and it's a two
[23:09] minute chart
[23:10] and i want you to see
[23:12] the
[23:13] port of entry here
[23:15] this is a short it took
[23:18] and the cover was here
[23:22] and
[23:23] another one here a small little scalp
[23:26] and then here
[23:29] and then
[23:31] over here i'm showing you so that way
[23:33] you can see there was no other
[23:35] trades after that short or two shorts
[23:38] rather and then today i slept in
[23:40] and i just want to have something in
[23:42] addition to what i already have here
[23:49] this is kind of like one of the setups
[23:51] that you're going to learn
[23:52] in the mentorship
[23:54] where
[23:55] the entries here
[23:59] and exits here
[24:02] okay not a lot of handles okay handle
[24:04] would be like 45 67 to 45 68.
[24:08] so that's four ticks or one full handle
[24:11] in this market it's 50 per handle
[24:14] or per four ticks so every one tick is
[24:17] twelve dollars and fifty cents
[24:20] above this high
[24:22] is buy stops and i was targeting that
[24:24] here
[24:25] running into that okay so
[24:27] very very simple strategy
[24:28] optimal trade entry you don't need to
[24:30] get in at this level here okay i'm going
[24:32] to teach you how to have forgiving
[24:35] entries
[24:36] you don't need to be highly precise
[24:38] about your entries but you need to be
[24:39] precise about the directional bias and
[24:40] where it's going okay where's price
[24:43] reaching for
[24:44] and that's kind of like what i'm showing
[24:46] you in this mentorship on the youtube
[24:48] channel so if i have
[24:51] at least
[24:54] given you the opportunity to find setups
[24:57] conceptually
[24:58] if that's the case
[25:00] then
[25:01] over time if you submit yourself to it
[25:04] you'll find more setups than you'd ever
[25:07] imagine because they're there a lot in
[25:10] excess of these lower time frames
[25:12] so
[25:13] in a nutshell what am i saying here i'm
[25:15] saying that if you can learn how to take
[25:17] 25 handles
[25:19] okay if you can take 25 handles out of a
[25:22] market like the e-mini s p
[25:25] you may not have the margin
[25:28] 12 13 000 or whatever it is to trade one
[25:31] contract of this market you don't need
[25:33] to have that you can trade the micros
[25:37] and while you're not making fifty
[25:38] dollars per handle on e-mini s p you're
[25:40] making five dollars per handle you can
[25:42] still graduate over time and build that
[25:44] up and it's not a lot of
[25:46] initial margin that's required to do
[25:48] that
[25:49] or if you're outside the u.s you can
[25:51] trade a cfd
[25:53] and trade the u.s 500 market
[25:57] through like an mt4
[25:59] account
[26:00] and again
[26:02] i'm just going to touch on that i'm not
[26:03] suggesting that you should especially
[26:05] those individuals in the states because
[26:06] it's actually illegal for you to trade
[26:08] that because it doesn't go through a
[26:09] regulated extreme exchange like a
[26:11] futures market would so that makes it
[26:13] illegal for us traders to do that
[26:16] so we have to in the u.s trade through
[26:18] the futures market and they have been
[26:20] nice enough to provide micro
[26:22] accounts for vehicles like the e-mini s
[26:24] p
[26:25] and the nasdaq
[26:27] they have micro accounts so
[26:29] whatever the multiplier would be on the
[26:32] regular mini
[26:33] it's just reduced
[26:35] to a smaller level in terms of margin
[26:38] and tick value
[26:40] and i'll cover all that stuff it's i've
[26:42] made it very very simple or at least
[26:43] that's been the goal i'm having going
[26:45] into this i'll make it very very simple
[26:46] for all of you
[26:47] to look at it
[26:49] say okay i don't have to have a thousand
[26:50] moving parts i can go in and simply look
[26:52] at things that make sense
[26:55] and if you can visually understand what
[26:56] it is i'm teaching
[26:58] you'll see that it doesn't require a lot
[26:59] of chart graffiti okay things that are
[27:02] very distracting do you look at this
[27:03] chart here and see a lot of things that
[27:05] would be mysterious no very simple
[27:07] little things i'll draw a line to
[27:08] highlight a level that i want to see
[27:10] breached
[27:11] okay and a level where i want to see it
[27:13] reach up into and that's the basis of
[27:17] understanding how the markets work
[27:19] within a liquidity
[27:21] matrix you have buy side and sell side
[27:24] and once you have that understanding and
[27:26] i'll teach some of those things in the
[27:27] mentorship
[27:29] you'll be able to find setups that
[27:30] repeat
[27:31] at least one good setup a week
[27:34] but if you can find 25 handles a week
[27:37] in the e-mini market
[27:40] you can do very very well with that
[27:42] very very well you don't need to hit
[27:44] home runs
[27:45] and here's my inspiration to you in
[27:47] closing
[27:49] if we're looking at a market that
[27:52] provides uh setups
[27:54] and let's just say your mortgage
[27:57] or your rent
[27:58] is say 1500 it may not be that much it
[28:01] may be actually more than that i'm just
[28:03] going to say let's say it's 1500
[28:06] what happens if you can earn enough
[28:08] to make 50 or all of that a month
[28:12] going forward
[28:14] would that not be beneficial to you
[28:17] that's the mindset i want you all to
[28:18] have or let's say you have a car mode
[28:20] in your car payment and your car
[28:22] insurance
[28:23] if you could find a way to have that
[28:25] money
[28:26] come to you by your own speculation over
[28:29] time not right away i'm not suggesting
[28:31] all of you are going to do this in the
[28:32] same year
[28:34] but over time if you submit to the
[28:35] process i outlined for you
[28:37] my belief is my personal belief my
[28:40] honest opinion is i believe that it is
[28:42] possible now anyone can say oh
[28:45] anything's possible
[28:47] but i believe the things i'm going to
[28:48] show you
[28:50] are things that you'll be able to spot
[28:52] on your own now i'm going to coach you
[28:54] throughout the coming months showing you
[28:56] where certain things may deliver
[28:59] but i don't want you
[29:01] to
[29:02] feel like you need that
[29:04] so i'll teach you how to anticipate
[29:06] certain things on your own and then you
[29:07] check
[29:08] yourself with the things i reveal or do
[29:11] a review with
[29:13] and
[29:14] my belief is that you'll be better at
[29:17] reading price
[29:18] when i'm done doing this youtube
[29:19] internship
[29:21] and again i don't think i'm going to be
[29:22] doing more than four months and that
[29:24] four months is actually including
[29:26] the month of march where nothing
[29:28] nothing's getting uploaded nothing in my
[29:30] private mentorship or on youtube so i
[29:32] will be
[29:33] vacationing that entire month so i'll be
[29:35] doing those
[29:36] things during the month of march and
[29:37] then in april i'll return back to the
[29:40] mentor
[29:42] that i am in my private mentorship and
[29:44] i'll return back to the delivery of the
[29:47] lessons on the youtube channel so what
[29:49] does this schedule look like
[29:52] for this mentorship on youtube
[29:54] obviously friday will be your first
[29:56] episode
[29:57] and then it'll be a tuesday and thursday
[30:00] upload
[30:01] there will be
[30:04] assignments and pdf files
[30:06] provided for your learning
[30:09] throughout the week i'm not promising
[30:11] any specific schedule on that but you'll
[30:14] be able to see them if you go to my
[30:16] community tab i'll
[30:18] provide a way for you to get to the
[30:20] information and download it
[30:22] and i think that if you submit to this
[30:25] you'll be
[30:27] far better than you are right now about
[30:29] reading price
[30:30] expecting
[30:31] certain things to deliver
[30:33] and you'll find that it's not as
[30:36] challenging when you have a good mentor
[30:38] and you have sound logic
[30:40] and it's not over complicated and that's
[30:42] my goal going in and until talk to you
[30:44] on friday
[30:46] be safe
