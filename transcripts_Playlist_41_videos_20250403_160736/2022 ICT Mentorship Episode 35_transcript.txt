[00:05] all right folks welcome back so lord
[00:07] willing after the holiday weekend i'll
[00:10] be back next tuesday
[00:13] so here we have the e-mini s p daily
[00:15] chart
[00:16] and you can see we have a nice delivery
[00:18] to the upside
[00:20] and this will draw what's inside this
[00:23] area in here
[00:24] up into the bearish order block
[00:26] now notice that we traded up
[00:28] into this up close candle
[00:31] with today's range
[00:32] didn't quite take out this high i think
[00:34] that's the next area to look for
[00:36] but in here
[00:38] when we're looking at a candle that
[00:40] we're using for like an older block
[00:42] the low the open
[00:45] in the middle of the range
[00:46] those are the three sensitive areas
[00:49] that you're watching for
[00:50] if the market trades up into
[00:54] the middle point of that
[00:56] candle this is what i call the mean
[00:57] threshold
[00:58] mean threshold was taken today
[01:02] and that to me
[01:03] bodes well for a continuation to take
[01:05] out this short-term high
[01:08] so if you take your fib and you run it
[01:10] across this candle
[01:11] to 50 level
[01:14] all right here's the 50 minute time
[01:15] frame here's yesterday's trading
[01:17] turned up into that small little area
[01:19] down here into that low
[01:21] i mentioned that was going to be a
[01:23] likely candidate for
[01:25] upside
[01:26] relative equal highs as well
[01:28] we traded back down into a fair value
[01:30] gap
[01:31] optimal trade entry rallies up takes out
[01:34] buy sell equity above the short term
[01:36] high back here which i don't
[01:37] unfortunately have in my chart but you
[01:39] can see that on your own 15 minute
[01:40] timeframe
[01:42] and then we consolidated ahead of today
[01:44] and then
[01:46] during the crossover into new york
[01:48] midnight
[01:49] a small little judah swing where it
[01:51] drops down increase the low of the day
[01:54] rallies
[01:55] leaves relative equal highs in here and
[01:57] this high intact
[01:59] it drops down
[02:00] rallies once more
[02:02] small little retracement and then it
[02:04] does a shallow
[02:06] run above 4 000 on this pass through
[02:08] here
[02:09] in this small little area on a lower
[02:11] time frame i used this little
[02:14] retracement
[02:15] to highlight a run to 4 000 because i
[02:18] gave you guys 4 000 was my objective
[02:21] it hit it and then we press deeper into
[02:23] the order block on the daily chart which
[02:25] creates this whole run here now i'm
[02:26] going to go into the details about that
[02:28] here
[02:29] but for now just know that we were
[02:31] trading up to this level failed to go to
[02:33] that same level consolidated right below
[02:37] that
[02:37] daily bearish order block
[02:40] that's the low of the candle
[02:43] that creates that daily bearish order
[02:44] block and then the opening
[02:46] when that counts a little bit higher i
[02:48] think it's four thousand two but don't
[02:50] pull me to it look at your own chart
[02:53] so we have a small little pass above
[02:55] four thousand retraces back down in
[02:58] we'll look at the lower time frames in
[02:59] all of this
[03:01] price action now
[03:04] into the five minute candle
[03:08] this run here to here
[03:11] this price leg is part of this price
[03:14] like
[03:15] okay
[03:16] notice how this candle is high
[03:18] to this candle's low that range
[03:22] okay that range right there has one
[03:24] single pass
[03:25] whereas this one has one
[03:28] two
[03:29] notice that
[03:31] low high small door retracement and then
[03:34] a second level running
[03:38] because i had two stages to this
[03:40] delivery
[03:42] i want to use this most recent one
[03:44] and this is my dealing range
[03:46] the short-term low the short-term high
[03:49] i ran a fib on that and i showed this in
[03:51] the short little vignette i posted on my
[03:53] twitter
[03:54] by the way the twitter handle is i am
[03:58] the
[03:59] ict okay
[04:00] so it's at symbol
[04:02] capital i
[04:03] underscore
[04:05] a m
[04:06] underscore
[04:07] t-h-e underscore i-c-t
[04:10] okay it's a lot of people over there
[04:12] pretending to be me and maybe they're
[04:14] just
[04:15] you know
[04:17] i don't know if it's fanfare or what it
[04:19] is but uh some of them have been asking
[04:21] for money i'm not asking you for money
[04:23] and i'm never gonna ask you to dm me i'm
[04:24] never gonna dm you okay so if it ain't
[04:27] being posted publicly on twitter
[04:29] it isn't me
[04:31] all right so
[04:32] this dealing range here
[04:35] i measured
[04:36] the low to the high
[04:38] 50 is equilibrium i want to see it drop
[04:40] down into discount
[04:43] this small little area down here value
[04:45] gap we want to look at that on the lower
[04:47] time frame
[04:54] so from this run here to here i know
[04:56] some of you are going to ask some of
[04:57] them
[04:58] we're bringing it up today on twitter
[05:02] what about the times you said for the
[05:04] model
[05:05] um
[05:05] teaching you something that is
[05:08] outside the model as the reasons why
[05:10] you're not going to anticipate or see
[05:12] that typical setup that's the whole
[05:15] point of why i did it today plus i have
[05:16] a lot of personal things that take care
[05:18] of and administrative work
[05:20] in my private group so
[05:23] with that said
[05:25] the market rallies
[05:26] in here
[05:28] drops down in
[05:30] the fair value gap there
[05:33] once more above the 4000 level and then
[05:36] going into here's 8 30 by the way this
[05:37] is 8 30 candle
[05:40] and you can watch when it trades right
[05:41] into that very value got
[05:44] it rallies again
[05:46] it drops back down in
[05:48] and then at 9 30 this candle here
[05:50] explodes to the upside
[05:53] takes off and starts digging deeper into
[05:56] that
[05:57] alright so it
[05:59] traded up into
[06:00] almost the
[06:03] 4074 level looks like almost so
[06:07] we'll be looking for a continuation of
[06:08] the upside 4095.
[06:10] 4100 is next consideration
[06:14] i want to take you into the price action
[06:16] down in here and give you more details
[06:18] as to why i was willing to take
[06:19] something a little bit earlier today
[06:24] okay if you plot the
[06:26] nasdaq
[06:27] june contract for 2022 and on the
[06:30] compare chart on trading view if you go
[06:32] up into your trading
[06:35] view platform you'll see like a little
[06:36] plus symbol up here if you click on that
[06:39] it'll give you an opportunity to add
[06:41] another instrument
[06:43] and you add this symbol here nqm2022
[06:47] and then it'll plot a line chart but
[06:49] it's usually going to be applied on the
[06:50] close it's like a default
[06:52] you want to change that in the settings
[06:54] by just right clicking over here or
[06:56] highlight over top of it it'll give you
[06:58] like a little gear or something
[06:59] click on that and change the settings to
[07:01] and just change it to plotting on the
[07:03] low
[07:04] because you're comparing lows
[07:05] as you can see the nasdaq went lower
[07:07] here
[07:08] whereas the
[07:10] s p
[07:11] failed to go lower that's an smt
[07:13] divergence okay
[07:14] smt smart money technique it's
[07:16] accumulating
[07:18] in here whereas the
[07:20] nasdaq is taking liquidity out so
[07:22] there's a cracking correlation between
[07:23] the two usually they move in tandem
[07:27] but at certain times
[07:29] what times
[07:30] 8 30
[07:31] 9 30 at news events being released okay
[07:36] they'll create this divergence and if
[07:39] you have a bias
[07:40] it's helpful but if you don't know where
[07:42] it's going you're going to many times
[07:45] encounter what would look like smt
[07:46] divergence and then it disappears as
[07:48] they start moving in concert with one
[07:50] another so you have to be careful with
[07:51] that that's why i'm teaching that's why
[07:53] i always teach
[07:54] know what it's reaching for okay the
[07:56] bias has been bullish and for my
[07:58] framework for my setup because i gave
[07:59] you 4 000 and i had very little time to
[08:01] work with anything this morning
[08:03] i just hurried up and saw the chart i
[08:05] missed the actual ideal entry i just
[08:06] used a close proximity entry with an
[08:09] owner block
[08:10] and there you go so if you look at the
[08:14] relationship of that fair value gap
[08:16] dropping back down in higher low than
[08:18] that of e30
[08:21] versus the lower low made in nasdaq
[08:24] this is a stop out this is accumulation
[08:27] of longs this is going to be the
[08:29] telltale sign that it's going to go
[08:30] higher
[08:33] if you look at what we did on 830 it
[08:35] already snapped down into this gap
[08:38] and it's not likely to go lower than
[08:40] that there's no need to
[08:41] okay
[08:42] so
[08:44] it's being compressed
[08:47] basically like a spring or a
[08:50] like a
[08:52] more like a bomb really i hate to say it
[08:54] you know
[08:55] so
[08:57] crude but that's what it is it's like
[09:00] waiting
[09:01] and then all of a sudden it explodes
[09:03] it's waiting just below that daily
[09:06] bear shoulder block and it's digging up
[09:08] into that thing
[09:09] at range on that up close candle on the
[09:11] daily chart so it's climbing up up up up
[09:14] and we watch to see if it gets to the
[09:16] main threshold which is half of that
[09:18] fair shoulder block or up close can on
[09:20] the daily chart i was making rappers to
[09:21] be in the video
[09:25] all right so
[09:26] again we can see
[09:28] zoomed in
[09:31] price breaks back down into
[09:33] the fair vega after trading through the
[09:34] order block here this is a 15 minute
[09:36] time frame motor block by the way
[09:38] and then it rallies
[09:41] inside this little area in here
[09:43] there's one small little pull back into
[09:45] a fear making a one minute chart i'll
[09:46] leave that for you to go into and study
[09:52] and here is the hourly chart i want to
[09:53] kind of give you like a market structure
[09:55] perspective
[09:58] here's where it's likely to be drawn to
[09:59] next
[10:01] all of this movement down here we
[10:03] completely rebalanced all that here is
[10:06] the fair value gap i had drawn on the
[10:08] lower time frame chart just a moment ago
[10:09] before we move back up to an hour chart
[10:13] we have consolidated here ahead of
[10:16] running all the way up into this area
[10:18] here
[10:19] so notice what was happening we had to
[10:21] low
[10:23] retrace down into this low to high
[10:25] discount
[10:27] very value gap
[10:28] rallies
[10:30] dealing range low dealing range high
[10:32] retraces down into
[10:34] discount
[10:36] rallies
[10:37] dealing range low dealing range high
[10:40] discount fair value gap order block
[10:43] rally
[10:45] consolidate
[10:47] we rally come back down into the smaller
[10:49] time frame
[10:51] if you're vega
[10:53] snt diversions
[10:55] and rallies
[10:57] and keeps pressing higher heart higher
[10:59] so my question to you is how many of you
[11:02] first didn't listen to me when i said
[11:03] don't trade
[11:05] two
[11:06] did you try to sell short
[11:09] why
[11:10] the bias has been bullish
[11:13] it's likely to do what
[11:15] keep digging higher
[11:16] we try not to pick tops and look what
[11:19] this has done we've had a low a lower
[11:21] low a sudden dramatic
[11:24] low that we came back up had a shift in
[11:26] market structure here then we retreated
[11:29] back down to
[11:30] this imbalance
[11:32] so we're seeing the market do what keep
[11:33] going higher keep going higher picking
[11:35] up discount levels each time the
[11:37] algorithm is picking up more
[11:39] accumulated longs
[11:41] to press deeper into all of this range
[11:44] and likely trade into the buy side
[11:46] liquidity here
[11:48] so you have to know what you're looking
[11:50] for narrative
[11:51] and bias
[11:53] also what in this area or over here
[11:55] would constitute a short
[11:59] because we have all this range in here
[12:02] that it's not likely to go up to go
[12:03] straight all the way through all this
[12:05] stuff that's a
[12:07] high resistance liquidity run not that
[12:09] it can't happen but it's likely to not
[12:12] form
[12:13] or pan out because we had so many
[12:17] supporting
[12:18] ideas in here down closed candles are
[12:20] supporting price
[12:21] it's just finding
[12:23] underlying order flow that is bullish
[12:26] so it's likely to
[12:28] go up
[12:29] just to keep going higher not go up to
[12:31] go down
[12:32] because to go up to go down we have all
[12:34] of these ranges that we would have to
[12:35] pierce and break
[12:37] and that requires a lot of
[12:41] well
[12:42] intent
[12:43] not selling pressure okay and the intent
[12:46] is to send this thing higher on the
[12:47] daily chart which is why i took your
[12:48] attention to that initial gap on the
[12:51] daily chart so if you found this one
[12:53] insightful
[12:54] and hopefully you learned why today the
[12:56] range expansion took place
[12:58] why was it not as short we've been
[13:01] bullish we've been looking for prices to
[13:02] go higher and just for clarity let me go
[13:05] back up
[13:11] 4000 was my objective only because
[13:14] i mentioned 4000 during the commentaries
[13:17] this week so when i was talking to you
[13:19] in lectures i called this level so i
[13:21] wanted to give you a
[13:23] point of entry
[13:26] and then target hitting it
[13:28] and that was the whole point of me
[13:28] showing you a little vignette on
[13:31] twitter today
[13:32] showing you that i love what i was
[13:34] looking for how to frame a trade how to
[13:36] set it up and
[13:37] you engage it
[13:39] because it was setting up this trade
[13:41] here okay just for your notes
[13:44] because it gave nice run here earlier
[13:47] before seven o'clock in the morning
[13:49] that means we're probably going to have
[13:51] a deep retracement
[13:54] and
[13:56] look for an ideal scenario like we
[13:58] outlined with the smt divergence so
[14:01] smt
[14:02] usually will occur
[14:05] around a 9 30 time period
[14:07] when
[14:08] there has already been a nice early run
[14:10] before seven o'clock or at seven o'clock
[14:13] so we got real close to seven o'clock
[14:14] here but i'm not
[14:16] and i'm not limited
[14:18] to this model i know some of you were
[14:20] questioning you know with kind of like
[14:22] pointed remarks on uh twitter you know
[14:27] what are we doing here why are we not
[14:29] using the time frame that's used for the
[14:30] model
[14:31] i'm showing you again
[14:34] just proof that these things deliver
[14:37] as i teach them now i have not only
[14:40] taught what i've revealed on youtube i
[14:42] have lots of students i have students in
[14:43] my paid group
[14:44] i have
[14:46] casual people that come through and you
[14:47] know watch one video or two videos
[14:50] and i want them to see things
[14:52] that's being taught from
[14:55] my library of concepts
[14:56] so
[14:58] if i can see this setup early in the day
[15:01] before the seven o'clock in the morning
[15:05] to me it gives me
[15:07] insight it gives me
[15:08] an expectation around what
[15:11] the 9 30 opening is going to be like
[15:14] so if i get an early run like this
[15:16] my first thought is i need to go to smt
[15:19] later on at 9 30 because it's probably
[15:20] going to require
[15:22] some kind of a cracking correlation to
[15:23] set up the next lake if it's going to
[15:25] have one okay
[15:27] it's thursday tomorrow's friday we're
[15:29] going to go into a holiday weekend i
[15:31] will not be
[15:32] trading tomorrow i will not be trading
[15:33] on monday
[15:35] i'm going to be doing one video for my
[15:36] private group tomorrow and it's probably
[15:39] going to be an early video
[15:40] not so much a commentary for price
[15:42] action because
[15:45] you know it's a weekend and
[15:47] memorial day is on
[15:49] monday so the volume is probably going
[15:51] to be light on friday so
[15:53] if you're going to be trading
[15:55] you study in
[15:56] the morning session lead the afternoon
[15:58] to in the gamblers
[16:01] volume
[16:02] just probably won't be on your side in
[16:03] the afternoon everybody's going to be
[16:05] going away for a long weekend and don't
[16:08] trade on monday take the day off enjoy
[16:10] it have hot dogs hamburgers relax do
[16:12] what you got to do to be a family person
[16:15] i'm going to be doing the theme and
[16:16] until i talk to you lord willing next
[16:18] tuesday enjoy your weekend and your
[16:19] holiday be safe
