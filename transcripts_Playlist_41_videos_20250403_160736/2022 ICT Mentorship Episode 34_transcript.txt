[00:06] all right folks welcome back
[00:08] to all this
[00:11] showing off stuff
[00:13] all right so today we went through the
[00:15] process of
[00:17] watching and analyzing the opening
[00:21] price on es
[00:23] and i mentioned
[00:25] on twitter
[00:27] that i was interested in this old high
[00:29] back here
[00:31] that's
[00:32] largely linked to the fact that we had a
[00:35] gap when the session started again last
[00:37] night my local time about six o'clock
[00:39] and we got down
[00:41] and then it just drifted lower
[00:45] had a small little
[00:47] rally in here
[00:49] smt divergence i'll show you that in a
[00:51] moment but
[00:52] in here
[00:54] we have
[00:56] the market creating relative equal highs
[00:58] it broke down i gave you the
[01:00] fairway gap live this morning on the
[01:02] live stream walk you through the whole
[01:04] business of
[01:06] running out the cell side
[01:08] and the opening gap
[01:11] on sunday which is
[01:17] over here
[01:18] so i don't have that on my chart so let
[01:20] me just drop that on real quick
[01:25] if you don't mind me
[01:27] working as i go i don't want to be doing
[01:29] any more
[01:32] edits than
[01:34] i need to and i don't think you might be
[01:36] doing it in front of you so we can see
[01:37] what i'm showing you
[01:40] all right so the market trades down
[01:43] below the sell side here
[01:45] and
[01:46] into the sunday gap opening
[01:49] we traded through it
[01:51] all the way down to
[01:54] another
[01:56] favorite gap
[02:00] hits that there
[02:02] comes back up
[02:04] runs back up into the opening range
[02:07] drops once more into an older block
[02:10] rallies take the short term high
[02:13] retraces back down into another order
[02:15] block
[02:16] let me
[02:17] stretch this out as you can see a little
[02:19] bit better that's
[02:20] not as
[02:22] cluttered as it now
[02:26] all right and
[02:27] we worked
[02:28] off this order block
[02:30] this order block which you'll see when
[02:31] you get in the five minute chart it's a
[02:32] little bit cleaner
[02:34] here
[02:35] and here and rallying up into the level
[02:38] i was mentioning on twitter this morning
[02:40] so i'm gonna drop into a five minute
[02:43] chart
[02:48] [Music]
[02:50] okay and
[02:52] there's a favorite egg up i gave you
[02:53] live
[02:54] beautiful delivery look at the low
[02:57] on this candle right here
[02:59] right up here look at this value right
[03:01] here
[03:04] 39 26 and three quarters
[03:07] this candle trades right back up to what
[03:09] value the high now on this candle
[03:12] 39 26 and three quarters folks that is
[03:14] absolutely perfect that's perfect price
[03:18] delivery okay
[03:19] i know i'm kind of
[03:21] known for the forex market showing
[03:23] things like that to the pit that type of
[03:25] stuff
[03:26] it originated really with
[03:29] index futures bonds and index features
[03:32] so
[03:32] in the 90s i was
[03:34] utilizing these same tools i know it
[03:36] seems like it just came out of nowhere
[03:37] recently because i've talked about it
[03:40] but these things have been under my
[03:44] control my my ownership if you will
[03:48] for about three decades so
[03:51] it's nice to be able to share them
[03:53] obviously with all of you and it's
[03:55] very
[03:59] well i guess the word
[04:01] is
[04:04] fulfilling
[04:05] to
[04:06] show it to you
[04:07] to walk you through it live so you can
[04:09] see what it is what it looks like
[04:11] and
[04:12] yes i have a lot of people asking me why
[04:15] don't i give trade signals can i run a
[04:18] trade signal room please i will pay you
[04:21] can you do this and can you do that no
[04:23] i'm not going to do that okay
[04:26] i don't want to be in another
[04:29] paid
[04:30] service type thing okay i'm sick of it i
[04:33] don't want to deal with that no more i
[04:35] can make all the money i ever need
[04:37] trading and to be honest with you i
[04:39] don't really need to do anything anymore
[04:40] anyway i'm padded out
[04:43] so
[04:44] just enjoy the fact that i'm wanting to
[04:46] teach i love teaching i love sharing
[04:48] with you and i know it is helping a lot
[04:51] of you so just let that be the economy
[04:54] between us okay i like doing it you like
[04:56] receiving it it doesn't cost you
[04:57] anything so there you go
[05:00] so when we hit the sphere value gap
[05:03] it broke
[05:05] lower and then once more return back up
[05:07] into it
[05:08] well not into the fair value but up into
[05:10] that range
[05:11] here and then broke and i gave you a
[05:13] small little imbalance and we'll look at
[05:15] in a moment we traded down into the
[05:17] sunday gap i mentioned the lower end
[05:20] would be this time the level to watch
[05:22] and so if we went down below it come
[05:24] back up it'll act as what resistance
[05:27] it does so here we'll look at lower time
[05:28] frame drops lower
[05:31] once more hits the old fairway gap i
[05:33] showed you before we dropped into the
[05:35] five minute
[05:37] little bit of consolidation ahead of
[05:38] lunch
[05:40] typical retracement during the lunch
[05:42] hour all the way back up to the opening
[05:43] range
[05:46] broke lower
[05:47] small little swing low broken
[05:50] back to rebound and also look what it's
[05:52] doing here folks
[05:54] it's going back up into that old
[05:56] gap opening on sunday
[05:59] trades up into it access what resistance
[06:02] trades lower down into an order block
[06:06] big down handle right there that's the
[06:08] one
[06:08] over here
[06:10] hits it starts to accumulate
[06:12] rallies up
[06:14] back above
[06:15] what level
[06:17] here i'm gonna
[06:19] make sunday's levels really really
[06:22] obvious it's going to be obnoxious
[06:24] actually
[06:26] so i want you to see
[06:28] what was going on in my mind
[06:31] as i'm watching price
[06:34] okay
[06:36] price goes above
[06:38] the opening
[06:39] gap or gap opening rather from sunday
[06:42] then trades back down into it
[06:44] see that
[06:46] hits it rallies
[06:50] falls short of what
[06:53] the relative equal highs over here
[06:56] retraces where does it trade down into
[06:59] that gap opening again now we're at the
[07:01] discount low
[07:05] it rallies comes back down in fury value
[07:08] gap
[07:09] trades into that
[07:10] this is a 15 minute order block
[07:15] rallies and what's it go to
[07:22] the 39 52 and three quarters level
[07:25] hammers it beautiful
[07:27] beautiful beautiful beautiful in the
[07:29] afternoon it became a lot better in the
[07:32] morning it was sloppy so when i say
[07:34] things are sloppy
[07:36] it just means that
[07:37] it's not really giving you a whole lot
[07:39] to work with i mean you have very few
[07:41] options and you have to know exactly
[07:43] what you're looking for
[07:44] i.e what i was giving you this morning
[07:47] and this area here watch how it should
[07:50] stay open and it stayed open basically
[07:52] the whole thing this is sloppy even
[07:54] though it's a nice delivery
[07:57] it's not giving you all of the
[07:59] mechanics of entry like this one here
[08:02] this one here this one here and then run
[08:04] to the objective i was drawing your
[08:06] attention to today so the morning while
[08:08] yet
[08:09] it was still
[08:11] potentially profitable and i was able to
[08:13] call it for you live
[08:15] that really wasn't my
[08:16] choice
[08:18] session because it was just i didn't
[08:20] have a real clear view on what i wanted
[08:22] to see
[08:23] this morning one of the followers on my
[08:26] twitter feed
[08:28] uh a lady asked you know
[08:30] why was i talking about 39.53 level
[08:33] i rounded it up one
[08:36] quarter point
[08:37] above this level
[08:39] and the high comes in at
[08:41] 39.54 and a half so
[08:43] off by one and a half
[08:46] points so our handles
[08:48] so
[08:49] i was more interested in the run to that
[08:51] level versus just going down to the
[08:54] sunday gap opening or the old
[09:00] london open lows
[09:02] their trades there obviously and you can
[09:04] see i can see them coming it's not a
[09:06] matter of you know
[09:08] missing them because i don't know that
[09:09] they're there or forming
[09:12] my interest really lies with
[09:14] what is the setups that i'm liking the
[09:17] most like what is it i'm looking for
[09:19] specifically and the level i gave you
[09:21] that 3953 level i want to see a run up
[09:24] into that so we had to come down below
[09:26] and then back above sunday's gap opening
[09:29] and then it treats it as a dynamic
[09:31] support resistance level
[09:33] did you just hear ict that's blasphemy
[09:36] he just talked
[09:38] retail
[09:39] that's a cuss word around here
[09:42] well i'm talking about in a way where
[09:44] you'll understand it so the opening gap
[09:47] on sunday
[09:48] if you put it in your charts and just
[09:49] plot it across the entire week you'll
[09:51] see that many times there's a lot of
[09:53] valuation around that gap so it'll be
[09:56] treated as a dynamic price level if it's
[09:58] above it look for it to act as support
[10:00] if it's below it look for it to act as
[10:02] resistance and if you can find a swing
[10:04] high
[10:05] for instance
[10:06] we have these here we trade down
[10:09] okay if it's going to trade down into
[10:11] the sunday gap opening
[10:13] look for it to run about here there you
[10:15] go you don't need to have this level
[10:17] that i pointed out this is enough
[10:18] relative equal highs and relative equal
[10:20] highs over here so i've taught you how
[10:22] to find those bicep liquidity pools
[10:25] but i taught you today with this lesson
[10:28] using that sunday gap opening and just
[10:30] extending it through the entire week
[10:32] sometimes the week will just run away
[10:34] from it and won't really come back to it
[10:35] but in weeks where there's consolidation
[10:37] like fomc we have that
[10:39] uh to deal with for this calendar week
[10:41] and
[10:42] those types of events
[10:43] create these choppy range bound
[10:46] range bound
[10:47] markets that
[10:49] don't give you
[10:50] the real clean take off one-way
[10:52] directional move you have to know how to
[10:54] trade in these environments okay so
[10:56] obviously my tools do very well in this
[10:58] in this environment too but let's go
[11:00] down into
[11:03] four minute chart
[11:04] [Music]
[11:06] actually it's going to three
[11:13] and now let's go down to
[11:15] two minutes
[11:19] there it is i
[11:20] forgot what time frame i was looking at
[11:22] good grief
[11:23] all right so
[11:25] we dropped down to a lower timeframe
[11:26] here's the two minute you can see we
[11:28] have a fair value gap here i mentioned
[11:30] how i didn't want to see it come back up
[11:32] into that once we moved away go back and
[11:34] watch the live stream recording it's on
[11:35] youtube
[11:36] unedited it's exactly as it was done at
[11:39] the time you can see
[11:41] i was fumbling around
[11:43] had no idea what i'm doing
[11:44] um
[11:45] before i get in any further in this
[11:48] lesson and lecture
[11:50] understand this i am not
[11:53] buttering you all up
[11:54] to do these a lot
[11:57] i don't want to do them a lot they take
[11:59] a lot of my time they distract me from
[12:02] my own trading and my own personal life
[12:04] so i understand
[12:06] that doesn't
[12:07] you make you feel good because you had a
[12:09] good time today and maybe you learned
[12:11] something yesterday too
[12:13] but the other live session but
[12:16] i showed you what it looks like i showed
[12:18] you how you go into the marketplace and
[12:21] you read it
[12:22] and
[12:23] i'm gonna leave it up to you the viewers
[12:25] decide whether or not if these things
[12:27] work okay
[12:30] you don't need me holding your hand the
[12:32] worst thing that i could do
[12:33] is sit down with you just a few times a
[12:36] week or even once a week
[12:38] that would create such a co-dependency
[12:41] on me
[12:42] that it would not help you
[12:45] and to be quite honest with you
[12:48] i knew as soon as i did this
[12:50] i would get complaints and emails and
[12:52] things you know
[12:54] we need you to help us take live trades
[12:56] we want you to do that you're being
[12:58] selfish you're being ignorant you are
[13:01] you know
[13:03] self-centered because you won't tell us
[13:05] when to get in when to get down folks i
[13:07] didn't do this for that type of
[13:09] feedback okay
[13:11] i only promised i would show you that i
[13:12] could show you the things before it
[13:14] happens that way you can see what it
[13:16] looks like
[13:17] and there's nothing that's required
[13:19] you know to trick anybody i mean either
[13:21] it's going to work or it's not going to
[13:22] work but you have to be in front of the
[13:24] charts doing these types of things and
[13:26] failing is part of that that's how you
[13:28] learn these are opportunities to grow
[13:30] from that
[13:32] so anyway um
[13:36] i think that is
[13:38] it i want to go back up to the 15 minute
[13:40] time frame
[13:43] and talk a little bit about this area up
[13:45] here that gap i think that is
[13:48] where we're going to be
[13:49] drawing up into because this is in my
[13:51] opinion
[13:53] not going to be left open okay so
[13:56] they're going to want to trade back up
[13:57] into that there's missing data here
[13:59] okay there's an actual gap
[14:01] so it'll want to draw up into that
[14:04] and what to what price level
[14:06] i'd like to
[14:07] the low on that candle
[14:09] okay so if it was going to be a perfect
[14:11] delivery it would go right to that
[14:12] candle's low
[14:14] but i'm not expecting perfect i'm not
[14:16] suggesting that at all
[14:18] but
[14:18] if we go above this area that means
[14:22] we're probably going to go into a deeper
[14:23] run on the daily
[14:28] and
[14:29] [Music]
[14:34] let's take everything off here
[14:38] so we're likely to run this high here
[14:40] and we have another block there
[14:42] so the low at four thousand
[14:45] so that's something to consider and
[14:46] watch going forward
[14:48] for the rest of the week i may be wrong
[14:49] you know it's just something for you to
[14:51] go into your charts and start studying
[14:53] and looking for
[14:54] um i think i have one bit of business
[14:59] oh
[15:00] let's go back into
[15:05] let's go into a five-minute chart
[15:09] [Music]
[15:13] all right um i was watching hannah
[15:17] on her youtube channel
[15:18] and
[15:20] i don't know exactly
[15:23] of him what market was i want to say it
[15:24] was australian dollar maybe it was
[15:26] canadian dollar but something it was a
[15:27] 4x pair
[15:28] i don't need to have that
[15:30] on the chart to explain what i sell are
[15:31] doing and some of my students when they
[15:33] first come in to the fold they do this
[15:36] type of thing too
[15:37] they will look at a range like this like
[15:40] here
[15:41] to here and they'll measure that range
[15:44] low to high to find the 50 level and
[15:47] then use that over here
[15:50] for a discount that's not how we do it
[15:52] okay if we are looking for
[15:55] a
[15:56] short
[15:57] in anna's example she was looking for a
[15:59] short
[16:00] you want to look at the price leg that
[16:02] drops and this is going to be the
[16:03] reverse of that okay so this might be a
[16:04] little confusing but just reverse the
[16:06] logic and you'll understand i'm sure
[16:07] hannah will follow along
[16:09] so from the low here
[16:11] up to this high here
[16:13] if we're looking for a long to get above
[16:15] these relative equal highs and or use
[16:16] that 3953 level i was calling for or
[16:19] making reference to this morning
[16:22] this low up to this high this is what
[16:25] you'd be doing
[16:27] okay so if you're looking for it to go
[16:29] higher you're going to need to draw your
[16:31] fib from a low up to a high
[16:34] that dealing range from that low that a
[16:36] high we're waiting for in
[16:40] anticipated retracement
[16:42] so the retracements going down to and
[16:44] below 50 now this becomes what a
[16:47] discount so you can be hunting along at
[16:50] this level or less if we're into a fair
[16:52] value gap that's good
[16:54] okay
[16:54] uh the same thing is done here if we're
[16:56] looking because it has not taken this
[16:58] out here yet just fell short of it so if
[17:01] we take the fib and just anchor it to
[17:03] that high
[17:04] and run it to here
[17:07] you can see here's 50
[17:09] of this dealing range low this dealing
[17:10] range high
[17:11] and it drops down to a discount okay
[17:14] you're looking at
[17:16] expansion swings
[17:18] okay or impulsive price swings in the
[17:21] direction you're trying to trade you
[17:23] don't want to use
[17:24] a
[17:25] price leg from high to low
[17:27] measuring something that you're trying
[17:29] to go
[17:30] long one
[17:31] but you don't want that you want to be
[17:33] using the impulsive price swings that go
[17:36] in the direction you're trading then it
[17:38] retraces down in below 50 or add it into
[17:40] a fair value gap
[17:42] then you can
[17:44] probe that as a long
[17:45] and rallies up
[17:47] so i just want to kind of clarify that i
[17:49] wasn't sure if she was
[17:50] aware of what she was doing but if she
[17:53] wasn't aware that now she knows
[17:56] so that way all of you have had the
[17:57] benefit of learning
[17:59] through her interactive study which i'm
[18:01] absolutely
[18:02] loving i'm loving it um
[18:05] i wish more of you would do it
[18:07] and as long as i had time to
[18:10] to
[18:10] sit down usually it's on the weekends
[18:12] that i get a chance to catch up to stuff
[18:13] like that but
[18:15] i'm loving the thailand
[18:17] vibe i'm loving the
[18:19] you know the booboo kits and
[18:21] not so much
[18:22] the food poisoning
[18:24] sorry for that but
[18:26] hopefully this has been insightful to
[18:28] you hannah hopefully everyone else has
[18:29] got something from this as well and i'm
[18:31] sure i'll be back again lord willing on
[18:33] thursday until then be safe
