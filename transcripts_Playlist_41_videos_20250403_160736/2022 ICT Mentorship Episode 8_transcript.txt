[00:05] all right folks welcome back
[00:07] this is episode
[00:08] number eight
[00:11] applying institutional order flow to
[00:13] forex markets
[00:15] all right folks welcome back
[00:17] taking a look at trading view and i
[00:20] promise this is going to be a really
[00:21] short one tonight
[00:23] um
[00:25] let's go to euro
[00:34] and whenever i'm looking at data from
[00:36] trading view this is the
[00:38] data feed i use for
[00:40] forex pairs only forex.com i don't want
[00:44] definitely not them
[00:49] all right so we have the daily chart up
[00:52] for euro yen
[00:56] just so you know i hate the end pairs i
[00:59] can't stand them
[01:00] but
[01:01] but for the sake of completeness
[01:03] this is how you would
[01:05] look for these types of patterns in
[01:07] forex
[01:09] now i have lots of feedback in the
[01:11] comments section that
[01:13] you don't get to see but it's really
[01:14] just for me i get a lot of requests
[01:16] whether or not this is
[01:18] appropriate to be using for higher time
[01:20] frame charts and i think daily charts
[01:22] are
[01:22] what everyone classifies a higher higher
[01:25] time frame chart so
[01:26] i want you to take a look at shark fry
[01:28] do any mock up on it
[01:34] pause the video if you're not ready
[01:40] still don't pause it to you
[01:42] all right take a look at the
[01:45] relative equal lows over you see that
[01:48] it's gonna go
[01:50] quick and dirty tonight
[01:52] right and dirty
[01:54] all right so we have
[01:56] relative equal lows
[01:58] marked out over here the market has
[01:59] traded down through
[02:02] and created a run higher
[02:05] now here is why i do not like the end
[02:08] pairs okay i get questions all the time
[02:10] why don't you like again pairs icd they
[02:12] move around nice they do this they do
[02:14] that
[02:15] they tend to have like a double
[02:18] return to a specific level i like to see
[02:20] and you're going to see it right here
[02:22] okay
[02:23] swing high
[02:25] the market rallies through that
[02:27] there's no
[02:28] fair value out there
[02:30] it drops back down in
[02:32] then it runs again taking out this
[02:35] swing high so we have two
[02:38] points of market structure that have
[02:40] moved to the upside in order its price
[02:42] is traded above it
[02:44] now this leg here
[02:47] you want to go back through that
[02:48] and see is there a fair value gap
[02:52] well we have one
[02:54] and two
[02:56] market trades down into it here
[03:01] sends it higher
[03:03] what's above here buy side liquidity
[03:06] this old high back here could be a draw
[03:08] on liquidity as well so there's gonna be
[03:09] buy stops whether it trades there or not
[03:11] it's irrelevant okay
[03:14] it's likely to draw to it
[03:16] just like you know
[03:18] playing horseshoes you play the game
[03:20] horseshoes
[03:21] not every single time you throw a
[03:23] horseshoe is it going to go on that post
[03:26] but it's still fun to play right so
[03:28] you're aiming at that post whether you
[03:30] hit that post or not and this would be
[03:31] like the post in the game
[03:33] playing horseshoes you're just aiming
[03:35] for it
[03:36] now obviously we started trading a new
[03:37] day here but this candle which was the
[03:40] 10th of february 2022
[03:42] this daily candle
[03:45] we could trust that this was likely to
[03:47] go higher because we went up we've
[03:49] consolidated
[03:51] and then start another run into this
[03:54] high here
[03:55] again whether it trades through it or
[03:56] not it's irrelevant okay because even a
[03:58] failure swing to get above old highs if
[04:00] there's enough range from being right
[04:02] here at the open to reaching up to here
[04:04] that's enough to take a stab at it and
[04:06] see if you're going to get any kind of
[04:07] yield
[04:09] so that's an example of it occurring on
[04:12] a daily chart but i want to go into this
[04:13] very day right there okay the 10th
[04:17] so we're going to drop down into a 15
[04:19] minute time frame
[04:22] all right here's a 15 minute time frame
[04:23] and
[04:24] we're going to mark up our chart
[04:32] midnight new york time
[04:35] rocket rallies in here
[04:39] yeah
[04:41] and then we go into the
[04:42] new york session right here
[04:44] so we're going to go into this
[04:47] price structure
[04:49] and fair it out
[04:51] the run that occurred in here
[04:53] so i'm going to
[04:55] put a rectangle in this area so that way
[04:56] we know what we're looking at relative
[04:58] to this 15 minute time frame
[05:07] you guys ask why i do powerpoint slides
[05:09] this is the reason why
[05:11] it makes it a lot easier to go right to
[05:12] what i'm looking for
[05:14] all right we're gonna drop down to a
[05:15] five minute chart
[05:19] okay
[05:20] and if you take a look at
[05:34] seven o'clock in the morning
[05:38] 10 o'clock in the morning
[05:40] that's your new york
[05:41] ict killzone okay that's the time of day
[05:44] that new york session trades form
[05:48] i have more information in that regard
[05:50] for
[05:51] time of day
[05:52] for forex in this
[05:54] channel i said lots of videos lots of
[05:56] topics and things you can explore i
[05:58] don't want to beat it to death because
[05:59] i've already done in other places but
[06:01] just know that seven o'clock in the
[06:02] morning 10 o'clock in the morning new
[06:03] york time again
[06:04] on trading view you need to have it
[06:06] toggled to that everything else
[06:09] it'll be wrong
[06:11] all right so here is the time of day at
[06:13] the forming of a new york setup
[06:18] forms all right so we have the market
[06:21] trading down
[06:24] takes out a swing low trades down below
[06:26] that
[06:27] and then punches higher
[06:29] right above this swing high
[06:31] inside this price like right here is
[06:34] there a fair value gap we're going to
[06:36] start breaking it down top down from
[06:38] five minute
[06:40] top down
[06:41] we're gonna break it down from the five
[06:43] minute down to the one minute chart so
[06:46] from this low
[06:48] up to this high
[06:54] right in there that's we're gonna
[06:57] study on each new time frame so i'll go
[07:00] down to three minutes
[07:06] okay so in this price leg here do we
[07:08] take out a swing low yes we trade down
[07:12] below swing low
[07:13] does it take out a swing high
[07:17] here
[07:18] yes it does so now we have a valid
[07:20] condition to see if there's a trade
[07:23] go back through this price leg
[07:25] is there a fair value got
[07:28] right in here
[07:31] and this one here
[07:32] so remember i was teaching you it could
[07:34] stab down there just be mindful of that
[07:36] but
[07:37] try to get your entry in on that one
[07:39] there
[07:41] and that's what we have here trace that
[07:43] to it there
[07:44] now the question is going to be is how
[07:46] far
[07:47] will it trade to because we're not
[07:49] looking at anything over here because a
[07:51] middle of the range type idea so for
[07:53] expansion type moves practical lesson
[07:56] tonight where if we don't have a range
[07:58] to trade inside of
[08:00] how do we anticipate how far can trade
[08:01] up or trade down in this case we're
[08:03] looking for a long
[08:05] where would our targets be because the
[08:06] old high is over here
[08:08] now i'm sure if we went to a hard time
[08:10] frame keep looking to the left we'll
[08:11] find something
[08:12] but a real easy way
[08:15] is to take
[08:17] your price
[08:20] leg over here see this swing low break
[08:22] prior to this run up then we
[08:24] consolidated drop down create a discount
[08:27] and then create our retracement rally
[08:32] and start to run up into these highs
[08:34] how can we know
[08:37] well i like to take a fib
[08:45] anchor it
[08:46] let go of my
[08:48] and anchor it to
[08:50] a previous swing okay so from this low
[08:53] that is high
[08:54] after we leave this consolidation it
[08:56] starts to trade higher
[08:59] um standard deviation negative one
[09:02] and i got a lot of questions you know
[09:04] what's my setup for my fib i actually
[09:06] show that on the ote primer video so
[09:09] you're welcome to take a look at that on
[09:11] the youtube channel as well
[09:13] 133.153
[09:19] and
[09:24] that's not that
[09:25] let's see
[09:27] hi is 133
[09:29] 15 and three so right to the right to
[09:32] the point that you'd be looking for
[09:34] and then
[09:37] we've seen it received from that
[09:41] okay
[09:43] so
[09:44] obviously when i show example like this
[09:46] makes me want to trade me in
[09:49] but i hate this pair i can't stand
[09:51] there's other markets that
[09:53] can scratch my itch for 4x but this one
[09:55] is not one i like to trade
[09:56] but
[09:57] i wanted to come out tonight and kind of
[09:59] give you
[10:00] a quick view of what you could do with
[10:02] these
[10:03] markets using the model okay
[10:06] there is a approach that you can use
[10:08] with the london session okay and london
[10:11] would be marking up your vertical lines
[10:13] relative to new york local time two
[10:16] o'clock in the morning to five a.m so
[10:18] you'd have your your bracket so your
[10:20] operating hours would be hunting the
[10:22] setup
[10:23] for new york between seven o'clock in
[10:24] the morning and ten o'clock
[10:26] local new york time
[10:28] for london session trades
[10:30] you would look for setups that would
[10:34] provide you a way to trade a fair value
[10:36] gap between two o'clock in the morning
[10:37] and five o'clock in the morning okay and
[10:41] that's as easy as i can make it for you
[10:43] it's simple and any additional
[10:44] information you would want to have i
[10:47] have absolutely covered it in other
[10:49] videos in this youtube channel okay so
[10:51] it's predominantly a forex channel and
[10:54] it's only been recently with the 2022
[10:56] mentorship i'm talking and teaching
[10:57] about the stock indices so
[11:00] i got a lot of requests for 4x so here
[11:02] you go it's
[11:04] simply applying what you've been trained
[11:07] with the futures indices
[11:10] but
[11:11] just applying it to the forex market but
[11:13] applying it to the time of day relative
[11:14] to
[11:16] new york
[11:17] or london and yes you can take trades in
[11:19] asia yes you can take trades in london
[11:21] close
[11:23] but i'd prefer to have you just trade on
[11:25] these two time frames here or time of
[11:27] day rather
[11:28] being new york open which is what's
[11:30] being shown here seven o'clock tomorrow
[11:31] ten o'clock in the morning new york
[11:32] local time again always i can't say it
[11:34] enough because if you don't do this
[11:36] and you just have it set to your local
[11:38] time
[11:39] it won't work
[11:40] but it's new york local time on trading
[11:42] view
[11:43] seven o'clock to ten o'clock this is the
[11:46] time when you're hunting the setup okay
[11:48] so
[11:49] in summary
[11:51] we can anticipate this market going
[11:52] higher why because the euro dollar is
[11:55] going higher
[11:56] you can also
[11:58] check it by going to let's go to daily
[12:01] chart
[12:02] first
[12:10] and you can go to
[12:12] 6e which is euro futures
[12:15] and let us use the front month
[12:16] continuous
[12:18] okay you can see how euro
[12:21] where has it been going
[12:23] so has it been going lower or higher
[12:26] clearly going higher
[12:28] what has
[12:30] the yen been doing
[12:37] so when you look at forex pairs you want
[12:39] to look for that relationship between
[12:41] the
[12:42] instruments that make up your pair
[12:44] so euro yen euro is strong yen is weak
[12:49] so what would that mean for euro yen it
[12:51] would mean that
[12:52] if your bias is bullish
[12:55] and you have this
[12:57] underpinning
[12:58] between euro and yen
[13:00] it's going to make this pair go higher
[13:03] it's a real simple way of looking at how
[13:06] to determine
[13:07] these exotic crosses okay and how to
[13:09] frame the logic behind whether it should
[13:11] go higher or lower
[13:13] and then apply time today wait for the
[13:15] pattern i'm teaching you
[13:16] and you won't need to do anything else
[13:18] you don't need to buy a subscription to
[13:19] anybody's services you don't need to
[13:22] learn anything else you don't have to
[13:23] buy any courses it's all right here for
[13:25] free and
[13:27] it works
[13:28] until i talk to you next week enjoy
[13:30] weekend and be safe
