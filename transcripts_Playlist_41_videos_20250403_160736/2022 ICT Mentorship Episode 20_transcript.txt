[00:05] all right folks welcome back
[00:07] it feels just like yesterday last time
[00:09] we'd smoke
[00:12] all right so here we have one of those
[00:14] instances where as luck would have it
[00:19] the hands of fate the planets aligned
[00:22] all those factors came in on something i
[00:25] gave you an analysis
[00:26] last night
[00:28] now
[00:29] before you
[00:30] start snickering and rolling your eyes
[00:33] and sending your husband up to slap me
[00:34] on stage
[00:36] just understand that this is just
[00:38] one
[00:39] piece
[00:40] one little piece
[00:43] of price action
[00:44] in the delivery that the algorithm will
[00:48] likely not every single instance but it
[00:50] will likely repeat
[00:52] okay it's the logic that i've shared on
[00:54] this youtube channel
[00:55] and
[00:56] i've been asked obviously if you read
[00:58] the comments in the videos
[01:00] can i show an example of this
[01:02] working in london session for forex
[01:06] no problem
[01:07] to do that i set the stage with the
[01:10] analysis last night there are folks out
[01:12] there that will say i don't know how to
[01:14] pick the tops and the bottoms or the
[01:16] highs and the lows of the day they don't
[01:18] know
[01:18] what i'm teaching so it's easy for them
[01:21] to say those types of things and a new
[01:23] student
[01:24] may
[01:25] stumble upon their comment may stumble
[01:26] upon their youtube channel and whatever
[01:28] their medium is
[01:30] they follow that logic without
[01:32] investigating it or looking into whether
[01:35] or not these things that i claim are
[01:37] true
[01:37] so
[01:39] without a safety net last night i
[01:41] outlined it for you i explained what it
[01:43] should do why it should take place
[01:46] and therefore
[01:47] we watch
[01:48] and do i see
[01:51] in my chart like you should see in yours
[01:54] what i outlined
[01:56] not exactly to the level i was outlining
[01:59] but the general premise was there what i
[02:01] mean by that
[02:03] well we were in this area here
[02:05] and i mentioned that i felt that it was
[02:07] going to go below the 100 level
[02:10] and if i were making the market in other
[02:12] words if i was the market maker
[02:15] providing the
[02:16] parameters at which the dollar index
[02:19] will go down to set up a buying
[02:21] opportunity
[02:22] i would take it down to the 99 uh
[02:25] 99.92 level
[02:27] okay
[02:28] and you can check me on that with the
[02:30] video i uploaded and i can't edit a
[02:33] video on youtube once it's there it's
[02:36] there
[02:37] okay so i know some of you are actually
[02:38] downloading them let's that's fine but
[02:41] go to episode 19 which is the one i just
[02:43] did last night
[02:45] and listen to the 20 minute mark around
[02:47] 10 second
[02:49] in that vicinity and let it play for a
[02:50] minute or so and you'll hear me outline
[02:53] the very thing that you're seeing in
[02:55] your chart right now
[02:56] so
[02:58] the question is going to be how do i
[03:00] know
[03:01] to call that level in
[03:04] why did i know that it was likely to set
[03:06] up a london setup
[03:08] well i'm going to teach that to you
[03:09] tonight
[03:10] so
[03:11] understand this is not the model for my
[03:13] daughter this is not
[03:16] an addition to the model i'm just simply
[03:19] answering questions because i got a lot
[03:21] of them
[03:22] and
[03:22] i'm not trying to push this inside of
[03:25] the model for
[03:28] this youtube mentorship because the next
[03:30] step is going to be can you go into
[03:32] london and do live sessions so we can
[03:34] copy what you're doing i'm not going to
[03:36] do that okay now some of you are going
[03:37] to be upset say oh well see you're not
[03:39] proving anything well if you're not
[03:41] seeing this as proof
[03:43] move along okay just move along i'm only
[03:46] going to do what i'm willing to do okay
[03:48] and i'm having fun showing what i'm
[03:49] showing and it's really enough
[03:52] only those individuals that want to be
[03:54] spoon fed set ups and trades and
[03:56] piggyback my ideas they're the only ones
[03:58] that really push and twist my arm and
[04:00] they're going to be frustrated so i'm
[04:02] just letting you know
[04:04] that's not going to happen so don't ask
[04:06] i don't care how many times you
[04:08] present it nicely
[04:09] in a comment or request it's simply not
[04:11] going to happen
[04:13] it's important for you to go in and find
[04:15] these setups on your own using what i'm
[04:17] teaching
[04:18] so i mentioned that we would drop below
[04:19] that 100 level
[04:22] why did i pick the 99.92 level
[04:25] okay well
[04:27] if you look at the price action
[04:30] right over here
[04:32] okay we had this run up
[04:35] at the beginning of that candle right
[04:36] there
[04:38] just draw that out in time
[04:40] i gave you about
[04:41] 99.95 99.92
[04:45] level
[04:46] okay a small little range of about three
[04:48] pips
[04:49] that's what i was eyeballing last night
[04:51] now i was talking to you obviously
[04:52] before midnight
[04:54] now there's things that i teach and have
[04:56] in my repertoire that helps me fine-tune
[04:59] the low of the day you know i'm not
[05:00] going to teach that here and then
[05:02] because i have a community obviously i'm
[05:03] obligated to i'm not obligated here okay
[05:06] so i don't want to be thinking you can
[05:08] guilt me into doing more than i'm
[05:09] already willing to do
[05:11] but just know that there's things that i
[05:13] didn't
[05:14] basically use at my repertoire at
[05:16] midnight that will help me fine tune the
[05:18] actual low within about
[05:21] two to three pips
[05:23] sometimes right on the very low but it's
[05:25] not needed okay
[05:27] the idea that i just gave on the fly
[05:30] last night when i was doing the
[05:31] commentary was really simply just rooted
[05:34] on the idea of this extension
[05:37] and ending it right on that candle's
[05:39] high and just eyeballing it so
[05:41] that's what i was looking at
[05:43] i expected it to drop down
[05:46] i'm not
[05:48] convinced that we're going to see this
[05:50] top yet
[05:51] so i felt that it dropped down here
[05:54] and also
[05:55] being a setup going into london that's
[05:57] what i would expect and i'm going to
[05:58] teach you how to use that information if
[06:01] that's what you want to investigate and
[06:02] study on your own
[06:04] but notice that we ran up above these
[06:05] relative vehicle highs and
[06:07] that's what we ran for the intraday
[06:10] price action target so the height of the
[06:12] day that was set initially around the
[06:13] midnight time frame it dropped down
[06:15] creating the entire run lower
[06:18] creating the london low real close to
[06:20] where i was outlining it not exactly
[06:22] obviously but it's good enough for
[06:23] government work and the market starts to
[06:26] rally and it takes out the initial high
[06:27] of the day
[06:28] but more specifically it aims for these
[06:30] really clean levels you have this high
[06:32] here here and here remember i was
[06:34] teaching
[06:36] just like this level here the market
[06:38] does not like to leave that
[06:40] that is not efficient
[06:42] now it's efficient for technical
[06:44] analysis
[06:45] retail 101 where they'll see that as
[06:48] resistance it looks perfect that's what
[06:50] they want because the books teach that
[06:53] the books are meant
[06:55] to trip you up
[06:57] it's flawed logic folks i mean i hate to
[06:59] say this type of thing to
[07:03] certain individuals because they they
[07:04] take aim at me like i'm trying to
[07:06] belittle everyone else it's not that i'm
[07:08] trying to belittle anyone else i'm
[07:10] trying to
[07:11] shake you by the lapels and simply say
[07:13] look
[07:14] listen to what i'm saying don't believe
[07:16] what i'm saying investigate the things
[07:18] i'm stating in the video so that way you
[07:20] can come to your own conclusion either
[07:22] i'm
[07:23] making things up
[07:25] or there's really logic behind it and
[07:27] you can dismiss 99.9 of the things out
[07:30] there that everyone looks and relies on
[07:34] having your charts as far as analysis
[07:36] concepts or indicators you don't need
[07:37] all that stuff
[07:39] so if i'm suggesting as i mentioned last
[07:41] night in the
[07:42] video that we would drop down here and
[07:45] then start to go higher
[07:46] that sets the stage for what
[07:49] if this is going to be a point at which
[07:51] it reacts and goes higher
[07:53] as i was outlining around this time
[07:55] period in the video
[07:57] that means the opposite should be seen
[08:00] for euro
[08:02] but before we get into that let's fine
[08:04] tune this a little bit more on the 15
[08:05] minute time frame you can see we drop
[08:07] down creating the low of the day in
[08:09] london open that's our kill zone that i
[08:11] teach here on the youtube channel it's
[08:13] two o'clock in the morning to five
[08:14] o'clock in the morning
[08:15] new york local time
[08:17] so if you are
[08:19] using the
[08:20] time window thing over here
[08:22] set it to
[08:23] local new york
[08:25] two o'clock at five o'clock in the
[08:27] morning that's the kill zone for london
[08:28] open market comes down creates the low
[08:30] of the day
[08:31] runs back up back into an order block
[08:33] here
[08:35] i'll let you look at the lower timing
[08:36] frames and you'll see
[08:39] that is in fact an order block
[08:41] and optimal trade entry and the market
[08:43] starts to create its run up into the
[08:44] relative equal highs
[08:46] sweeping that
[08:47] as a daily objective
[08:50] now if this is the low of the day and if
[08:53] it's
[08:54] what i've outlined in advance and you
[08:56] see that last night beforehand
[08:59] this is what i expected to see price
[09:00] drop down in and then start to go higher
[09:06] at the same time euro runs all the way
[09:09] back up to the previous week's high
[09:13] how is this likely to be a false
[09:15] breakout
[09:16] we have to use inter-market
[09:18] relationships like i'm showing you with
[09:19] dollar index so if you're trading 4x
[09:21] it's important to relate your analysis
[09:24] in the trading
[09:25] market okay for instance if you're
[09:27] looking at euro that's your trading
[09:29] market
[09:30] you have to have a barometer something
[09:31] to measure its
[09:33] movement with
[09:34] and that's market relationships so
[09:38] having that with the dollar
[09:40] dollar coming down to a level outline
[09:42] last night that it would be a bullish
[09:44] area it'd be a sensitive price point to
[09:46] see in advance higher
[09:49] because it's relationship with euro it's
[09:52] inverted so if dollar is going
[09:54] down to that level
[09:57] that level being 99.92
[10:00] then it's not a
[10:02] surprise to see euro rally higher as
[10:04] it's doing that
[10:06] but what is the euro reaching for
[10:09] this high and it went so far as to go up
[10:11] above
[10:12] the previous week's high so they really
[10:14] reached up in there took out the
[10:16] previous week's high
[10:17] and at that same instance right there
[10:20] that's when dollar hit the objective i
[10:23] told you last night
[10:25] that would be a buying opportunity for a
[10:26] dollar
[10:27] if it's a buying opportunity for a
[10:29] dollar then it's a shorting opportunity
[10:30] at that very moment
[10:33] look at your own charts and study
[10:35] the moment it hits
[10:37] this level here it's the same moment
[10:39] that the dollar index is hitting
[10:41] that area i was outlining last night for
[10:44] a buying opportunity for a dollar
[10:46] so this is a false breakout because my
[10:50] analysis was done and shared with you
[10:52] openly that that would be a buying
[10:54] opportunity for a dollar
[10:55] setting the stage for what as i outlined
[10:58] i'm bearish foreign currency
[11:01] could i have bought that sure
[11:03] because i'm expecting the dollar index
[11:04] to drop down to that 99.92 did i no
[11:08] i went to sleep
[11:09] i was tired so
[11:12] i'm not concerned about that i didn't
[11:13] take the short either i don't care i
[11:15] don't want to be in every single move
[11:17] and i'm not trying to trade forex right
[11:18] now
[11:19] but
[11:20] to prove to you folks that are sitting
[11:22] out there asking to see if it can be
[11:23] done in london does the concepts work
[11:26] can i call a move can i give an idea can
[11:29] i do these things before it happens yes
[11:32] but simply because i can doesn't
[11:34] obligate me to okay i'm not here trying
[11:37] to perform magic tricks for you okay i'm
[11:39] not i'm not trying to do that i'm trying
[11:42] to teach you to trust your own analysis
[11:43] and lean on your own experience even in
[11:46] the early stages when there isn't that
[11:48] much of it
[11:49] it's okay you learn to grow
[11:52] gradually
[11:56] all right so the 15 minute time frame
[11:58] you can see that the euro went up into
[12:00] its kill zone here two o'clock in the
[12:01] morning five o'clock morning new york
[12:02] local time
[12:04] so
[12:06] it creates the high of the day so in
[12:08] this price run we're to start stripping
[12:10] it down i'm going to make it very easy
[12:11] and not make this video very long but
[12:13] i'm going to jump right to
[12:14] a
[12:16] very small time frame chart
[12:21] 2 minute
[12:23] has the very clean
[12:25] fair value gap so after it ran above
[12:27] that old weekly high
[12:30] the market trades lower and takes out
[12:32] that short term low now some of you
[12:34] might see this short term low and say
[12:35] well why didn't you use that low
[12:37] instead of this one here
[12:39] well the reason why is the fair value
[12:40] gap forms right here on this candle once
[12:42] that candle closes the very next candle
[12:45] it opens essentially right at that low
[12:47] so it hasn't really moved away and
[12:49] hasn't really shown me what displacement
[12:52] something energetic where it moves away
[12:54] from that fair value gap that's the
[12:56] important factor
[12:57] so we have the parabolic gap here
[13:00] and then it moves lower than that short
[13:02] term low now we have a shift in market
[13:04] structure the market could have came
[13:06] back up into this run here and offered
[13:08] an entry there but it didn't notice that
[13:10] it went a little bit lower that's fine
[13:12] and then rallies up to that level here
[13:15] this is the entry point
[13:17] now
[13:18] think about where your stop loss would
[13:19] be and think about where your entry
[13:20] would be based on what i taught you
[13:22] using new york session
[13:26] this is an opportunity to pause the
[13:27] video and think about the frustrated
[13:28] annotations
[13:35] you're smirking aren't you thinking i'm
[13:36] not positive so you just might as well
[13:38] get on with it ict
[13:41] okay so here we have a zoomed in
[13:44] two minute chart
[13:46] and here is the fair value gap level
[13:48] that you would be putting your limit
[13:49] order in
[13:50] so it gets filled essentially right
[13:52] there
[13:53] remember it's not going to be placed in
[13:55] the marketplace
[13:56] for a shorting opportunity or entry on
[13:58] limit
[13:59] anytime in here because it has to move
[14:01] away from the fear of a gap
[14:04] so it doesn't on this candle here so we
[14:06] have that
[14:07] run through
[14:08] this short term low we have displacement
[14:11] it was energetic move lower away from
[14:13] the fair value gap
[14:15] it doesn't get to it here it goes a
[14:16] little bit deeper we wait we don't chase
[14:19] it we don't go in here thinking oh well
[14:20] i missed the move
[14:21] we still have time see all this over
[14:23] here the kill zone for london open is
[14:25] still open
[14:27] so we allow for that retracement higher
[14:30] your fill
[14:31] here
[14:32] maybe one pipette maybe a half a pip or
[14:34] maybe a full pip above this candle's
[14:36] high
[14:37] that would be your entry but we're just
[14:39] going to use the actual candle high
[14:40] that would be your limit order entry
[14:42] hypothetically 1.0924 and four pipettes
[14:46] that's your entry
[14:49] your stop also be above the high here
[14:51] that comes in at 1.0936 and a half
[14:55] and the heat or the drawdown that you
[14:57] absorb hypothetically if you would use
[15:00] that entry point
[15:02] is 1.09301
[15:05] so basically
[15:07] not even five pips
[15:10] okay so
[15:11] well about five pips around about five
[15:13] pips of
[15:14] drawdown so essentially 25 we'll call it
[15:17] the 30 so call five pips there it is
[15:18] done
[15:19] so five pips to draw down
[15:21] and never came to your spot
[15:25] with this gearing
[15:27] okay
[15:28] if you use sound money management
[15:30] how much can you risk if you're risking
[15:32] you know a thousand dollars per trade
[15:35] okay you're thinking about money-wise
[15:37] don't do that you think about it in
[15:39] terms of fixed
[15:41] percentage risk own equity so that means
[15:43] you're simply going to look at how much
[15:45] money you have in the account
[15:47] take that times that by one percent
[15:50] okay one percent is the maximum
[15:52] preferably you should be doing a half a
[15:53] one percent or maybe a quarter of one
[15:55] percent
[15:56] you're learning you're not trying to do
[15:57] a lot in the beginning you're trying to
[15:59] just simply trust the idea of seeing
[16:01] these moves
[16:03] none of you should be going into demo
[16:04] none of you would have done this
[16:06] obviously because we're talking about in
[16:07] hindsight but i'm showing you the
[16:09] relationships of how when the market
[16:12] went to this level here and cleared the
[16:13] buy stops on the previous high on euro
[16:15] that's the very moment
[16:17] that the dollar index went down to the
[16:18] level outline it would be bullish so the
[16:22] teeter-totter effect or the inverse
[16:23] relationships that if the dollar is
[16:26] going to go higher that means that it's
[16:27] going to have weight
[16:29] introduced to euro and it should start
[16:31] to go lower
[16:32] so your entry here and your drawdown and
[16:35] your stop
[16:37] all those being what they are here
[16:39] if we go out a little bit further and
[16:41] i'm just using a five minute chart so i
[16:42] can put everything in
[16:44] the fractal in other words the fractals
[16:46] just move up and then down
[16:48] that way you can see it all and have the
[16:50] candles still be clean and have
[16:52] everything on one chart so that's the
[16:53] only reason why i'm showing the five
[16:55] minute chart it's not that i'm doing
[16:56] anything special with it okay it's just
[16:58] to show you the overall dynamic of this
[17:00] price run up
[17:01] the rejection
[17:03] the optimal trade entry that would be
[17:05] used with the fair value got used on the
[17:08] two minute time frame
[17:09] all the levels and things here being as
[17:12] they were on the two-minute chart
[17:14] and if you did a fibonacci
[17:16] run from the the low here by this one
[17:18] because it was the most energetic
[17:20] starting this price right here
[17:22] that would be your parent price leg 50
[17:24] is around in here so that would be a
[17:27] nice objective initially that would be
[17:28] your first target if you're going to
[17:29] hold for the full day it could go down
[17:33] to this area here and lo and behold
[17:35] we have that imbalance it trades right
[17:37] into that rather handsomely
[17:39] so
[17:40] there's your example using it i gave you
[17:42] the framework beforehand i told you what
[17:44] to expect in the dollar index and
[17:45] everybody should know that the euro is
[17:46] going to be the opposite direction of
[17:48] whatever the dollar is going to do
[17:49] so hopefully this has been insightful to
[17:51] you and you got something out of it
[17:52] until i'll talk to you next time next
[17:53] week next tuesday actually
[17:55] lord willing
[17:57] enjoy weekend and be safe
