We are going to build a YouTube transcriber to then generate notes with timestamps. We are going to use this github repo https://github.com/jdepoix/youtube-transcript-api/tree/master.
We are going to get the transcript using this repo and we will pipe into another application to then generate the notes with timestamps. We are going to use gpt4o to generate the notes.

We want this to be in a window where we can paste the youtube url and then we get a raw transcript and then we can generate the notes either as a default note prompt or as a custom note prompt.

We want to use  amazing ui that is modern and clean and round like google.
