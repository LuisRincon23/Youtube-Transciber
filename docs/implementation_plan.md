We are going to build a YouTube transcriber And Audio File transciber to then generate notes with timestamps, while also having a feature to chat with a chat bot that has the context of the transcript. We are going to use this github repo https://github.com/jdepoix/youtube-transcript-api/tree/master. To use to get the Youtube Transcripts For the Audio Transciber we are going to use this Repo 
We are going to get the transcript using this repo and we will pipe into another application to then generate the notes with timestamps. We are going to use gpt4o to generate the notes.

We want this to be in a window where we can paste the youtube url and then we get a raw transcript and then we can generate the notes either as a default note prompt or as a custom note prompt.

We want to use  amazing ui that is modern and clean and round like google.
